<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a, b, c, and d are initialized with the values 0, 50, 50, and 100 respectively from the input.
The code calculates the maximum of 0 and the result of (min(b, d) - max(a, c)).
Here, min(b, d) calculates the minimum between 50 and 100, which is 50.
max(a, c) calculates the maximum between 0 and 50, which is 50.
Thus, min(b, d) - max(a, c) results in 50 - 50 = 0.
Finally, max(0, 0) is 0.
The code then prints this result, which is 0.
<<<Output>>>
0
