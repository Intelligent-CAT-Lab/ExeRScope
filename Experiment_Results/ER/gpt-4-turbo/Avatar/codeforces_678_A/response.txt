<<<Analysis>>>
The variables `vamshi` and `z` are initialized with the values 999999999 and 1, respectively, from the input.
The expression `(vamshi // z + 1) * z` is evaluated as follows:
- `vamshi // z` performs integer division of `vamshi` by `z`, which results in 999999999 since `z` is 1.
- Adding 1 to this result gives 1000000000.
- Multiplying this result by `z` (which is 1) yields 1000000000.
Thus, the output of the code is 1000000000.
