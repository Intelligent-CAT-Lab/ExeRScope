<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a single character input, converts it to its ASCII value using the `ord()` function, increments this value by 1, and then converts it back to a character using the `chr()` function. Given the input 'c', the ASCII value of 'c' is 99. Adding 1 to 99 gives 100, which corresponds to the ASCII value for 'd'. Therefore, the output will be 'd'.
<<<Output>>>
d
