<<<Analysis>>>
The variables `anti`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are initialized to 4, 0, 0, and 4, respectively.
The variables `l` and `m` are calculated as the absolute differences between `anti` and `c`, and `b` and `d`. Thus, `l` is `abs(4 - 0) = 4` and `m` is `abs(0 - 4) = 4`.
The code then checks several conditions:
1. If `anti` equals `c`, which is not true in this case (4 != 0).
2. If `b` equals `d`, which is also not true (0 != 4).
3. If `l` is not equal to `m`, which is false since `l` equals `m` (both are 4).
Since none of the first three conditions are met, the code executes the else block.
The else block prints `anti`, `d`, `c`, `b`, which are 4, 4, 0, 0 respectively.

<<<Output>>>
4 4 0 0
