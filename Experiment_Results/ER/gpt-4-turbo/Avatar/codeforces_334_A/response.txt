<<<Analysis>>>
The input value `n` is set to 6. The variables `i` and `j` are initialized to 1 and `n*n` (which is 36) respectively.
The code enters a while loop that continues as long as `i` is less than `j`.
In each iteration of the loop, it prints the values of `i` and `j`, then increments `i` by 1 and decrements `j` by 1.
The loop will execute and print pairs of `i` and `j` starting from (1, 36) and will continue until `i` is no longer less than `j`. The last pair where `i` is less than `j` is (17, 20).
After this, when `i` becomes 18 and `j` becomes 19, the loop condition `i < j` still holds, so it prints (18, 19). In the next iteration, `i` becomes 19 and `j` becomes 18, and the loop stops as the condition `i < j` is no longer true.
