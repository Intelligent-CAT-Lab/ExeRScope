<<<Analysis>>>
The input consists of two values: '814793613347395' and '1.99', which are assigned to variables `a` and `b` respectively. The code modifies `b` by removing the decimal point, changing '1.99' to '199'. Both `a` and `b` are then converted to integers. The value of `a` remains 814793613347395, and `b` becomes 199. The code then calculates the product of `a` and `b`, which is 814793613347395 * 199 = 162121849846113705. This product is then divided by 100 using integer division, resulting in 1621218498461137. This value is printed as the output.
