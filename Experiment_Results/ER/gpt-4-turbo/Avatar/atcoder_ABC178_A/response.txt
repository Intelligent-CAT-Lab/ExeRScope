<<<Analysis>>>
The variable x is initialized with the input value, which is 0 in this case.
The code then checks if x is equal to 1. If x is 1, it prints 0. Otherwise, it prints 1.
Since the input value 0 is not equal to 1, the condition in the if statement evaluates to False.
Thus, the else part of the code is executed, and it prints 1.
<<<Output>>>
1
