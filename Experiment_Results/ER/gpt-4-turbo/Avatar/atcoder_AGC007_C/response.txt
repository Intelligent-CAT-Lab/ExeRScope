<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes the precision for Decimal operations to 200, ensuring high precision for large or complex decimal calculations. The variables n, d, and x are read from input and converted to Decimal types, with values 1000, 100, and 100 respectively.

The variable `ans` is initialized to 0. This variable will accumulate the result of the formula applied in the loop.

The loop iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), which means it will run 1000 iterations. In each iteration:
- The loop variable `i` is converted to a Decimal.
- The expression `(int(n) - int(i) + 1)` calculates the reverse index of `i` in the range 1 to n.
- This value is divided by `i`, and then multiplied by `(d + x * (int(n) * 2 - 1) / 2)`. The expression `(int(n) * 2 - 1) / 2` simplifies to 999.5, so `x * 999.5` is 99950. Adding `d` (100) results in 100050.
- The result of the above operations is added to `ans`.

After the loop, the accumulated result in `ans` is printed.

Given the complexity of the operations and the high precision required, the exact decimal value is computed and printed.
