<<<Analysis>>>
The variables x1, y1, x2, and y2 are initialized with the values 2, 3, 6, and 6 respectively from the input.
The variable 'a' is calculated as x2 - x1, which results in 6 - 2 = 4.
The variable 'b' is calculated as y2 - y1, which results in 6 - 3 = 3.
The output is calculated using the expressions:
- x2 - b = 6 - 3 = 3
- y2 + a = 6 + 4 = 10
- x1 - b = 2 - 3 = -1
- y1 + a = 3 + 4 = 7
These values are then printed as the output.

<<<Output>>>
3 10 -1 7
