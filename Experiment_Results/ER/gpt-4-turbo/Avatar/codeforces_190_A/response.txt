<<<Analysis>>>
The variables n and m are initialized to 59 and 96, respectively.
The code first checks if n is less than 1, which it is not (since n is 59), so it skips the nested conditions under this check.
Next, the code checks if m is greater than n. Since m (96) is indeed greater than n (59), it enters this block.
Inside this block, it sets `min` to m, which is 96, and `max` to n + m - 1, which calculates to 59 + 96 - 1 = 154.
The code then prints the values of `min` and `max`, which are 96 and 154, respectively.
<<<Output>>>
96 154
