<<<Analysis>>>
The input provided is `1 1 1 1 1 1`. This input is split and converted into an integer list `arr` which will be `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`.

1. The variable `rem` is initialized to 0 and `ones` is initialized to 0 as well.
2. An empty list `string` is created to store results.
3. The value of `ones` is calculated as the remainder of the division of the last element of `arr` by the second element, which is `1 % 1 = 0`.
4. A loop runs from 0 to the second element of `arr` (which is 1), so it runs once:
   - It appends to `string` the result of `math.floor(arr[-1] / arr[1]) + (ones > 0)`. Since `arr[-1] / arr[1]` is `1 / 1 = 1` and `ones > 0` is `False`, it appends `1`.
5. The condition `if not arr[0] == arr[1]` checks if the first and second elements of `arr` are not equal. Since they are equal (`1 == 1`), the code inside this block does not execute.
6. Finally, the code prints each element in `string` followed by a space. Since `string` contains only one element, `1`, it prints `1`.
