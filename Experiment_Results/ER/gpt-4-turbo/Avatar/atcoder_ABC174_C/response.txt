<<<Analysis>>>
The input value for K is 260522. The code first checks if K is even by evaluating `K % 2 == 0`. If K is even, it prints -1 and exits immediately. Since 260522 is an even number, the condition `K % 2 == 0` is true. Therefore, the code will print -1 and terminate without entering the for loop that follows.

<<<Output>>>
-1
