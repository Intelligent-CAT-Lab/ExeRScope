<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string called phrase as input. It initializes a variable ans to 0, which is used to count occurrences of the character "0". The function then splits the input string into words and iterates over each word. For each word, it iterates over each character. If the character is "0", it increments the ans variable by 1. After processing all words and characters, the function returns the value of ans.

For the input "aboba 212 has 0 digits":
1. The string is split into words: ["aboba", "212", "has", "0", "digits"].
2. It iterates over each word:
   - "aboba": No '0' characters.
   - "212": No '0' characters.
   - "has": No '0' characters.
   - "0": Contains one '0' character, so ans becomes 1.
   - "digits": No '0' characters.
3. The final value of ans is 1, as there is only one '0' in the entire phrase.
