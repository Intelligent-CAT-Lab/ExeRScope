<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string 'name' as input. The function first uses the split() method on the input string, which splits the string into a list of words based on spaces. In this case, the input string "Fred Smith" is split into the list ['Fred', 'Smith']. Next, the function uses the join() method with '*' as the separator to join the elements of the list into a single string. The elements of the list ['Fred', 'Smith'] are joined to form the string "Fred*Smith".
<<<Output>>>
'Fred*Smith'
