<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two parameters: num (an integer) and name (a string). Inside the function, a string template f_str is defined with placeholders for the name and num. The format method is used to replace the placeholders in the string template with the values of name and num, respectively. The formatted string is then returned.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the inputs 23 and 'Cornareti', the format method will replace the placeholders in the string 'quiz leader = {}, count = {}' with 'Cornareti' and 23, respectively. Thus, the output will be the string 'quiz leader = Cornareti, count = 23'.
<<<Output>>>
'quiz leader = Cornareti, count = 23'
