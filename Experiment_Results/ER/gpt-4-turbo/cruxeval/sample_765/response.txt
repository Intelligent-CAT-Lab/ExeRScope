<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string 'text' as input and returns the sum of 1 for each character in 'text' that is a digit. The function uses a generator expression to iterate over each character in the string, checking if it is a digit using the 'isdigit()' method. If the character is a digit, the expression yields 1; otherwise, it yields nothing for that character.

For the input 'so456':
- 's' is not a digit, so it contributes 0.
- 'o' is not a digit, so it contributes 0.
- '4' is a digit, so it contributes 1.
- '5' is a digit, so it contributes 1.
- '6' is a digit, so it contributes 1.

The sum of these contributions is 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.
