<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes two lists, `nums` and `mos`, as input. It performs several operations on `nums` based on the values in `mos`.

1. The function first iterates over each element in `mos` and removes all occurrences of that element from `nums`. In this case, `mos` contains `[1]`. The function will remove all occurrences of `1` from `nums`, resulting in `nums` becoming `[3, 2, 4]` after this step.

2. Next, the function sorts the modified `nums` list. Sorting `[3, 2, 4]` results in `[2, 3, 4]`.

3. The function then appends each element from `mos` to the end of the sorted `nums` list. Since `mos` contains `[1]`, the list `nums` becomes `[2, 3, 4, 1]`.

4. Finally, the function checks if the list `nums` is sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing each element with the next one. In the list `[2, 3, 4, 1]`, the element `4` is greater than the next element `1`, which means the list is not sorted in non-decreasing order.

Since the list is not sorted in non-decreasing order, the function returns `False`.
