<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two parameters: a list called nums and an integer called index. It performs the following operations:
1. It accesses the element at the position specified by index in the list nums.
2. It calculates the remainder of this element when divided by 42.
3. It removes the element at the specified index from the list using the pop method, which also returns the value of the element removed.
4. It multiplies the popped element by 2.
5. Finally, it adds the result of the modulus operation to the result of the multiplication.

For the input nums = [3, 2, 0, 3, 7] and index = 3:
- The element at index 3 is 3.
- The modulus of 3 by 42 is 3.
- The pop operation removes the element at index 3 (which is 3) and returns it. After this operation, nums becomes [3, 2, 0, 7].
- The popped element (3) is then multiplied by 2, resulting in 6.
- Adding the modulus result (3) to the multiplication result (6) gives 9.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input ([3, 2, 0, 3, 7], 3) is 9.
