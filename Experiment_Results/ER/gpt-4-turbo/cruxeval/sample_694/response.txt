<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a dictionary d as input. The steps executed in the function are as follows:
1. Calculate the length of the dictionary and subtract 1 to get the index of the last key. For the input dictionary {e=1, d=2, c=3}, the length is 3, so i = 3 - 1 = 2.
2. Retrieve the list of keys from the dictionary and select the key at index i (which is 2). The keys in the input dictionary are ['e', 'd', 'c'], so the key at index 2 is 'c'.
3. Remove the key-value pair corresponding to the key 'c' from the dictionary using the pop method. The dictionary now becomes {e=1, d=2}.
4. Return a tuple containing the key that was removed ('c') and the modified dictionary ({e=1, d=2}).

<<<Output>>>
('c', {'e': 1, 'd': 2})
