<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes an array as input and processes it through several steps:
1. An empty list `array_2` is initialized.
2. The function iterates over each element `i` in the input array.
3. During each iteration, it checks if `i` is greater than 0. If true, `i` is added to `array_2`.
4. After completing the iteration over all elements, `array_2` is sorted in descending order using the `sort(reverse=True)` method.
5. Finally, the sorted `array_2` is returned.

For the input `[4, 8, 17, 89, 43, 14]`:
- All elements are positive, so all are added to `array_2`.
- Sorting `array_2` in reverse order results in `[89, 43, 17, 14, 8, 4]`.

<<<Output>>>
[89, 43, 17, 14, 8, 4]
