<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string `text` as input and initializes a boolean variable `b` to True. It then iterates over each character `x` in the string `text`. During the iteration, if `x` is a digit (checked using `x.isdigit()`), it sets `b` to True. If `x` is not a digit, it sets `b` to False and breaks out of the loop immediately. The function returns the value of `b`.

For the input "-1-3":
1. The first character is '-', which is not a digit. Therefore, `b` is set to False.
2. The loop breaks immediately after encountering '-', without checking the other characters.

Since the loop breaks at the first non-digit character and sets `b` to False, the function will return False.
<<<Output>>>
False
