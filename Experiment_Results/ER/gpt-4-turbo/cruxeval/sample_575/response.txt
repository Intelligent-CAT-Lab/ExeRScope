<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes two parameters: `nums`, which is a list of numbers, and `val`, which is an integer. The function initializes an empty list called `new_list`. It then uses a list comprehension to iterate over each element `i` in `nums`. For each element `i`, it extends `new_list` by repeating `i`, `val` times. After the list comprehension completes, the function returns the sum of all elements in `new_list`.

For the input `f([10, 4], 3)`, the steps are as follows:
1. `nums` is `[10, 4]` and `val` is `3`.
2. The list comprehension processes each element of `nums`:
   - For `i = 10`, it extends `new_list` by `[10, 10, 10]`.
   - For `i = 4`, it extends `new_list` by `[4, 4, 4]`.
3. After processing, `new_list` becomes `[10, 10, 10, 4, 4, 4]`.
4. The sum of `new_list` is calculated as `10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 42`.

Therefore, the output of the function `f([10, 4], 3)` is `42`.
