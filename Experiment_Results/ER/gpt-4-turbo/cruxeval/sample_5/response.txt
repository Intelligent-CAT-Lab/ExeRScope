<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes three parameters: `text`, `lower`, and `upper`. It initializes a counter `count` to zero and an empty list `new_text`. The function iterates over each character in the input string `text`. For each character, it checks if the character is a decimal (digit). If it is, the character is replaced with the value of `lower`; otherwise, it is replaced with the value of `upper`. After this replacement, if the new character is either 'p' or 'C', the counter `count` is incremented by 1. Each processed character is then added to the list `new_text`. Finally, the function returns a tuple containing `count` and the string formed by joining all elements of `new_text`.

For the input `f('DSUWeqExTQdCMGpqur', 'a', 'x')`:
- The characters 'D', 'S', 'U', 'W', 'e', 'q', 'E', 'x', 'T', 'Q', 'd', 'C', 'M', 'G', 'p', 'q', 'u', 'r' are all non-decimal, so they are replaced with 'x'.
- The characters 'C' and 'p' are checked against the list ['p', 'C']. 'C' appears once and 'p' appears once in the transformed text, so `count` becomes 2.
- The final string after replacing all characters with 'x' is 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'.

Therefore, the function returns (2, 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx').

<<<Output>>>
(2, 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx')
