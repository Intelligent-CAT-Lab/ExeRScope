The function `f` takes a list of integers as input and processes it to create a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list and the value is a list of integers. The function iterates through each number `n` in the input list:
1. If `n` is already a key in the dictionary `dic`, it appends `n` to the corresponding list in `dic` and removes the first occurrence of `n` from `lists`.
2. If `n` is not in `dic`, it sets the key `n` in `dic` with a value that is a slice of `lists` from the start up to and including the first occurrence of `n`.

Let's step through the code with the input `[5, 2, 7, 2, 3, 5]`:
- Start with an empty dictionary `dic = {}`.
- First element is 5:
  - 5 is not in `dic`, so `dic[5] = [5]`.
- Next element is 2:
  - 2 is not in `dic`, so `dic[2] = [5, 2]`.
- Next element is 7:
  - 7 is not in `dic`, so `dic[7] = [5, 2, 7]`.
- Next element is 2 (again):
  - 2 is in `dic`, so append 2 to `dic[2]` and remove the first 2 from `lists`, resulting in `dic[2] = [5, 2, 2]`.
- Next element is 3:
  - 3 is not in `dic`, so `dic[3] = [7, 3]`.
- Last element is 5 (again):
  - 5 is in `dic`, so append 5 to `dic[5]` and remove the first 5 from `lists`, resulting in `dic[5] = [5, 5]`.

The final dictionary is `{'5': [5, 5], '2': [5, 2, 2], '7': [5, 2, 7], '3': [7, 3]}`. The output is the string representation of this dictionary with spaces removed.
