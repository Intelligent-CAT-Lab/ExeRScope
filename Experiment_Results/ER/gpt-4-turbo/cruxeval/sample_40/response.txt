<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string 'text' as input and returns a new string that is a left-justified version of the original string. The left-justified version is created by padding the original string on the right with the character "#". The total length of the new string is the length of the original string plus one. 

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "the cow goes moo", we need to:
1. Calculate the length of the input string "the cow goes moo", which is 16 characters.
2. Add 1 to this length, making the total length of the new string 17 characters.
3. Pad the original string "the cow goes moo" on the right with the character "#" to make the total length 17 characters.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "the cow goes moo" is "the cow goes moo#" (16 characters of the original string plus one "#" character to make the length 17).
<<<Output>>>
'the cow goes moo#'
