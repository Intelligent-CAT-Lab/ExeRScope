<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes two strings `s1` and `s2` as input. It initializes an empty list `res` and uses the `rfind` method to find the last occurrence of `s2` in `s1`. The `rfind` method returns the highest index in `s1` where substring `s2` is found, such that `s2` is contained within `s1[start:end]`.

1. Initially, `i` is set to `s1.rfind(s2)`, which finds the last occurrence of "abc" in "abcdefghabc". This occurrence starts at index 9.
2. The loop enters since `i` is not -1. It appends `i + len(s2) - 1` to `res`, which calculates to `9 + 3 - 1 = 11`. This is the index of the last character of the last occurrence of "abc".
3. The `rfind` method is called again with the end parameter set to `i`, to find the next last occurrence of "abc" before the current `i`. This time, it finds "abc" starting at index 0.
4. The loop continues, appending `0 + 3 - 1 = 2` to `res`.
5. The `rfind` method is called again, but now it returns -1 as there are no more occurrences of "abc" before index 0.
6. The loop exits, and the function returns the list `res` which now contains [11, 2].

[11, 2]
