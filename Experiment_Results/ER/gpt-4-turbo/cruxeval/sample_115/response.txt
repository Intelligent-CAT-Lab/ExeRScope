<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes a string `text` as input and processes it to generate a byte string as output. Here's the step-by-step analysis of the function:

1. The function initializes an empty list `res`.
2. It then encodes the input string `text` into its UTF-8 byte representation and iterates over each byte.
3. For each byte `ch`:
   - If `ch` equals 61 (which is the ASCII value for '='), the loop breaks and no further bytes are processed.
   - If `ch` equals 0, the byte is ignored (`pass` is executed).
   - Otherwise, the byte value followed by a semicolon and a space (e.g., `115; `) is encoded into UTF-8 and appended to the list `res`.
4. After the loop, all byte strings in `res` are concatenated together to form the final byte string output.

For the input 'os||agx5':
- The UTF-8 encoding of 'os||agx5' results in the byte sequence: 111, 115, 124, 124, 97, 103, 120, 53.
- These bytes are processed as follows:
  - 111 ('o') -> '111; '
  - 115 ('s') -> '115; '
  - 124 ('|') -> '124; '
  - 124 ('|') -> '124; '
  - 97 ('a') -> '97; '
  - 103 ('g') -> '103; '
  - 120 ('x') -> '120; '
  - 53 ('5') -> '53; '
- All these encoded byte strings are concatenated to form the final output.
