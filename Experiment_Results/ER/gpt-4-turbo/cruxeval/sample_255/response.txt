<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three parameters: text, fill, and size. It first checks if the size is negative, and if so, it converts it to a positive value. However, in this case, the size is 1, so no change is made to the size.

Next, the function checks if the length of the text is greater than the size. Here, the length of 'no asw' is 6, which is greater than the size of 1. Therefore, the function returns the substring of text starting from the position where the length of the text minus the size (6 - 1 = 5), which is the last character of the text.

Thus, the function will return the last character of 'no asw', which is 'w'.
<<<Output>>>
'w'
