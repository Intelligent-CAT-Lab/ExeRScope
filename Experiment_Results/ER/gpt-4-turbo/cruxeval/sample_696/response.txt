<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes a string `text` as input and initializes a variable `s` to 0. It then iterates over the string starting from the second character (index 1) to the end of the string. For each character `text[i]`, it partitions the string `text` into three parts: the part before the last occurrence of `text[i]`, the character `text[i]` itself, and the part after it. The function then adds the length of the part before the last occurrence of `text[i]` to `s`.

Let's analyze the function with the input 'wdj':
1. `i = 1`, `text[i] = 'd'`. The `rpartition` of 'wdj' by 'd' results in ('w', 'd', 'j'). The length of the part before 'd' is 1. So, `s += 1`.
2. `i = 2`, `text[i] = 'j'`. The `rpartition` of 'wdj' by 'j' results in ('wd', 'j', ''). The length of the part before 'j' is 2. So, `s += 2`.

Summing these values, `s = 1 + 2 = 3`.
