<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of strings as input and returns a dictionary where each key is a unique string from the list and the corresponding value is the count of that string in the list.

Here's the step-by-step analysis for the input ["La", "Q", "9", "La", "La"]:
1. Initialize an empty dictionary `occurances`.
2. Iterate over each string in the list:
   - For "La": Check if "La" is not in `occurances`. Since it's not, count occurrences of "La" in the list, which is 3. Add "La": 3 to `occurances`.
   - For "Q": Check if "Q" is not in `occurances`. Since it's not, count occurrences of "Q" in the list, which is 1. Add "Q": 1 to `occurances`.
   - For "9": Check if "9" is not in `occurances`. Since it's not, count occurrences of "9" in the list, which is 1. Add "9": 1 to `occurances`.
   - For the second "La": "La" is already in `occurances`, so skip.
   - For the third "La": "La" is already in `occurances`, so skip.
3. Return the `occurances` dictionary.

The final dictionary will have the counts of each unique string from the input list.

<<<Output>>>
{'La': 3, 'Q': 1, '9': 1}
