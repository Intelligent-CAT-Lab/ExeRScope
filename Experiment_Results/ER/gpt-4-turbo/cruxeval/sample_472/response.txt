<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes a string `text` as input and performs the following operations:
1. It removes all hyphens from the input string and converts it to lowercase using `text.replace('-', '').lower()`. For the input "x--y-z-5-C", this results in "xyz5c".
2. It initializes an empty dictionary `d` to store the frequency of each character.
3. It iterates over each character in the modified string "xyz5c". For each character, it checks if the character is already a key in the dictionary `d`. If it is, it increments the value associated with that key by 1; otherwise, it sets the value to 1.
   - 'x': {'x': 1}
   - 'y': {'x': 1, 'y': 1}
   - 'z': {'x': 1, 'y': 1, 'z': 1}
   - '5': {'x': 1, 'y': 1, 'z': 1, '5': 1}
   - 'c': {'x': 1, 'y': 1, 'z': 1, '5': 1, 'c': 1}
4. The dictionary `d` is then sorted by values (frequencies of characters) using `sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])`. Since all characters appear only once, the sorting does not change the order.
5. Finally, the function returns a list of the keys from the sorted dictionary items, which are the characters in the order they were first encountered.

<<<Output>>>
['x', 'y', 'z', '5', 'c']
