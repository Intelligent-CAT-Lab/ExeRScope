<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes a string `text` as input and processes it to count how many words are the longest seen so far. It initializes two variables: `m` to 0, which keeps track of the maximum length of any word encountered, and `cnt` to 0, which counts how many times a new maximum length is found.

The function splits the input string into words using `text.split()`, and then iterates over each word `i` in the list of words. For each word, it checks if the length of the word `len(i)` is greater than the current maximum length `m`. If it is, it increments the `cnt` by 1 and updates `m` to this new maximum length.

Let's apply this logic to the input "wys silak v5 e4fi rotbi fwj 78 wigf t8s lcl":
- "wys" (length 3): m = 3, cnt = 1 (new max length)
- "silak" (length 5): m = 5, cnt = 2 (new max length)
- "v5" (length 2): no change (length is not greater than current max)
- "e4fi" (length 4): no change (length is not greater than current max)
- "rotbi" (length 5): no change (length is equal to current max)
- "fwj" (length 3): no change (length is not greater than current max)
- "78" (length 2): no change (length is not greater than current max)
- "wigf" (length 4): no change (length is not greater than current max)
- "t8s" (length 3): no change (length is not greater than current max)
- "lcl" (length 3): no change (length is not greater than current max)

Thus, the function will return the value of `cnt`, which is 2, indicating that the maximum length was updated twice during the iteration over the words.
