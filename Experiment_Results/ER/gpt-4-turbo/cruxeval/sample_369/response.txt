<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string var as input and checks its content to determine its type based on certain conditions:
1. `var.isdigit()`: This checks if all characters in the string are digits. The input " 99 777" contains spaces, so this condition is False.
2. `var.replace('.', '', 1).isdigit()`: This checks if the string becomes a digit string after removing one dot. Since " 99 777" does not contain any dots and also includes spaces, this condition is also False.
3. `var.count(' ') == len(var) - 1`: This checks if the string contains spaces equal to the length of the string minus one. For " 99 777", there are two spaces, and the length of the string is 7, so 2 is not equal to 6. Thus, this condition is False.
4. `len(var) == 1`: This checks if the string length is 1. The input " 99 777" is longer than 1 character, so this condition is False.

Since none of the above conditions are met, the function defaults to returning "tuple".
