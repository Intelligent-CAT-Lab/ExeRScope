<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes an input n and iterates over each character in the string representation of n. It checks if each character is a digit using the isdigit() method. If any character is not a digit, it sets n to -1 and breaks out of the loop. If all characters are digits, it returns n unchanged.

For the input "6 ** 2":
1. The input is a string "6 ** 2".
2. The function iterates over each character: '6', ' ', '*', '*', ' ', '2'.
3. The first character '6' is a digit, so the loop continues.
4. The second character ' ' (space) is not a digit, so n is set to -1 and the loop breaks.
5. The function returns -1 because a non-digit character was found.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "6 ** 2" is -1.
<<<Output>>>
-1
