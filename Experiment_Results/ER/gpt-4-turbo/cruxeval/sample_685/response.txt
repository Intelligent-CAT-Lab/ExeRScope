<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two parameters: an array and an element (elem). It returns the result of adding the count of occurrences of elem in the array to the elem itself.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input array [1, 1, 1] and elem -2, we need to:
1. Count how many times -2 appears in the array [1, 1, 1]. Since -2 does not appear in the array, the count is 0.
2. Add this count (0) to the value of elem (-2).

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 1, 1] and -2 is 0 + (-2) = -2.
<<<Output>>>
-2
