<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes a list `lst` as input and initializes an empty list `new`. It also initializes a variable `i` to the last index of the list (`len(lst) - 1`).

The function then iterates over the length of the list `lst`. During each iteration, it checks if the index `i` is even or odd using the condition `i % 2 == 0`. If `i` is even, it appends the negative of the element at index `i` of `lst` to the list `new`. If `i` is odd, it appends the element at index `i` of `lst` to `new`. After each iteration, `i` is decremented by 1.

For the input list `[1, 7, -1, -3]`:
- The initial value of `i` is 3 (since `len(lst) - 1 = 3`).
- In the first iteration, `i = 3` (which is odd), so `lst[3]` (-3) is appended to `new`.
- In the second iteration, `i = 2` (which is even), so `-lst[2]` (1) is appended to `new`.
- In the third iteration, `i = 1` (which is odd), so `lst[1]` (7) is appended to `new`.
- In the fourth iteration, `i = 0` (which is even), so `-lst[0]` (-1) is appended to `new`.

The final list `new` after all iterations is `[-3, 1, 7, -1]`.
