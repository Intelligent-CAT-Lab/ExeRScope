<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three parameters: text, old, and new. It performs replacements in the text based on the conditions provided.

1. The function first checks if the length of the string 'old' is greater than 3. In this case, 'old' is "va", which has a length of 2, so this condition is false.

2. The next condition checks if 'old' is in 'text' and if 'text' does not contain any spaces. Here, 'text' is "avacado", which contains 'old' ("va"), and there are no spaces in "avacado". Therefore, this condition is true.

3. Since the condition is true, the function will replace 'old' ("va") in 'text' with 'new' ("-") multiplied by the length of 'old'. The length of 'old' is 2, so 'new' becomes "--".

4. The replacement will change "avacado" to "a--cado" by replacing "va" with "--".

Therefore, the output of the function f when called with the arguments 'avacado', 'va', and '-' is "a--cado".
