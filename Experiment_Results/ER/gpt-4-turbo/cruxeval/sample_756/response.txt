<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string 'text' as input and checks two conditions:
1. Whether the text is alphanumeric (contains only letters and numbers).
2. Whether all characters in the text are digits.

The function first checks if the input string is alphanumeric and if all characters in it are digits. If both conditions are true, it returns 'integer'. If not, it returns 'string'.

For the input '', the string is empty. An empty string:
- Is considered alphanumeric because there are no characters that violate the alphanumeric condition.
- Also satisfies the condition where all characters are digits, as there are no characters to contradict this.

However, Python's `isalnum()` method returns False for an empty string because there are no characters to be alphanumeric. Therefore, the first condition fails.

Since the first condition fails, the function does not check further and returns 'string'.
<<<Output>>>
'string'
