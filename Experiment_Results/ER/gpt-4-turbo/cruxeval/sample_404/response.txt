<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of characters as input and performs the following operations:
1. It creates a dictionary 'd' using dict.fromkeys() with keys from the input list 'no' and all values set to False. Since dictionary keys are unique, any duplicate characters in the list would be stored only once as keys in the dictionary.
2. The function then returns the sum of a list comprehension. This list comprehension iterates over the keys of the dictionary 'd' and for each key, it adds 1 to the list.
3. The sum() function calculates the total of the elements in the list, which effectively counts the number of unique keys in the dictionary.

For the input ['l', 'f', 'h', 'g', 's', 'b'], the dictionary 'd' will have the keys 'l', 'f', 'h', 'g', 's', 'b' each associated with the value False. Since all these characters are unique, the dictionary will have 6 keys.

The list comprehension will generate a list of six 1s, one for each key. The sum of this list is 6.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input ['l', 'f', 'h', 'g', 's', 'b'] is 6.
