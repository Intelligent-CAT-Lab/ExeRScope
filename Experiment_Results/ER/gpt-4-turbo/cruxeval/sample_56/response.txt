<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string 'sentence' as input and iterates through each character in the string. For each character, it checks if the character is an ASCII character using the method isascii(). If any character is not an ASCII character, the function immediately returns False. If all characters are ASCII characters, the function completes the loop and returns True.

In the case of the input '1z1z1':
1. '1' is checked and is an ASCII character.
2. 'z' is checked and is an ASCII character.
3. '1' is checked again and is an ASCII character.
4. 'z' is checked again and is an ASCII character.
5. '1' is checked again and is an ASCII character.

Since all characters in '1z1z1' are ASCII characters, the function will return True after completing the loop.
<<<Output>>>
True
