<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input. The process involves two main operations:
1. The rstrip() method is applied to the string s. This method removes any trailing whitespace from the end of the string. For the input 'ab        ', rstrip() removes the spaces, resulting in the string 'ab'.
2. The reversed() function is then applied to the result of rstrip(). This function returns an iterator that accesses the elements of the string in reverse order. For the string 'ab', reversed() results in an iterator yielding 'b' followed by 'a'.
3. The ''.join() method takes the iterator from reversed() and joins the elements into a new string. Joining 'b' and 'a' results in the string 'ba'.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'ab        ' is 'ba'.
<<<Output>>>
'ba'
