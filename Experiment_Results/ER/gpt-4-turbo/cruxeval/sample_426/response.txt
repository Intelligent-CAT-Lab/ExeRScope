<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three parameters: a list called numbers, an element called elem, and an integer called idx. The function inserts the element elem at the index idx in the list numbers using the list's insert method. If the index idx is greater than the length of the list, the element is added at the end of the list.

In this specific call f([1, 2, 3], 8, 5), the list [1, 2, 3] is given with the element 8 to be inserted at index 5. Since the list only has three elements (indices 0 to 2), the index 5 is out of the current bounds of the list. Therefore, the element 8 will be appended to the end of the list.

The resulting list after the insertion will be [1, 2, 3, 8].
<<<Output>>>
[1, 2, 3, 8]
