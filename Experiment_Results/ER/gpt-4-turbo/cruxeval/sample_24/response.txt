<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two parameters: a list called nums and an integer i. The function removes the element at index i from the list nums using the pop method, which also returns the element removed, though this return value is not used in this function. After removing the element, the function returns the modified list.

In this specific call, f([35, 45, 3, 61, 39, 27, 47], 0), the list nums is [35, 45, 3, 61, 39, 27, 47] and i is 0. The pop method will remove the element at index 0, which is 35. After removing 35, the list nums becomes [45, 3, 61, 39, 27, 47]. The function then returns this modified list.
<<<Output>>>
[45, 3, 61, 39, 27, 47]
