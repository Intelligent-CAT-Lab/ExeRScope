<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a dictionary d as input. It initializes an empty list called result. The function then enters a while loop that continues as long as the dictionary has more than 0 keys. Inside the loop, it uses the popitem() method to remove an item from the dictionary and append this item as a tuple to the result list. The popitem() method removes and returns the last item inserted into the dictionary. The loop continues until the dictionary is empty. The order of items being removed and appended to the result list depends on the order they were inserted into the dictionary, but since dictionaries in Python 3.7+ maintain insertion order, the items will be removed in reverse order of their insertion. Given the dictionary {5: 1, 'abc': 2, 'defghi': 2, 87.29: 3}, the items will be removed in the reverse order of their keys, starting with the last inserted item.

<<<Output>>>
[(87.29, 3), ('defghi', 2), ('abc', 2), (5, 1)]
