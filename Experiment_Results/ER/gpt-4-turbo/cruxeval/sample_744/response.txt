<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two parameters: 'text' and 'new_ending'. The function first converts the string 'text' into a list of its characters. In this case, 'text' is 'jro', so it becomes ['j', 'r', 'o']. Then, it extends this list by appending each character from the string 'new_ending' to it. Here, 'new_ending' is 'wdlp', so the list becomes ['j', 'r', 'o', 'w', 'd', 'l', 'p']. Finally, the function joins these characters back into a single string using the ''.join() method, resulting in 'jrowdlp'. Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the inputs 'jro' and 'wdlp' is 'jrowdlp'.
<<<Output>>>
'jrowdlp'
