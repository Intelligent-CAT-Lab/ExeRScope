<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes two parameters: `text`, a string that may contain multiple lines, and `ch`, a character. It processes each line of `text` based on the following rules:
1. Split the `text` into lines using `splitlines()`.
2. Initialize an empty list `result`.
3. Iterate over each line:
   - If the line is not empty and starts with the character `ch`, convert the line to lowercase and append it to `result`.
   - Otherwise, convert the line to uppercase and append it to `result`.
4. Join all elements of `result` with a newline character and return the resulting string.

For the input `f("t\nza\na", "t")`:
- The `text` "t\nza\na" is split into lines: ["t", "za", "a"].
- The first line "t" starts with "t", so it is converted to lowercase (remains "t") and added to `result`.
- The second line "za" does not start with "t", so it is converted to uppercase ("ZA") and added to `result`.
- The third line "a" does not start with "t", so it is converted to uppercase ("A") and added to `result`.
- The final `result` list is ["t", "ZA", "A"], which is then joined to form the string "t\nZA\nA".
