<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of numbers (nums) as input. It initializes an empty list called digits. The function then iterates through each element in the input list nums. For each element, it checks if the element is either an integer or a string that is numeric. If the condition is true, the element is appended to the digits list. After the loop, the digits list is converted to a list of integers using the map function, ensuring all elements are integers, and then returned.

For the input [0, 6, '1', '2', 0]:
1. 0 is an integer, so it is appended to digits.
2. 6 is an integer, so it is appended to digits.
3. '1' is a string that is numeric, so it is appended to digits.
4. '2' is a string that is numeric, so it is appended to digits.
5. 0 is an integer, so it is appended to digits.

After the loop, the digits list is [0, 6, '1', '2', 0]. The map function converts all elements to integers, resulting in [0, 6, 1, 2, 0]. This list is then returned.

<<<Output>>>
[0, 6, 1, 2, 0]
