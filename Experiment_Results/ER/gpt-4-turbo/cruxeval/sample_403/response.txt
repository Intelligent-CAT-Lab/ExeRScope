<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes two strings as input: `full` and `part`. It calculates the number of times the substring `part` appears in `full`, but only in non-overlapping occurrences.

1. The length of `part` ('hr') is calculated to be 2.
2. The function searches for the first occurrence of `part` in `full` using `full.find(part)`. Initially, `full` is 'hrsiajiajieihruejfhbrisvlmmy', and `part` is found at index 0.
3. A `while` loop is initiated where it continues as long as `index` is not -1 (indicating that `part` is found in `full`).
4. Inside the loop:
   - The substring of `full` starting from `index + length` (index 0 + length 2 = 2) is assigned back to `full`. Now, `full` becomes 'siajiajieihruejfhbrisvlmmy'.
   - The function searches for `part` in this new `full`, finding it next at index 10 (in the substring 'hruejfhbrisvlmmy').
   - `full` is updated to the substring starting from index 12, resulting in 'isvlmmy'.
   - The search for `part` in 'isvlmmy' results in -1 (not found).
5. The loop ends as `index` becomes -1.
6. The count of non-overlapping occurrences of `part` in `full` is 2.

Therefore, the function returns the count, which is 2.
