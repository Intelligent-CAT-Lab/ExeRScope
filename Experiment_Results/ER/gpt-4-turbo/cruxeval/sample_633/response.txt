<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two parameters: an array and an element (elem) to find in that array. The function performs the following steps:
1. It first reverses the array. Initially, the array is [5, -3, 3, 2]. After reversing, it becomes [2, 3, -3, 5].
2. It then tries to find the index of the element 'elem' (which is 2 in this case) in the reversed array. In the reversed array [2, 3, -3, 5], the element 2 is at index 0.
3. The function uses a try-finally block. The try block contains the code to find the index, and the finally block ensures that the array is reversed back to its original order before the function returns. After reversing back, the array becomes [5, -3, 3, 2] again.
4. The function returns the index found in step 2, which is 0.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input ([5, -3, 3, 2], 2) is 0.
