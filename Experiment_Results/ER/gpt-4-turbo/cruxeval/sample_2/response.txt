<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string 'text' as input and converts it into a list of characters called 'new_text'. The function then iterates over the string '+'. Since '+' is a single character, the loop iterates only once. Inside the loop, it checks if the character '+' is present in 'new_text'. If it is found, it removes that character from 'new_text'. After the loop, the function joins the characters in 'new_text' back into a string and returns it.

In this specific case, the input string is 'hbtofdeiequ'. The character '+' is not present in this string. Therefore, the list 'new_text' remains unchanged. The function then joins the unchanged list of characters back into a string and returns it.

<<<Output>>>
'hbtofdeiequ'
