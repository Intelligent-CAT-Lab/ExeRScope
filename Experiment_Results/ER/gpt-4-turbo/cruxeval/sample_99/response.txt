<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three parameters: text, sep, and num. It uses the Python string method rsplit, which splits the string 'text' from the right by the separator 'sep' a maximum of 'num' times. The result of this split is a list of substrings. The function then joins these substrings using the string '___' as the separator.

For the input 'aa+++bb', '+', 1:
1. The rsplit method will split the string 'aa+++bb' from the right by the separator '+' a maximum of 1 time. This results in the list ['aa++', 'bb'] because only the last '+' is used to split the string.
2. The join operation with '___' will then concatenate these substrings, resulting in 'aa++___bb'.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input ('aa+++bb', '+', 1) is 'aa++___bb'.

'aa++___bb'
