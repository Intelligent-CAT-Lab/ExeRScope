<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes a list `nums` as input. It initializes `a` to -1 and `b` to all elements of `nums` starting from the second element (i.e., `nums[1:]`). The function then enters a while loop that continues as long as `a` is less than or equal to the first element of `b`.

1. Initial values:
   - `nums = [-1, 5, 3, -2, -6, 8, 8]`
   - `a = -1`
   - `b = [5, 3, -2, -6, 8, 8]`

2. First iteration:
   - `a <= b[0]` is `-1 <= 5`, which is true.
   - Remove `b[0]` (which is 5) from `nums`, resulting in `nums = [-1, 3, -2, -6, 8, 8]`.
   - Set `a = 0`.
   - Update `b` to `b[1:]`, resulting in `b = [3, -2, -6, 8, 8]`.

3. Second iteration:
   - `a <= b[0]` is `0 <= 3`, which is true.
   - Remove `b[0]` (which is 3) from `nums`, resulting in `nums = [-1, -2, -6, 8, 8]`.
   - `a` remains 0.
   - Update `b` to `b[1:]`, resulting in `b = [-2, -6, 8, 8]`.

4. Third iteration:
   - `a <= b[0]` is `0 <= -2`, which is false.
   - The loop exits.

The final value of `nums` after the loop exits is `[-1, -2, -6, 8, 8]`.
