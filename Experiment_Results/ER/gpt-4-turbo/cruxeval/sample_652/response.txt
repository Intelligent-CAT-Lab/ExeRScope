<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string as input and first checks if the string is empty or if the first character of the string is not numeric. If either condition is true, it returns 'INVALID'. In this case, the input string is '3', which is not empty and the first character '3' is numeric.

Next, the function initializes a variable `cur` to 0. It then iterates over each character in the string. Since the string '3' has only one character, the loop will run once. During the iteration, it converts the character '3' to an integer and updates `cur` by multiplying the current value of `cur` (which is 0) by 10 and then adding the integer value of the character. Thus, `cur` becomes 0 * 10 + 3 = 3.

Finally, the function returns the value of `cur` converted back to a string. Therefore, the output of the function f when called with the input '3' is the string '3'.
