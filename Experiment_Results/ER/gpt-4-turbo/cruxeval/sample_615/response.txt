<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two parameters: a list `in_list` and a number `num`. It performs the following operations:
1. Appends `num` to `in_list`. After this operation, `in_list` becomes `[-1, 12, -6, -2, -1]`.
2. Finds the index of the maximum value in the list excluding the last element. The list excluding the last element is `[-1, 12, -6, -2]`. The maximum value in this sublist is 12.
3. Returns the index of this maximum value, which is 1 (since indices start at 0 and 12 is at the second position).

Therefore, the function will return the index 1.
