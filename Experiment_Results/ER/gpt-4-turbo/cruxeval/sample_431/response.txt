<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two parameters, n and m. It first creates a list 'arr' containing integers from 1 to n inclusive. Then, it iterates m times, and in each iteration, it clears the list 'arr' using the clear() method. The clear() method removes all items from the list, making it empty.

For the specific call f(1, 3):
1. The list 'arr' is initially created with elements from 1 to 1, which is [1].
2. The loop runs 3 times since m is 3. In each iteration, the list 'arr' is cleared.
3. After the first iteration, 'arr' becomes empty and remains empty for the subsequent iterations.

Thus, after the loop completes, 'arr' is still empty, and the function returns an empty list.
