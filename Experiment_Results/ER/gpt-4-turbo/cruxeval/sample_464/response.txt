<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string ans as input. It first checks if the string is composed only of decimal digits using the isdecimal() method. If true, it proceeds with the following calculations:
1. Converts the string ans to an integer and multiplies it by 4, then subtracts 50. For the input '0', this calculation is (0 * 4) - 50 = -50.
2. It then subtracts 100 times the length of a list comprehension that filters out characters in ans that are not in the string '02468'. Since '0' is in '02468', the list comprehension returns an empty list, and its length is 0. Thus, -100 * 0 = 0.
3. The total after these calculations for the input '0' is -50 + 0 = -50.

If the input string is not decimal, the function returns 'NAN'. However, since '0' is a decimal, this part of the function is not executed.

<<<Output>>>
-50
