<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes a list of numbers `nums` as input. The function first iterates through a copy of the list `nums` to remove all odd numbers from the original list. This is done using the condition `if odd % 2 != 0`, which checks if a number is odd, and if so, it is removed from `nums`.

For the input `[11, 21, 0, 11]`:
1. The first number `11` is odd, so it is removed. The list becomes `[21, 0, 11]`.
2. The next number in the iteration is `21` (since `11` was removed, `21` is now the first element in the list). `21` is also odd, so it is removed. The list becomes `[0, 11]`.
3. The next number is `0`, which is even, so it remains.
4. The last number in the iteration is `11`, which is odd, so it is removed. The list becomes `[0]`.

After removing all odd numbers, the function sums the remaining numbers in the list. In this case, the remaining list is `[0]`. The sum of the elements in `[0]` is `0`.

Therefore, the output of executing the function `f` on the input `[11, 21, 0, 11]` is `0`.
