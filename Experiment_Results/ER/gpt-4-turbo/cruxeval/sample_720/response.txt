<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes two parameters: `items` and `item`. The function first checks if the last element in the list `items` is equal to `item`. If it is, it removes the last element from the list using `pop()` until the last element is not equal to `item`. After exiting the loop, it appends `item` to the list `items` and then returns the length of the modified list.

In this specific call, `f('bfreratrrbdbzagbretaredtroefcoiqrrneaosf'.split('-'), 'n')`, the input string is split by the character '-'. Since there are no '-' characters in the string, the result of the split operation is a list containing the original string as a single element: `['bfreratrrbdbzagbretaredtroefcoiqrrneaosf']`.

The function then checks if the last element of this list, which is the entire string, is equal to 'n'. Since it is not, the function skips the while loop and directly appends 'n' to the list. The list now becomes `['bfreratrrbdbzagbretaredtroefcoiqrrneaosf', 'n']`.

Finally, the function returns the length of this list, which is 2.
