<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two parameters: a list of numbers called nums, and a number called target. It calculates the number of times the target appears in the list nums using the count method. This count is stored in the variable cnt. The function then returns twice the value of cnt.

For the input nums = [1, 1] and target = 1, the count method will find that the number 1 appears twice in the list. Therefore, cnt will be 2. The function then returns 2 times 2, which equals 4.

<<<Output>>>
4
