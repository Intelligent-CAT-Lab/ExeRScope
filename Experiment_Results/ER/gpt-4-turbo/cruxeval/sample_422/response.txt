<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list called array as input. The first step in the function is to create a copy of this list, which is stored in new_array. This ensures that the original list is not modified during the function's execution.

Next, the function attempts to reverse the list using the reversed() function. However, it's important to note that reversed() returns an iterator, not a list. This iterator represents the list in reverse order.

The final step in the function is to iterate over this reversed iterator and compute the square of each element. This is done using a list comprehension, which iterates over each element x in the reversed iterator and calculates x*x. The result is a new list containing these squared values.

For the input [1, 2, 1], the steps are as follows:
1. Copy the list to new_array, so new_array = [1, 2, 1].
2. Reverse new_array using reversed(), which gives an iterator over the elements [1, 2, 1] in reverse order, i.e., [1, 2, 1].
3. Calculate the square of each element in the reversed list: 1*1, 2*2, 1*1, resulting in [1, 4, 1].

<<<Output>>>
[1, 4, 1]
