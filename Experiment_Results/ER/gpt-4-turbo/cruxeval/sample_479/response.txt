<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three parameters: a list called nums, and two integers, pop1 and pop2. The function is designed to remove elements from the list nums. The elements to be removed are determined by the indices pop1 - 1 and pop2 - 1, which adjust the 1-based indices provided (pop1 and pop2) to the 0-based indexing used in Python lists.

Step-by-step execution for the input `f([1, 5, 2, 3, 6], 2, 4)`:
1. The initial list is nums = [1, 5, 2, 3, 6].
2. pop1 = 2, so pop1 - 1 = 1. The element at index 1 is 5. Removing 5 from nums results in nums = [1, 2, 3, 6].
3. After the first removal, the list indices have shifted. Now, pop2 = 4, so pop2 - 1 = 3. The element at the new index 3 is 6. Removing 6 from the updated nums results in nums = [1, 2, 3].

Thus, the function returns the list [1, 2, 3] after removing the elements at the specified positions.

[1, 2, 3]
