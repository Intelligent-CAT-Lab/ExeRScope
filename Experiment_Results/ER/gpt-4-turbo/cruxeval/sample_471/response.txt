<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two parameters: a character 'val' and a string 'text'. It first creates a list called 'indices' which contains the indices of all occurrences of the character 'val' in the string 'text'. This is done using a list comprehension that iterates over the range of the length of 'text' and checks if the character at each index matches 'val'.

For the input 'o' and 'fnmart', the function will iterate over the indices 0 to 5 (since 'fnmart' has a length of 6). It checks each character:
- 'f' at index 0 does not match 'o'
- 'n' at index 1 does not match 'o'
- 'm' at index 2 does not match 'o'
- 'a' at index 3 does not match 'o'
- 'r' at index 4 does not match 'o'
- 't' at index 5 does not match 'o'

Since none of the characters in 'fnmart' match 'o', the list 'indices' remains empty.

After constructing the 'indices' list, the function checks if the list is empty. If it is, it returns -1. Otherwise, it would return the first element of the list (i.e., the index of the first occurrence of 'val' in 'text').

In this case, since 'indices' is empty, the function returns -1.
