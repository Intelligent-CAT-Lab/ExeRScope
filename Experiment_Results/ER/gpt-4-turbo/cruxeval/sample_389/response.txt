<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes two parameters: `total` and `arg`. The `total` parameter is expected to be a list, and `arg` can be either a list or another type. The function checks if `arg` is a list. If `arg` is a list, it iterates through each element `e` in `arg` and extends `total` by `e`. If `arg` is not a list, it directly extends `total` by `arg`.

In the given call `f([1, 2, 3], 'nammo')`, `total` is `[1, 2, 3]` and `arg` is the string `'nammo'`. Since `arg` is not a list, the `else` part of the condition will execute. The `extend` method of the list takes an iterable and appends each of its elements to the list. When a string is passed to `extend`, it treats the string as a sequence of its characters. Therefore, each character of the string `'nammo'` will be added to the list `[1, 2, 3]`.

Thus, the list will be extended to include 'n', 'a', 'm', 'm', 'o', resulting in the list `[1, 2, 3, 'n', 'a', 'm', 'm', 'o']`.

<<<Output>>>
[1, 2, 3, 'n', 'a', 'm', 'm', 'o']
