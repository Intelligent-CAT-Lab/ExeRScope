<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a dictionary called marks as input, where each key-value pair represents an identifier and a numerical mark respectively. The function initializes two variables, highest and lowest, to 0 and 100 respectively. It then iterates over the values of the dictionary. For each value, it checks if the value is greater than the current highest value; if so, it updates highest to that value. Similarly, it checks if the value is less than the current lowest value; if so, it updates lowest to that value. After iterating through all values, the function returns a tuple containing the highest and lowest values found.

For the input {'x': 67, 'v': 89, '': 4, 'alij': 11, 'kgfsd': 72, 'yafby': 83}:
- Start with highest = 0, lowest = 100.
- Iteration over values:
  - 67: Update highest to 67 (since 67 > 0). Lowest remains 100 (since 67 > 4).
  - 89: Update highest to 89 (since 89 > 67). Lowest remains 100.
  - 4: Highest remains 89. Update lowest to 4 (since 4 < 100).
  - 11: Highest remains 89. Lowest remains 4.
  - 72: Highest remains 89. Lowest remains 4.
  - 83: Highest remains 89. Lowest remains 4.
- The final values of highest and lowest are 89 and 4 respectively.

<<<Output>>>
(89, 4)
