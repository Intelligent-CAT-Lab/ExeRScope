<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes two parameters: `tuple_list`, which is a tuple of integers, and `joint`, which is a string used as a separator. The function initializes an empty string `string`. It then iterates over each number in `tuple_list`.

For each number in the tuple:
1. The number is converted to a string.
2. `dict.fromkeys(str(num), joint * len(str(num)))` creates a dictionary where each character of the string representation of the number is a key, and the value for each key is the `joint` string repeated as many times as the length of the number string.
3. `.popitem()` removes and returns an arbitrary key-value pair from the dictionary. Since all keys have the same value, it effectively picks the first unique character of the number string and its associated value.
4. The key (first unique character of the number string) and the `joint` string are concatenated to `string`.

After processing all numbers, the function returns the `string`.

For the input `f((32332, 23543, 132323, 33300), ',')`:
- For `32332`, the first unique character is '3', and the joint string repeated 5 times (length of '32332') is ',,,,,', so the result is '3,'
- For `23543`, the first unique character is '2', and the joint string repeated 5 times is ',,,,,', so the result is '2,'
- For `132323`, the first unique character is '1', and the joint string repeated 6 times is ',,,,,,', so the result is '1,'
- For `33300`, the first unique character is '3', and the joint string repeated 5 times is ',,,,,', so the result is '3,'

Concatenating all these results gives '3,2,1,3,'.

<<<Output>>>
'3,2,1,3,'
