<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of strings (items) as input. It initializes an empty list called result. The function then iterates over each string in the items list. For each string, it iterates over each character (d) in the string. If the character d is not a digit (checked using d.isdigit()), it appends this character to the result list. After processing all strings and their characters, the function returns the result list.

For the input ['123', 'cat', 'd dee']:
1. For the first item '123':
   - '1' is a digit, so it is not added to result.
   - '2' is a digit, so it is not added to result.
   - '3' is a digit, so it is not added to result.
2. For the second item 'cat':
   - 'c' is not a digit, so it is added to result.
   - 'a' is not a digit, so it is added to result.
   - 't' is not a digit, so it is added to result.
3. For the third item 'd dee':
   - 'd' is not a digit, so it is added to result.
   - ' ' (space) is not a digit, so it is added to result.
   - 'd' is not a digit, so it is added to result.
   - 'e' is not a digit, so it is added to result.
   - 'e' is not a digit, so it is added to result.

The final result list will be ['c', 'a', 't', 'd', ' ', 'd', 'e', 'e'].
<<<Output>>>
['c', 'a', 't', 'd', ' ', 'd', 'e', 'e']
