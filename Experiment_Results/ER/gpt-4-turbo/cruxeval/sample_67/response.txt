<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three numbers as input: num1, num2, and num3. In this case, these numbers are 6, 8, and 8 respectively.
1. The function starts by creating a list nums containing the input numbers: nums = [6, 8, 8].
2. It then sorts the list nums in ascending order. After sorting, the list nums remains [6, 8, 8] as 6 is less than 8 and the two 8s are equal.
3. Finally, the function returns a formatted string that concatenates the sorted numbers separated by commas. This is achieved using f-string formatting: f'{nums[0]},{nums[1]},{nums[2]}'.
Thus, the output will be the string "6,8,8".

<<<Output>>>
'6,8,8'
