<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string 'text' as input and performs the following steps:
1. Converts the string into a list of characters, stored in 'new_text'.
2. Iterates over each index of 'new_text'.
3. For each character at index i, it swaps its case (uppercase to lowercase, lowercase to uppercase) using the swapcase() method and stores the swapped character back at the same index.
4. After completing the iteration for all characters, it joins the list of characters back into a single string.
5. Returns the newly formed string.

For the input 'dst vavf n dmv dfvm gamcu dgcvb.', the function will process each character:
- 'd' becomes 'D'
- 's' becomes 'S'
- 't' becomes 'T'
- ' ' (space) remains ' '
- 'v' becomes 'V'
- 'a' becomes 'A'
- 'v' becomes 'V'
- 'f' becomes 'F'
- 'n' becomes 'N'
- 'd' becomes 'D'
- 'm' becomes 'M'
- 'v' becomes 'V'
- 'd' becomes 'D'
- 'f' becomes 'F'
- 'v' becomes 'V'
- 'm' becomes 'M'
- 'g' becomes 'G'
- 'a' becomes 'A'
- 'm' becomes 'M'
- 'c' becomes 'C'
- 'u' becomes 'U'
- 'd' becomes 'D'
- 'g' becomes 'G'
- 'c' becomes 'C'
- 'v' becomes 'V'
- 'b' becomes 'B'
- '.' (period) remains '.'

Thus, the output string after processing all characters will be 'DST VAVF N DMV DFVM GAMCU DGCVB.'.
<<<Output>>>
'DST VAVF N DMV DFVM GAMCU DGCVB.'
