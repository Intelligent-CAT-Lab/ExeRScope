The function `f` takes two parameters: a list `a` and a string `b`. The function first joins the elements of the list `a` using the string `b` as the separator. In this case, `a` is `["a", "b", "c"]` and `b` is `" "`, so the result of the join operation is the string `"a b c"`.

Next, the function initializes an empty list `lst`. It then iterates over the string `"a b c"` with a step of 2 in the range from 1 to the length of the string plus 1. In each iteration, it performs two operations:
1. It appends a substring of the current string starting from the current index minus 1 and extending for `i` characters.
2. It appends another substring starting from the current index minus 1 and extending beyond `i` characters.

Let's break down the iterations:
- For `i = 1`: The substring from index 0 to 1 is `"a"`, and the substring from index 1 onwards is `" b c"`.
- For `i = 3`: The substring from index 2 to 5 is `"b c"`, and the substring from index 5 onwards is an empty string `""`.
- For `i = 5`: The substring from index 4 to 9 is `"c"`, and the substring from index 9 onwards is an empty string `""`.

Thus, the list `lst` will be populated as follows: `["a", " b c", "b c", "", "c", ""]`.

<<<Output>>>
['a', ' b c', 'b c', '', 'c', '']
