<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes a string `sample` as input and aims to find the position of the last '/' character before any encoded '/' (represented as '%2F'). It initializes `i` to -1 and uses a while loop to update `i` to the position of the next '/' found in `sample`, starting from the index `i+1`. The loop continues until no more '/' characters are found.

In the given input 'present/here/car%2Fwe':
1. The first '/' is found at index 7 (`present/`).
2. The second '/' is found at index 12 (`present/here/`).
3. The loop stops as there are no more '/' characters after index 12.

After exiting the loop, `i` is 12. The function then returns the index of the last '/' character before index 12 using `sample.rindex('/', 0, i)`. This method searches backwards from index 12 to find the last occurrence of '/'.

Thus, the last '/' before index 12 is at position 7.
