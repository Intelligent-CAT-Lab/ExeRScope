<<<Analysis>>>
The function f is designed to remove all occurrences of two specified numbers (odd1 and odd2) from a list (nums). The function uses two while loops to achieve this:
1. The first while loop continues to remove occurrences of the number stored in odd1 from the list nums until no more instances of odd1 are found.
2. The second while loop does the same for the number stored in odd2.

For the given input:
- nums = [1, 2, 3, 7, 7, 6, 8, 4, 1, 2, 3, 5, 1, 3, 21, 1, 3]
- odd1 = 3
- odd2 = 1

The function will first remove all occurrences of 3 from nums. After this operation, nums will look like:
[1, 2, 7, 7, 6, 8, 4, 1, 2, 5, 1, 21, 1]

Next, the function will remove all occurrences of 1 from nums. After this operation, nums will look like:
[2, 7, 7, 6, 8, 4, 2, 5, 21]

The final result returned by the function will be the modified list [2, 7, 7, 6, 8, 4, 2, 5, 21].
<<<Output>>>
[2, 7, 7, 6, 8, 4, 2, 5, 21]
