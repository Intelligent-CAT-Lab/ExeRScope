<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two parameters: a string 'text' and a substring 'sub'. It is designed to find all the starting indices of occurrences of 'sub' in 'text'.

1. An empty list 'index' is initialized to store the starting indices of each occurrence of 'sub' in 'text'.
2. A variable 'starting' is initialized to 0 to keep track of the current position in 'text' from where the search for 'sub' should begin.
3. A while loop runs as long as 'starting' is not equal to -1, indicating that there are still parts of 'text' left to search.
4. Inside the loop, 'text.find(sub, starting)' is used to find the index of the first occurrence of 'sub' starting from the index 'starting'. If 'sub' is found, its index is stored in 'starting'.
5. If 'starting' is not -1 (meaning 'sub' was found), the found index is appended to the 'index' list.
6. The 'starting' is then incremented by the length of 'sub' to skip over the current occurrence of 'sub' and continue searching in the subsequent part of 'text'.
7. If 'sub' is not found, 'starting' becomes -1, and the loop ends.
8. Finally, the list 'index' containing all the starting indices of 'sub' in 'text' is returned.

For the specific input 'text' as 'egmdartoa' and 'sub' as 'good':
- The substring 'good' does not appear in 'egmdartoa'.
- Therefore, the 'find' method will return -1 on its first call, and the loop will not execute any further.
- The list 'index' remains empty as there are no occurrences of 'sub' in 'text'.
