<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes two parameters: a string `a` and a character `split_on`. The function first splits the string `a` into a list `t` using whitespace as the delimiter. In this case, the input string "booty boot-boot bootclass" is split into ["booty", "boot-boot", "bootclass"].

Next, the function initializes an empty list `a`. It then iterates over each word in the list `t`. For each word, it iterates over each character in the word and appends each character to the list `a`. After processing all words, the list `a` will contain every character from the original string `a` as individual elements, including hyphens but excluding spaces.

The function then checks if the character `split_on`, which is 'k' in this case, is present in the list `a`. If 'k' is found, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

From the input string "booty boot-boot bootclass", the characters are split and added to the list `a`. The character 'k' is present in the word "bootclass", so it will be in the list `a`.

Therefore, the function should return `True` since 'k' is found in the list `a`.
