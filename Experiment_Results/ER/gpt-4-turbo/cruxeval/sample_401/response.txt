<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two parameters: 'text' and 'suffix'. It checks if 'suffix' is not empty and if 'text' ends with 'suffix'. If both conditions are true, it returns 'text' with the 'suffix' removed from the end. If either condition is false, it returns 'text' unchanged.

In this specific case, the input parameters are 'text' = "mathematics" and 'suffix' = "example". The function first checks if 'suffix' is not empty, which is true since "example" is not an empty string. Next, it checks if 'text' ends with 'suffix'. "mathematics" does not end with "example", so this condition is false.

Since the condition to remove the suffix is not met (the text does not end with the suffix), the function will return the 'text' parameter unchanged.

<<<Output>>>
"mathematics"
