The function `f` takes a string `text` as input and processes it to count occurrences of transformed characters based on a specific mapping defined in the dictionary `name`. The dictionary `name` maps 'a' to 'b', 'b' to 'c', 'c' to 'd', 'd' to 'e', and 'e' to 'f'. If a character is not in the dictionary, it remains unchanged.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown for the input "URW rNB":
1. For each character in "URW rNB":
   - 'U' is not in the dictionary, so it remains 'U'.
   - 'R' is not in the dictionary, so it remains 'R'.
   - 'W' is not in the dictionary, so it remains 'W'.
   - ' ' (space) is not in the dictionary, so it remains ' '.
   - 'r' is not in the dictionary, so it remains 'r'.
   - 'N' is not in the dictionary, so it remains 'N'.
   - 'B' is mapped to 'c' according to the dictionary.
2. The occurrences dictionary `occ` will then count each of these characters:
   - 'U': 1 time
   - 'R': 1 time
   - 'W': 1 time
   - ' ': 1 time
   - 'r': 1 time
   - 'N': 1 time
   - 'c': 1 time (from 'B')
3. The function returns a list of the values from the `occ` dictionary, which are the counts of each character.

Therefore, the output will be a list of the counts of each character as they appear in the transformed string.
