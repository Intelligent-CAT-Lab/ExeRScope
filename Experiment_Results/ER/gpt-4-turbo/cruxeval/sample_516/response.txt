<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two parameters: a list of strings called 'strings' and a string called 'substr'. It filters the list 'strings' to include only those strings that start with the substring 'substr'. This is done using a list comprehension. After filtering, the function returns the filtered list sorted by the length of the strings.

In the given call f(['condor', 'eyes', 'gay', 'isa'], 'd'), the function will first filter the strings that start with 'd'. Among the provided list, only 'condor' starts with 'd'. Therefore, the filtered list will be ['condor'].

Next, the function sorts this list by the length of its elements. Since the list contains only one element, 'condor', it remains unchanged after sorting.

Thus, the output of the function call will be ['condor'].
