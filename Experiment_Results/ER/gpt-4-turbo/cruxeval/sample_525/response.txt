<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes three parameters: a dictionary `c`, and two integers `st` and `ed`. The function initializes an empty dictionary `d` and two integers `a` and `b` both set to 0. It then iterates over the items in dictionary `c`, mapping each value to its corresponding key in dictionary `d`. During this iteration, it also checks if the current value `y` matches `st` or `ed`. If `y` matches `st`, it sets `a` to the key `x` of that item, and similarly for `ed`, it sets `b`.

After the loop, the function retrieves the key `w` from dictionary `d` using `st` as the key. The function then returns a tuple containing `w` and `b`, but the order depends on whether `a` is greater than `b`. If `a` is greater, it returns `(w, b)`, otherwise it returns `(b, w)`.

For the input `f({'TEXT': 7, 'CODE': 3}, 7, 3)`, the dictionary `c` is `{'TEXT': 7, 'CODE': 3}`. The function maps `7` to `'TEXT'` and `3` to `'CODE'` in dictionary `d`. It sets `a` to 7 (since `y` equals `st` which is 7) and `b` to 3 (since `y` equals `ed` which is 3). The key `w` retrieved using `st` (7) from `d` is `'TEXT'`. Since `a` (7) is greater than `b` (3), the function returns `(w, b)` which is `('TEXT', 3)`.

<<<Output>>>
('TEXT', 3)
