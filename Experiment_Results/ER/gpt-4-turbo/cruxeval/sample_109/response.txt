<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes three parameters: a list `nums`, an integer `spot`, and an integer `idx`. The function inserts the value of `idx` into the list `nums` at the position specified by `spot`. The `insert` method modifies the list in place.

For the given input:
- `nums` is initially `[1, 0, 1, 1]`
- `spot` is `0`
- `idx` is `9`

The function will insert the value `9` at the 0th position of the list `nums`. After insertion, the list will be updated to `[9, 1, 0, 1, 1]` as `9` is added at the beginning of the list. The function then returns this modified list.

<<<Output>>>
[9, 1, 0, 1, 1]
