<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes a string `text` as input and processes it to remove certain patterns. The function splits the input string by spaces (though in this case, there are no spaces), and then iterates over each word from the split result. For each word, it attempts to remove patterns where the word is prefixed or suffixed with a hyphen from the original text. Finally, it returns the modified text with any leading or trailing hyphens removed.

Let's break down the input '-stew---corn-and-beans-in soup-.-':
1. The `split()` method will split the string into words based on spaces. Since there are no spaces, the entire string is considered as one "word" in the list: ['-stew---corn-and-beans-in soup-.'].
2. The loop iterates over this list, but since the "word" contains hyphens and other characters without spaces, the `replace` method calls inside the loop will not effectively change the string because they look for patterns like '-{word}' or '{word}-', which do not match the complex structure of the input string.
3. After the loop, the `strip('-')` method is called on the text. This method removes leading and trailing hyphens from the string.

Given the input string and the behavior of the code, the output will be the input string itself with leading and trailing hyphens removed.

'stew---corn-and-beans-in soup-.'
