<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes a list of numbers as input. It then computes a list called `floats` which contains the fractional part of each number in the input list. This is done using the expression `n % 1` for each number `n` in the input list. The modulus operator `%` when used with 1 returns the fractional part of the number.

In this specific case, the input to the function is `range(100, 120)`, which generates numbers from 100 to 119. Since all these numbers are integers, their fractional part (result of `n % 1`) will be 0.

After computing the fractional parts, the function checks if the number 1 is present in the list `floats`. If 1 is present, it returns the list `floats`; otherwise, it returns an empty list. Since all elements in `floats` are 0 (as all input numbers are integers), 1 is not in the list, and thus the function returns an empty list.
