<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string 'text' as input and initializes an empty list 'text_arr'. It then iterates over the length of the input string using a for loop. In each iteration, it appends a substring of 'text' starting from the current index 'j' to the end of the string to 'text_arr'. 

For the input '123':
- When j = 0, the substring from index 0 to the end is '123', which is appended to 'text_arr'.
- When j = 1, the substring from index 1 to the end is '23', which is appended to 'text_arr'.
- When j = 2, the substring from index 2 to the end is '3', which is appended to 'text_arr'.

After completing the loop, 'text_arr' contains ['123', '23', '3'].
<<<Output>>>
['123', '23', '3']
