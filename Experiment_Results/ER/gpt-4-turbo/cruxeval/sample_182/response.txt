<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a dictionary 'dic' as input and returns a sorted list of the dictionary's items. The sorting is based on the keys of the dictionary items, as specified by the lambda function `lambda x: x[0]`, where `x[0]` represents the key of each item.

In this specific case, the input dictionary is `{'b': 1, 'a': 2}`. The items of this dictionary are `('b', 1)` and `('a', 2)`. The sorting function will sort these items based on their keys, resulting in the items being ordered as `('a', 2)` and `('b', 1)` because 'a' comes before 'b' in lexicographical order.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input `{'b': 1, 'a': 2}` will be a list of tuples sorted by keys: `[('a', 2), ('b', 1)]`.
<<<Output>>>
[('a', 2), ('b', 1)]
