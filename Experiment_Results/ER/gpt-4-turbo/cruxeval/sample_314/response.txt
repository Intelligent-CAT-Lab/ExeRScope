<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string 'text' as input and checks if there is a comma (',') in the text. If there is a comma, it uses the partition method to split the text at the first occurrence of the comma into three parts: the part before the comma (before), the comma itself (_), and the part after the comma (after). It then returns a string that concatenates 'after', a space, and 'before'.

For the input '244, 105, -90':
1. The text contains a comma, so the function proceeds with the partition.
2. The partition method splits the text into 'before' = '244', '_' = ',', 'after' = ' 105, -90'.
3. The function returns 'after + " " + before', which results in ' 105, -90' + ' ' + '244'.

Therefore, the output will be ' 105, -90 244'.
