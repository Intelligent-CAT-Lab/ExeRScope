<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes two parameters: `text` and `sub`. It initializes two variables `a` and `b` to represent the start and end indices of the `text`, respectively. The function then enters a while loop that continues as long as `a` is less than or equal to `b`.

Inside the loop, it calculates the middle index `c` between `a` and `b`. It then checks if the last occurrence of the substring `sub` in `text` is greater than or equal to `c`. If true, it sets `a` to `c + 1`, effectively moving the start of the search range to the right. If false, it sets `b` to `c - 1`, narrowing the search range by moving the end to the left.

The loop continues adjusting the values of `a` and `b` based on the position of the last occurrence of `sub` relative to `c` until `a` is greater than `b`.

For the input `f('dorfunctions', '2')`, the substring '2' does not exist in the string 'dorfunctions'. Therefore, `text.rfind('2')` returns -1. Since -1 is not greater than or equal to any middle index calculated, `b` will be adjusted downwards in each iteration of the loop until `a` exceeds `b`.

Let's trace the values:
- Initial values: `a = 0`, `b = 11` (length of 'dorfunctions' - 1)
- First iteration: `c = 5`, `text.rfind('2') = -1` (not >= 5), so `b = 4`
- Second iteration: `c = 2`, `text.rfind('2') = -1` (not >= 2), so `b = 1`
- Third iteration: `c = 0`, `text.rfind('2') = -1` (not >= 0), so `b = -1`

At this point, `a` (0) is greater than `b` (-1), and the loop exits. The function returns the value of `a`, which is 0.
