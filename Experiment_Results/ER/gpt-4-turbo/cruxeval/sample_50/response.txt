<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list lst as input. The first operation inside the function is lst.clear(), which removes all elements from the list, making it an empty list []. Next, the expression lst += [1] * (len(lst) + 1) is evaluated. Since lst is now empty, len(lst) is 0. Therefore, [1] * (0 + 1) results in [1]. The list lst is then extended by this single-element list, resulting in lst becoming [1]. Finally, the function returns the modified list lst, which now contains a single element [1].
<<<Output>>>
[1]
