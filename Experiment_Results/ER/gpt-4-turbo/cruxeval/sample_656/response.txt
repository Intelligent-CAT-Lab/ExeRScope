<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of letters as input. It initializes an empty list `a`. The function then iterates through each element in the input list `letters`. For each element, it checks if the element is already in list `a`. If it is, the function returns 'no'. If the element is not in list `a`, it appends the element to `a`. After iterating through all elements, if no duplicate is found, the function returns 'yes'.

For the input `['b', 'i', 'r', 'o', 's', 'j', 'v', 'p']`, the function will process each character:
1. 'b' is not in `a`, so it is added to `a`.
2. 'i' is not in `a`, so it is added to `a`.
3. 'r' is not in `a`, so it is added to `a`.
4. 'o' is not in `a`, so it is added to `a`.
5. 's' is not in `a`, so it is added to `a`.
6. 'j' is not in `a`, so it is added to `a`.
7. 'v' is not in `a`, so it is added to `a`.
8. 'p' is not in `a`, so it is added to `a`.

Since no character is repeated in the list, the function will return 'yes' after all iterations are complete.

<<<Output>>>
'yes'
