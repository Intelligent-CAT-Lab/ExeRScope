<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two lists, arr1 and arr2, as input. It performs the following steps:
1. Creates a copy of arr1 and assigns it to new_arr. This ensures that the original arr1 is not modified.
2. Extends new_arr with the elements of arr2 using the extend method. This appends each element of arr2 to the end of new_arr.
3. Returns the modified new_arr.

For the given input arr1 = [5, 1, 3, 7, 8] and arr2 = ['', 0, -1, []]:
- new_arr initially becomes a copy of arr1: [5, 1, 3, 7, 8].
- new_arr is then extended with the elements of arr2, resulting in: [5, 1, 3, 7, 8, '', 0, -1, []].

Thus, the final output after executing the function f with the provided inputs is [5, 1, 3, 7, 8, '', 0, -1, []].
<<<Output>>>
[5, 1, 3, 7, 8, '', 0, -1, []]
