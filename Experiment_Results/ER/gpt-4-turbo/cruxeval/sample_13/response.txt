<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of strings (names) as input. It initializes two variables: count, which stores the length of the list names, and numberOfNames, initialized to 0, which will count the number of strings in the list that contain only alphabetic characters.

1. The function calculates the length of the input list ['sharron', 'Savannah', 'Mike Cherokee'], which is 3, and assigns this value to count.
2. The function then iterates over each element in the list:
   - For 'sharron', since all characters are alphabetic, numberOfNames is incremented by 1.
   - For 'Savannah', since all characters are alphabetic, numberOfNames is incremented by 1.
   - For 'Mike Cherokee', since the string contains a space (which is not an alphabetic character), numberOfNames is not incremented.
3. After iterating through the list, numberOfNames is 2, as only two strings ('sharron' and 'Savannah') are composed solely of alphabetic characters.

The function returns the value of numberOfNames, which is 2.
