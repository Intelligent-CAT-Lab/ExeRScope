The function `f` takes an integer `n` as input. It defines a dictionary `values` with keys 0, 1, and 2, and corresponding values 3, 4.5, and '-'. An empty dictionary `res` is also initialized.

The function then iterates over the items in `values`. For each key-value pair `(i, j)`, it checks if `i % n` is not equal to 2. If this condition is true, it adds the value `j` as a key to the `res` dictionary with the value `n // 2`.

Given `n = 12`, the iterations and checks are as follows:
- For `i = 0`, `j = 3`: `0 % 12` is 0, which is not equal to 2. Thus, `res` is updated to `{3: 6}`.
- For `i = 1`, `j = 4.5`: `1 % 12` is 1, which is not equal to 2. Thus, `res` is updated to `{3: 6, 4.5: 6}`.
- For `i = 2`, `j = '-'`: `2 % 12` is 2, which is equal to 2. Thus, `res` remains `{3: 6, 4.5: 6}`.

Finally, the function returns the sorted list of keys from the `res` dictionary. The keys are 3 and 4.5, and when sorted, the list is `[3, 4.5]`.

[3, 4.5]
