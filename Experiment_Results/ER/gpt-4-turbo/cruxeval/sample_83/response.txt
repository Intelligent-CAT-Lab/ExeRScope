<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes a string `text` as input and processes it to find the position of the last '0' and the substring following it. Here's the step-by-step analysis for the input 'qq0tt':

1. The function uses `text.rpartition('0')` to split the string into a tuple `l` at the last occurrence of '0'. For the input 'qq0tt', this results in `l = ('qq', '0', 'tt')`.
2. It then checks if `l[2]` (the substring after the last '0') is empty. If it is, the function would return '-1:-1', but in this case, `l[2]` is 'tt'.
3. Since `l[2]` is not empty, the function proceeds to calculate the output string. It calculates the length of `l[0]` (which is 'qq') as 2. This represents the position of the last '0' in the original string.
4. It then checks for the position of '0' in `l[2]`. Since there is no '0' in 'tt', `l[2].find("0")` returns -1. Adding 1 to this result gives 0.
5. The function returns the string formatted as '2:0', where 2 is the position of the last '0' in the original string, and 0 indicates that there is no '0' in the substring following the last '0'.

<<<Output>>>
'2:0'
