<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three parameters: text, suffix, and num. It first converts the integer num to a string and stores it in str_num. Then, it concatenates suffix with str_num to form a new string. The function then checks if the text ends with this newly formed string using the endswith method.

For the input 'friends and love', 'and', 3:
1. The num 3 is converted to the string "3".
2. The suffix "and" is concatenated with "3" to form "and3".
3. The function checks if 'friends and love' ends with "and3".

Since 'friends and love' ends with "love" and not "and3", the result of the endswith method will be False.
<<<Output>>>
False
