<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string input and checks if the string is alphanumeric using the isalnum() method. The isalnum() method returns True if all characters in the string are alphanumeric (either alphabets or numbers) and there is at least one character, otherwise it returns False. In this case, the input to the function f is '777'. Since '777' consists only of numeric characters, it is considered alphanumeric. Therefore, the isalnum() method will return True. According to the function f, if the input string is alphanumeric, it returns the string "True". Hence, for the input '777', the function will return "True".
<<<Output>>>
