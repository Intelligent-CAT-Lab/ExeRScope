<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes two parameters: `text` and `froms`. It first strips characters from the beginning of `text` that are in `froms` using `lstrip()`, and then strips characters from the end of `text` that are in `froms` using `rstrip()`.

In this specific call `f('0 t 1cos ', 'st ' + '0\t\n  ')`, the `froms` string is `'st ' + '0\t\n  '`. This concatenation results in a string containing 's', 't', ' ', '0', tab, newline, and additional spaces. These characters are considered for stripping from both ends of the `text`.

1. `text` = '0 t 1cos '
2. `froms` = 'st 0\t\n  ' (spaces, tab, newline, 's', 't', '0')

Applying `lstrip()`:
- Strips '0' and spaces from the beginning of `text`, resulting in 't 1cos '.

Applying `rstrip()`:
- Strips space from the end of the modified `text`, resulting in 't 1cos'.

Thus, the final output after both stripping operations is 't 1cos'.
