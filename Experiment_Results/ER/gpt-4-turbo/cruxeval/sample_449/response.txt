<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string x as input and initializes two variables: n, which is the length of the string x, and i, which is set to 0. The function then enters a while loop that continues as long as i is less than n and the character at position i in the string x is a digit. Inside the loop, i is incremented by 1 each time the condition is met.

For the input '1':
1. n is set to 1 because the length of '1' is 1.
2. i starts at 0.
3. The while loop checks if i (0) is less than n (1) and if x[0] ('1') is a digit. Both conditions are true.
4. i is incremented to 1.
5. The loop condition is checked again. Now i is not less than n (both are 1), so the loop exits.
6. The function checks if i equals n. Since both are 1, the condition is true.

The function returns True because all characters in the input string are digits and the loop has successfully checked each character without finding a non-digit character.

True
