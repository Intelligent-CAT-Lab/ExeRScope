The function `f` takes two parameters: `text` and `suffix`. It recursively removes characters from the end of `text` if they match the characters from the end of `suffix` in reverse order.

1. Initial call: `f('rpyttc', 'cyt')`
   - `suffix[-1]` is 't', which is found at the end of `text`.
   - The function is called recursively with `text` stripped of the last 't': `f('rpytc', 'cy')`.

2. Second call: `f('rpytc', 'cy')`
   - `suffix[-1]` is 'y', which is found at the end of `text`.
   - The function is called recursively with `text` stripped of the last 'y': `f('rpyt', 'c')`.

3. Third call: `f('rpyt', 'c')`
   - `suffix[-1]` is 'c', which is not found at the end of `text`.
   - The function returns `text` as it is: 'rpyt'.

The final output after all recursive calls is 'rpyt'.
