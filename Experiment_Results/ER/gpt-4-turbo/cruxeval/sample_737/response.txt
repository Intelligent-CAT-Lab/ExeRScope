<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of numbers as input and initializes a variable `counts` to 0. It then iterates through each element in the list `nums`. For each element, it checks if the string representation of the element is decimal using the `isdecimal()` method. The `isdecimal()` method returns True if all characters in the string are decimals and there is at least one character, otherwise False. If `counts` is 0 and the element is decimal, it increments `counts` by 1. However, the increment happens only once because the condition `if counts == 0` ensures that `counts` is incremented only the first time an element satisfying the `isdecimal()` condition is found.

In the given input `[0, 6, 2, -1, -2]`:
- `0` is decimal, and since `counts` is 0, `counts` becomes 1.
- `6` is decimal, but `counts` is no longer 0, so it remains 1.
- `2` is decimal, but `counts` is still 1, so it remains 1.
- `-1` is not decimal.
- `-2` is not decimal.

Thus, the function will return `counts` which is 1.
