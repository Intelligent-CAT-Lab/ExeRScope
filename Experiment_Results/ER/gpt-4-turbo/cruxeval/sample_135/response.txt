<<<Analysis>>>
The function f initializes a dictionary named 'd' with two keys: 'Russia' and 'Kazakhstan'. Each key is associated with a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a city name and the country name. The function then returns a list of the keys of the dictionary 'd'. The keys of the dictionary 'd' are 'Russia' and 'Kazakhstan'. Therefore, the function will return a list containing these two strings.
<<<Output>>>
['Russia', 'Kazakhstan']
