<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes a string as input and checks if the string is alphanumeric using the `isalnum()` method. The `isalnum()` method returns `True` if all characters in the string are alphanumeric (letters and numbers) and there is at least one character; otherwise, it returns `False`.

In this case, the input string is 'Str zahrnuje anglo-ameriæske vasi piscina and kuca!'. This string contains spaces and special characters (like 'æ' and '!'), which are not considered alphanumeric. Therefore, the `isalnum()` method will return `False`.

Since `isalnum()` returns `False`, the function will execute the `return "more than ASCII"` statement.

<<<Output>>>
'more than ASCII'
