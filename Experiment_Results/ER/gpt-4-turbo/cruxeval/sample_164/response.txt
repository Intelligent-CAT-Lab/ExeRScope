<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list lst as input. The first operation inside the function is to sort the list lst. Sorting the list [5, 8, 1, 3, 0] results in [0, 1, 3, 5, 8]. After sorting, the function returns the first three elements of the sorted list. Therefore, the slice lst[0:3] of the sorted list [0, 1, 3, 5, 8] is [0, 1, 3].
<<<Output>>>
[0, 1, 3]
