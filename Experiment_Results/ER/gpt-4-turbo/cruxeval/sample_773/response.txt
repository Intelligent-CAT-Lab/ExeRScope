<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two parameters: a list called nums and an integer n. The function returns the result of the method nums.pop(n), which removes and returns the element at index n from the list nums.
In this specific call, f([-7, 3, 1, -1, -1, 0, 4], 6), the list provided is [-7, 3, 1, -1, -1, 0, 4] and the index n is 6. The element at index 6 in the list is 4. Therefore, the pop method will remove the element 4 from the list and return it.
<<<Output>>>
4
