<<<Analysis>>>
The function f checks if the list nums is a palindrome. A list is considered a palindrome if it reads the same forward and backward.
1. The input list is [0, 3, 6, 2].
2. The function first reverses the list using nums[::-1], resulting in [2, 6, 3, 0].
3. It then compares the reversed list [2, 6, 3, 0] with the original list [0, 3, 6, 2].
4. Since [2, 6, 3, 0] is not equal to [0, 3, 6, 2], the function returns False.
