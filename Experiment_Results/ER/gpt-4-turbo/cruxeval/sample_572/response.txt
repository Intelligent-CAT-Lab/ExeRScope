The function `f` takes two parameters: a dictionary `data` and an integer `num`. It performs the following steps:
1. Converts the dictionary `data` into a list of its items, which are key-value pairs, and stores this list in `temp`.
2. Initializes an empty dictionary `new_dict`.
3. Iterates over the list `temp` from the last element to the element at index `num`, decrementing by 1 each time. During each iteration, it adds the current item from `temp` to `new_dict` with its value set to `None`.
4. Returns a new list that concatenates the slice of `temp` from index `num` to the end with the items of `new_dict`.

For the input `data = {1: 9, 2: 10, 3: 1}` and `num = 1`:
- `temp` will be `[(1, 9), (2, 10), (3, 1)]`.
- The loop will iterate starting from index 2 (last index) to index 1. It will add `(3, 1)` to `new_dict` with value `None`, resulting in `new_dict = {(3, 1): None}`.
- The slice `temp[1:]` is `[(2, 10), (3, 1)]`.
- The final output will be the concatenation of `[(2, 10), (3, 1)]` with the items of `new_dict`, which are `[((3, 1), None)]`.
