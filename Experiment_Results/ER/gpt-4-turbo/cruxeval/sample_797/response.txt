<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a dictionary `dct` as input. It initializes an empty list `lst`. The function then iterates over the keys of the dictionary `dct`, which are sorted in ascending order. For each key in the sorted order, it appends a tuple to the list `lst`. This tuple consists of the key and the corresponding value from the dictionary `dct`. The sorted keys for the input dictionary `{'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}` are 'a', 'b', and 'c'. The function processes these keys in sorted order:
1. For key 'a', it appends ('a', 1) to `lst`.
2. For key 'b', it appends ('b', 2) to `lst`.
3. For key 'c', it appends ('c', 3) to `lst`.
Finally, the function returns the list `lst` which now contains the tuples [('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3)].

<<<Output>>>
[('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3)]
