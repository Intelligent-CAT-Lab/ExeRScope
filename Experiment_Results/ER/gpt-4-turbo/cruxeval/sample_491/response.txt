The function `f` takes a list `xs` as input. It iterates over the list from the last element to the first element (inclusive) in reverse order. For each element `xs[i]` during the iteration, it extends the list `xs` by appending two copies of `xs[i]`.

Let's break down the execution for the input `[4, 8, 8, 5]`:
1. Initial list: `[4, 8, 8, 5]`
2. First iteration (`i = -1`): The last element is `5`. The list is extended by two `5`s: `[4, 8, 8, 5, 5, 5]`
3. Second iteration (`i = -2`): The second last element (now) is `8`. The list is extended by two `8`s: `[4, 8, 8, 5, 5, 5, 8, 8]`
4. Third iteration (`i = -3`): The third last element (now) is `8`. The list is extended by two `8`s: `[4, 8, 8, 5, 5, 5, 8, 8, 8, 8]`
5. Fourth iteration (`i = -4`): The fourth last element (now) is `4`. The list is extended by two `4`s: `[4, 8, 8, 5, 5, 5, 8, 8, 8, 8, 4, 4]`

The function then returns the modified list.

[4, 8, 8, 5, 5, 5, 8, 8, 8, 8, 4, 4]
