<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes two parameters: `mess`, a string, and `char`, a character. The function aims to remove all occurrences of `char` that appear after the last occurrence of `char` in `mess`.

1. Initially, `mess` is '0aabbaa0b' and `char` is 'a'.
2. The function enters a while loop that continues as long as there is an occurrence of `char` after the last occurrence of `char` found by `mess.rindex(char) + 1`.
3. The `rindex` method finds the last occurrence of `char` ('a') in `mess`, which is at index 6.
4. The `find` method checks if there is another 'a' after index 6 + 1 (index 7). Since there isn't, the `find` method returns -1.
5. The while loop condition `mess.find(char, mess.rindex(char) + 1) != -1` evaluates to False because `find` returned -1.
6. The function exits the loop and returns `mess` as it is, which is '0aabbaa0b'.

Therefore, the function does not modify the string and returns it unchanged.

<<<Output>>>
'0aabbaa0b'
