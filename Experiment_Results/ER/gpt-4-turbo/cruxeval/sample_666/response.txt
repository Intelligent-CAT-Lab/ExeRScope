The function `f` takes two dictionaries `d1` and `d2` as input. It initializes a variable `mmax` to 0, which is used to keep track of the maximum sum of the lengths of corresponding lists from `d1` and `d2`.

The function iterates over each key `k1` in `d1`. For each key, it calculates `p` as the sum of the length of the list in `d1` corresponding to `k1` and the length of the list in `d2` corresponding to `k1`. If `k1` does not exist in `d2`, an empty list is used (thanks to the `get` method with a default value of `[]`).

Here's the step-by-step breakdown for the given input:
1. For `k1 = 0`: 
   - `d1[0]` is `[]` (length 0)
   - `d2[0]` is `[0, 0, 0, 0]` (length 4)
   - `p = 0 + 4 = 4`
   - Since `p` (4) is greater than `mmax` (0), `mmax` is updated to 4.
2. For `k1 = 1`:
   - `d1[1]` is `[]` (length 0)
   - `d2[1]` does not exist, so an empty list is used (length 0)
   - `p = 0 + 0 = 0`
   - `p` is not greater than `mmax` (4), so `mmax` remains 4.

The function then returns the value of `mmax`, which is 4.
