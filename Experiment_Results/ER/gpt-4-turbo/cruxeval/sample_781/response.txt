<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two parameters: a string `s` and a character `ch`. It performs the following operations:
1. Checks if `ch` is not in `s`. If `ch` is not found, it returns an empty string.
2. If `ch` is found, it partitions the string `s` at the first occurrence of `ch`. The `partition` method returns a tuple (part before `ch`, `ch`, part after `ch`). The function then takes the part after `ch` and reverses it.
3. It then enters a loop that runs for the length of the reversed string obtained in step 2. In each iteration, it again partitions the reversed string at the first occurrence of `ch`, takes the part after `ch`, and reverses it.
4. Finally, it returns the string obtained after all iterations of the loop.

For the input `f('shivajimonto6', '6')`:
- `ch` ('6') is found in `s` ('shivajimonto6').
- The string is partitioned at '6', resulting in the tuple ('shivajimonto', '6', ''). The part after '6' is an empty string, which when reversed remains an empty string.
- The loop runs for the length of the reversed string (which is 0), so no iterations occur.
- The function returns the empty string.
