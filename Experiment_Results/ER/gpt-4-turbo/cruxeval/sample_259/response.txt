<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes a string `text` as input and processes it to generate a new string based on certain conditions:
1. It initializes an empty list `new_text`.
2. It iterates over each character in the input string `text`.
3. For each character, it checks if the character is uppercase using `character.isupper()`.
4. If the character is uppercase, it inserts this character into the `new_text` list at the position calculated by `len(new_text) // 2`. This effectively places each new uppercase character in the middle of the current list.
5. After processing all characters, it checks if `new_text` is empty. If it is, it sets `new_text` to `['-']`.
6. Finally, it joins all elements of `new_text` into a single string and returns it.

For the input 'String matching is a big part of RexEx library.', the uppercase characters are 'S' and 'R'. The function processes these characters as follows:
- 'S' is inserted at position `0 // 2 = 0`.
- 'R' is inserted at position `1 // 2 = 0`.

Thus, the list `new_text` becomes `['R', 'S']` after processing all characters. The function then joins these to form the string "RS".

<<<Output>>>
'RS'
