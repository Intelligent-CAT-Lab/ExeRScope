<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a single argument, named string. Inside the function, there is a try block that attempts to execute the method rfind('e') on the string. The rfind method returns the highest index in the string where the substring 'e' is found. If 'e' is not found, it returns -1. If the input is not a string and does not have the rfind method, an AttributeError would be raised, and the except block would return "Nuk".

For the input 'eeuseeeoehasa', the function will successfully find the method rfind since the input is a string. The rfind('e') will search for the last occurrence of 'e'. In the string 'eeuseeeoehasa', the last 'e' appears at index 9 (0-based index).

Therefore, the function will return 9.
<<<Output>>>
9
