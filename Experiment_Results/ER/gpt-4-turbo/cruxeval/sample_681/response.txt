<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes three parameters: an array, an index `ind`, and an element `elem`. It inserts the element `elem` into the array at a specific position determined by the value of `ind`. The position where `elem` is inserted is calculated as follows:
- If `ind` is less than 0, the element is inserted at position -5.
- If `ind` is greater than the length of the array, the element is inserted at the end of the array.
- Otherwise, the element is inserted at position `ind + 1`.

In the given call `f([1, 5, 8, 2, 0, 3], 2, 7)`, the array is `[1, 5, 8, 2, 0, 3]`, `ind` is 2, and `elem` is 7. Since `ind` (2) is neither less than 0 nor greater than the length of the array (6), the element 7 is inserted at position `ind + 1` which is 2 + 1 = 3. 

Inserting 7 at position 3 in the array `[1, 5, 8, 2, 0, 3]` results in the array becoming `[1, 5, 8, 7, 2, 0, 3]`.

<<<Output>>>
[1, 5, 8, 7, 2, 0, 3]
