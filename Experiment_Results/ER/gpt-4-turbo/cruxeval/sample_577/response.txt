<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes a list of tuples `items` as input and initializes an empty list `result`. It then iterates over each tuple in `items`. For each iteration:
1. It converts `items` into a dictionary and makes a copy of this dictionary, storing it in `d`.
2. It removes the last item from `d` using `popitem()`.
3. It appends the modified dictionary `d` to the list `result`.
4. It updates `items` to be the modified dictionary `d` for the next iteration.

For the input `[(1, 'pos')]`:
- The list `items` contains one tuple, so the loop will run once.
- The tuple is converted into a dictionary `d` with `{1: 'pos'}`.
- `popitem()` removes the last item, making `d` an empty dictionary `{}`.
- The empty dictionary is appended to `result`, making `result` equal to `[{}]`.
- `items` is updated to the empty dictionary `{}`.

Since there are no more items to iterate over, the loop ends and the function returns `result`, which is `[{}]`.
