<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two parameters: a string 'text' and a string 'strip_chars'. The function performs the following operations:
1. It reverses the string 'text'. For the input 'tcmfsmj', reversing it results in 'jmsfmct'.
2. It then strips characters from both ends of the reversed string that are found in 'strip_chars'. In this case, 'strip_chars' contains 'cfj'. From 'jmsfmct', the 'j' at the beginning and 'c' at the end are stripped, resulting in 'msfm'.
3. Finally, it reverses the stripped string again. Reversing 'msfm' results in 'mfsm'.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the inputs 'tcmfsmj' and 'cfj' is 'mfsm'.
<<<Output>>>
'mfsm'
