The function f takes a dictionary d as input and performs the following operations:
1. It sorts the items of the dictionary by keys in descending order and selects the first item's key, which is the largest key. This key is stored in `key1`.
2. It removes the key-value pair corresponding to `key1` from the dictionary using the `pop` method, and the value is stored in `val1`.
3. It repeats the sorting process for the remaining items in the dictionary and selects the new largest key, storing it in `key2`.
4. It removes the key-value pair corresponding to `key2` from the dictionary using the `pop` method again, and the value is stored in `val2`.
5. Finally, it returns a new dictionary containing the two key-value pairs that were removed.

For the input dictionary `{2: 3, 17: 3, 16: 6, 18: 6, 87: 7}`:
- The sorted keys in descending order initially are [87, 18, 17, 16, 2].
- `key1` is 87, and `val1` is 7. After removing this key-value pair, the dictionary becomes `{2: 3, 17: 3, 16: 6, 18: 6}`.
- The sorted keys now are [18, 17, 16, 2].
- `key2` is 18, and `val2` is 6. After removing this key-value pair, the dictionary becomes `{2: 3, 17: 3, 16: 6}`.
- The function returns the dictionary `{87: 7, 18: 6}`.

<<<Output>>>
{87: 7, 18: 6}
