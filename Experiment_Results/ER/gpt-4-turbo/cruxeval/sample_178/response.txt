<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two parameters: an array and an integer n. It returns a new list that starts from the index n of the input array and includes all subsequent elements. 
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input array [0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2] with n = 4, we need to slice the array starting from index 4. The elements from index 4 to the end of the array are [2, 2, 2].
Therefore, the output of executing the function f with these inputs is [2, 2, 2].
<<<Output>>>
[2, 2, 2]
