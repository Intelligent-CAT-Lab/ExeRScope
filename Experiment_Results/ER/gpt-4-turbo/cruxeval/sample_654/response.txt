<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes three parameters: a string `s`, a string `from_c`, and a string `to_c`. It uses these parameters to replace occurrences of characters in `s` that match characters in `from_c` with corresponding characters in `to_c`.

1. The function is called with `s` as 'aphid', `from_c` as 'i', and `to_c` as '?'.
2. Inside the function, `table = s.maketrans(from_c, to_c)` creates a translation table. This table maps the character 'i' in `from_c` to the character '?' in `to_c`.
3. `s.translate(table)` uses the translation table to replace occurrences of 'i' in 'aphid' with '?'.
4. The resulting string after translation is 'aph?d'.

Therefore, the output of executing the function `f` on the input 'aphid', 'i', '?' is 'aph?d'.
