<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two parameters: a string 'text' and a string 'splitter'. The function performs the following operations:
1. Converts the entire 'text' string to lowercase using the .lower() method.
2. Splits the lowercase string into a list of words using the .split() method, which by default splits by whitespace.
3. Joins the list of words using the 'splitter' string provided as the second argument.

For the input 'LlTHH sAfLAPkPhtsWP' with the splitter '#':
- The string is first converted to lowercase, resulting in 'llthh saflapkphtswp'.
- This string is then split into words, resulting in the list ['llthh', 'saflapkphtswp'].
- These words are then joined using the '#' character, resulting in 'llthh#saflapkphtswp'.

<<<Output>>>
'llthh#saflapkphtswp'
