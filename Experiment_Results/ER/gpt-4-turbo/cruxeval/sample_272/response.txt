<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes two parameters: `base_list` and `nums`. It first extends `base_list` by appending all elements from `nums`. After this operation, `base_list` becomes `[9, 7, 5, 3, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 0]`.

Next, the function creates a copy of this extended list and assigns it to `res`. At this point, `res` is also `[9, 7, 5, 3, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 0]`.

The function then enters a loop that iterates from `-len(nums)` to `0`. Since `len(nums)` is 5, the loop iterates from `-5` to `0`. This range covers the last five elements of the `res` list. During each iteration, the function appends the current element (pointed by index `i`) from `res` to itself. The indices `-5` to `-1` correspond to the elements `2, 4, 6, 8, 0` respectively.

Thus, after the loop, `res` becomes `[9, 7, 5, 3, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 0]`.

Finally, the function returns the modified `res` list.
