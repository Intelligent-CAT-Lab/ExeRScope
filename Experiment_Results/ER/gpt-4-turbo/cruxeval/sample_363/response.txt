<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of numbers as input. Here's the step-by-step analysis for the input [1]:

1. The list [1] is already sorted, so `nums.sort()` does not change the list.
2. The length of the list `n` is calculated to be 1.
3. `new_nums` is initialized with the middle element of `nums`, which is [1] because `n//2` equals 0 (integer division).
4. Since `n % 2` is not 0 (it is 1), the condition inside the if statement is not executed.
5. The for loop is set to iterate from 0 to `n//2` (which is 0). Since the range is from 0 to 0, the loop does not execute.
6. The function returns `new_nums`, which remains as [1].

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [1] is [1].
