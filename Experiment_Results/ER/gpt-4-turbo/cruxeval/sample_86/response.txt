<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three parameters: instagram, imgur, and wins. It starts by creating a list called photos containing the values of instagram and imgur.

1. The function first checks if instagram is equal to imgur. In this case, instagram is ['sdfs', 'drcr', '2e'] and imgur is ['sdfs', 'dr2c', 'QWERTY']. Since these two lists are not equal, the function does not return the value of wins at this point.

2. Next, the function checks if wins equals 1. In this case, wins is 0, so this condition is also false.

3. Since neither of the above conditions are met, the function proceeds to the else block. Here, it reverses the list photos. Initially, photos is [['sdfs', 'drcr', '2e'], ['sdfs', 'dr2c', 'QWERTY']]. After reversing, photos becomes [['sdfs', 'dr2c', 'QWERTY'], ['sdfs', 'drcr', '2e']].

4. Finally, the function returns the result of photos.pop(), which removes and returns the last element of the list photos. After reversing, the last element is ['sdfs', 'drcr', '2e'].

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the given inputs is ['sdfs', 'drcr', '2e'].
