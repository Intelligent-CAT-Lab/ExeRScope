<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes two parameters: a string `s` and a separator `sep`. It performs the following steps:
1. The string `s` is split into a list using `sep` as the delimiter. For the input 'volume' and 'l', the split operation divides 'volume' into ['vo', 'ume'].
2. A list comprehension adds a '*' to the beginning of each element in the list resulting from the split. This transforms ['vo', 'ume'] into ['*vo', '*ume'].
3. The `reversed` function is applied to reverse the order of the list. Applying `reversed` to ['*vo', '*ume'] results in ['*ume', '*vo'].
4. The `';'.join()` method concatenates the elements of the reversed list into a single string, with each element separated by a semicolon. This results in '*ume;*vo'.

<<<Output>>>
'*ume;*vo'
