<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes two arguments: `original` and `string`. Both are dictionaries. The function starts by creating a copy of the `original` dictionary and stores it in `temp`. It then iterates over the `string` dictionary. For each key-value pair `(a, b)` in `string`, it modifies `temp` such that the value of `b` in `temp` is set to `a`.

Step-by-step for the given input:
1. `original` is `{1: -9, 0: -7}` and `string` is `{1: 2, 0: 3}`.
2. `temp` is initialized as a copy of `original`, so `temp` is `{1: -9, 0: -7}`.
3. The loop iterates over `string`. The first pair is `(1, 2)`. This modifies `temp` to `{1: -9, 0: -7, 2: 1}`.
4. The next pair is `(0, 3)`. This modifies `temp` to `{1: -9, 0: -7, 2: 1, 3: 0}`.

Thus, the final state of `temp` after processing the input is `{1: -9, 0: -7, 2: 1, 3: 0}`.
<<<Output>>>
{1: -9, 0: -7, 2: 1, 3: 0}
