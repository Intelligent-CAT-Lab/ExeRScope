<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes two parameters: `array` and `elem`. The `array` is expected to be a dictionary, and `elem` can be any value that might be a key or value in the dictionary.

1. The function starts by creating a copy of the input dictionary `array` and assigns it to `result`.
2. It then enters a while loop that continues as long as `result` is not empty.
3. Inside the loop, it uses `popitem()` to remove and return an arbitrary key-value pair from `result`. The key and value are stored in variables `key` and `value`.
4. It checks if `elem` matches either the key or the value. If a match is found, it updates `result` with the original `array` again.
5. Regardless of whether a match was found, it deletes the key from `result` using `del result[key]`.
6. The loop continues until `result` is empty.

In this specific case, the input dictionary is empty (`{}`), and `elem` is `1`.

- Since the dictionary `result` is initially a copy of an empty dictionary, it is also empty.
- The while loop condition `while result:` fails immediately because `result` is empty.
- Therefore, the loop does not execute, and no modifications are made to `result`.

The function returns `result`, which remains an empty dictionary.
