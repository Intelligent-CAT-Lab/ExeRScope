<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list 'num' as input. The function performs the following operations:
1. It appends the last element of the list 'num' to the end of the same list. This is done using the expression num[-1], which accesses the last element of the list, and num.append(), which appends this element to the list.
2. It then returns the modified list.

For the input list [-70, 20, 9, 1]:
- The last element of the list is 1.
- The function appends 1 to the end of the list, modifying the list to [-70, 20, 9, 1, 1].
- The function then returns this modified list.

<<<Output>>>
[-70, 20, 9, 1, 1]
