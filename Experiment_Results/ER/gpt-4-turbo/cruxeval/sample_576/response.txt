<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes two parameters: `array` and `const`. It initializes a list `output` with a single element 'x'. The function then iterates over the range from 1 to the length of `array` plus 1. For each index `i`:
- If `i` is odd, it appends the element at position `i-1` of `array` multiplied by -2 to `output`.
- If `i` is even, it appends the value of `const` to `output`.

For the input `f([1, 2, 3], -1)`:
- The `array` is `[1, 2, 3]` and `const` is `-1`.
- The length of `array` is 3, so the loop runs for `i` values 1, 2, and 3.
  - For `i = 1` (odd), it appends `-2 * array[0]` which is `-2 * 1 = -2`.
  - For `i = 2` (even), it appends `const` which is `-1`.
  - For `i = 3` (odd), it appends `-2 * array[2]` which is `-2 * 3 = -6`.
- The final `output` list becomes `['x', -2, -1, -6]`.

['x', -2, -1, -6]
