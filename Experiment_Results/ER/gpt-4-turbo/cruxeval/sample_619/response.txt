<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string 'title' as input and returns the lowercase version of that string using the method .lower(). The input string '   Rock   Paper   SCISSORS  ' includes leading, trailing, and multiple spaces between the words, along with mixed case letters. The .lower() method converts all uppercase letters in the string to lowercase but does not alter the spaces or any other non-alphabetic characters.

<<<Output>>>
