<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes two parameters: `text` and `char`. It checks if `char` is present in `text`. If `char` is found, it splits `text` by `char`, resulting in a list of substrings. Each substring is then stripped of leading and trailing whitespace using a list comprehension. The list comprehension also filters out any empty strings.

For the input `f('only one line', ' ')`, the function checks if the space character `' '` is in the string `'only one line'`. Since spaces are present, the string is split into the list `['only', 'one', 'line']`. Each of these substrings is already stripped of whitespace, and none are empty, so the list remains `['only', 'one', 'line']`.

Next, the function checks if the length of the resulting list is greater than 1. In this case, the list has three elements, so the length is indeed greater than 1.

Since the condition is met, the function returns `True`.
