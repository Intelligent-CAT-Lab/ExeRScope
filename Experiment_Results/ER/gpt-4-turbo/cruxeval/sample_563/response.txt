<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two strings, text1 and text2, as input. It initializes an empty list called nums. Then, it iterates over each character in text2. For each character, it counts how many times that character appears in text1 and appends this count to the nums list. Finally, the function returns the sum of all counts stored in nums.

For the input text1 = 'jivespdcxc' and text2 = 'sx':
1. Initialize nums = [].
2. Iterate over each character in text2:
   - For 's': count of 's' in text1 is 1. Append 1 to nums. Now nums = [1].
   - For 'x': count of 'x' in text1 is 2. Append 2 to nums. Now nums = [1, 2].
3. Sum the values in nums: 1 + 2 = 3.
4. Return the sum, which is 3.
