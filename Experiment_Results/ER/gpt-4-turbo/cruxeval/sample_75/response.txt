<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two parameters: an array and an element (elem). It first finds the index of the element in the array using the index() method. This index is stored in the variable 'ind'. The function then calculates the result by multiplying this index by 2 and adding the product of 3 times the element at the position calculated as '-ind - 1' from the end of the array.

For the given input array `[-1, 2, 1, -8, 2]` and element `2`:
1. The index() method finds the first occurrence of `2`, which is at index 1.
2. The calculation for the output is then:
   - ind = 1
   - ind * 2 = 2
   - The element at position `[-ind - 1]` from the end is `[-1 - 1] = [-2]`, which corresponds to the element `-8` in the array.
   - -8 * 3 = -24
   - Final result = 2 + (-24) = -22

<<<Output>>>
-22
