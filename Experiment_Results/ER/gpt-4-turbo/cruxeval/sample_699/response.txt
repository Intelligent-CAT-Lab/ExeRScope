<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two parameters, text and elem. It checks if elem is not an empty string. If elem is not empty, it performs two while loops:
1. The first while loop checks if the string text starts with the string elem. If true, it replaces occurrences of elem in text with an empty string. This loop continues as long as text starts with elem.
2. The second while loop checks if elem starts with text. If true, it replaces occurrences of text in elem with an empty string. This loop continues as long as elem starts with text.

In the given input, text is "some" and elem is "1". Since "some" does not start with "1", the first while loop does not execute. Similarly, "1" does not start with "some", so the second while loop also does not execute. Therefore, neither text nor elem is modified.

Finally, the function returns a list containing elem and text in their original forms.

<<<Output>>>
['1', 'some']
