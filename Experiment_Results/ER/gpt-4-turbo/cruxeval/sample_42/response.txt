<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of numbers as input. The first operation inside the function is `nums.clear()`, which removes all elements from the list, making it an empty list. After clearing the list, the function enters a for loop that iterates over the elements of the now empty list. Since the list is empty, the loop does not execute any iterations, and no elements are added to the list. Therefore, the list remains empty throughout the execution of the function. The function then returns the empty list as the output.
