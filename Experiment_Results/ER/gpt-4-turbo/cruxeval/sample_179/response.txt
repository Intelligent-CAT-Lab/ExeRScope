The function `f` takes a list `nums` as input and operates on a copy of this list to avoid modifying the original list. The function calculates the length of the list `nums` and stores it in the variable `count`. The loop iterates from `-count+1` to `0`, which effectively iterates from the second last element to the first element of the list in reverse order.

For the input list `[7, 1, 2, 6, 0, 2]`, the `count` is 6. The loop will run from `-5` to `0`. Here's the breakdown of the loop iterations:
- `i = -5`: `nums[1]` is `1`, so `1` is inserted at the beginning of the list.
- `i = -4`: `nums[2]` is `2`, so `2` is inserted at the beginning of the list.
- `i = -3`: `nums[3]` is `6`, so `6` is inserted at the beginning of the list.
- `i = -2`: `nums[4]` is `0`, so `0` is inserted at the beginning of the list.
- `i = -1`: `nums[5]` is `2`, so `2` is inserted at the beginning of the list.

After all iterations, the list becomes `[2, 0, 6, 2, 1, 7, 1, 2, 6, 0, 2]`. This list is then returned by the function.

[2, 0, 6, 2, 1, 7, 1, 2, 6, 0, 2]
