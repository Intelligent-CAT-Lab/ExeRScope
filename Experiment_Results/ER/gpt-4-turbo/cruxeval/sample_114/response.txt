<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two parameters: a string 'text' and a string 'sep'. It returns the result of splitting the 'text' string using the 'sep' string as a separator, splitting from the right and limiting the number of splits to 2.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the inputs "a-.-.b" and "-.", we need to perform a right split on "a-.-.b" using "-." as the separator, with a maximum of 2 splits. The string "a-.-.b" contains "-." twice. When we split from the right, the first split separates "b" from "a-.-", and the second split is not possible as there are no more "-." to the left of "a-.-". Thus, the output will be the list containing the parts ["a", "b"].

<<<Output>>>
['a', 'b']
