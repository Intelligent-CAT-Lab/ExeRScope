<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two parameters: a list called nums and an integer p. The function calculates a new index, prev_p, by subtracting 1 from p. If prev_p is less than 0, it is adjusted to point to the last element of the list by setting it to len(nums) - 1. The function then returns the element of nums at the index prev_p.

For the given input nums = [6, 8, 2, 5, 3, 1, 9, 7] and p = 6:
1. Calculate prev_p = p - 1 = 6 - 1 = 5.
2. Check if prev_p < 0. In this case, prev_p = 5, which is not less than 0, so no adjustment is needed.
3. Return the element at index 5 of the list nums. nums[5] = 1.

Therefore, the function returns the value 1.
