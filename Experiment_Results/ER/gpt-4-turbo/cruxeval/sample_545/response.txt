The function `f` takes a list `array` as input and initializes an empty list `result` and a variable `index` set to 0. It then enters a while loop that continues as long as `index` is less than the length of `array`.

Inside the loop, the function appends the last element of `array` (using `array.pop()`, which also removes that element from `array`) to `result`. Then, it increments `index` by 2. This means that the loop will run fewer times than the length of the original array because `index` is increased by 2 in each iteration, but the length of `array` is reduced by 1 in each iteration due to the `pop()` operation.

Let's analyze the execution step by step for the input `[8, 8, -4, -9, 2, 8, -1, 8]`:
1. Initial state: `array = [8, 8, -4, -9, 2, 8, -1, 8]`, `result = []`, `index = 0`
2. First iteration: `pop()` removes 8, `result = [8]`, `array = [8, 8, -4, -9, 2, 8, -1]`, `index = 2`
3. Second iteration: `pop()` removes -1, `result = [8, -1]`, `array = [8, 8, -4, -9, 2, 8]`, `index = 4`
4. Third iteration: `pop()` removes 8, `result = [8, -1, 8]`, `array = [8, 8, -4, -9, 2]`, `index = 6`
5. Fourth iteration: `pop()` removes 2, `result = [8, -1, 8, 2]`, `array = [8, 8, -4, -9]`, `index = 8`

At this point, the loop exits because `index` (8) is not less than the length of `array` (4).

Therefore, the final result is `[8, -1, 8, 2]`.
