<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list list_x as input. It first calculates the length of the list and stores it in item_count. Then, it initializes an empty list new_list. The function then enters a loop that iterates item_count times. In each iteration, it removes the last element from list_x using the pop() method and appends this element to new_list. Since pop() removes elements from the end of the list, the elements are appended to new_list in reverse order of their original positions in list_x. After the loop completes, all elements from list_x have been moved to new_list in reverse order, and list_x becomes empty. The function returns new_list.

For the input [5, 8, 6, 8, 4]:
- item_count is 5 (length of the list).
- new_list starts as an empty list [].
- In the first iteration, pop() removes 4 from list_x and appends it to new_list, making new_list [4].
- In the second iteration, pop() removes 8 from list_x and appends it to new_list, making new_list [4, 8].
- In the third iteration, pop() removes 6 from list_x and appends it to new_list, making new_list [4, 8, 6].
- In the fourth iteration, pop() removes 8 from list_x and appends it to new_list, making new_list [4, 8, 6, 8].
- In the fifth iteration, pop() removes 5 from list_x and appends it to new_list, making new_list [4, 8, 6, 8, 5].
- list_x is now empty, and new_list contains [4, 8, 6, 8, 5].

The function returns the new_list [4, 8, 6, 8, 5], which is the reverse of the original list.

<<<Output>>>
[4, 8, 6, 8, 5]
