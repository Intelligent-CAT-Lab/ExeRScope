<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes an integer num as input. It first checks if num is even by using the condition num % 2 == 0. If num is even, it returns the string s, which is defined outside the function as '<' repeated 10 times. If num is not even (i.e., it is odd), the function returns num - 1.

In this case, the input to the function f is 21, which is an odd number. Therefore, the condition num % 2 == 0 evaluates to False. As a result, the function will execute the else block, which returns num - 1.

Calculating 21 - 1 gives 20. Hence, the output of the function f when called with the argument 21 is 20.
