<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a dictionary d as input and initializes an empty list called keys. It then iterates over each key in the dictionary. For each key, it appends a string to the keys list, which is formatted as 'key => value', where key and value are the current key and its corresponding value in the dictionary. The function finally returns the list keys.

For the input dictionary {'-4':'4','1':'2','-':'-3'}:
1. The function starts with an empty list: keys = []
2. It iterates over the keys of the dictionary. The order of keys in a dictionary is the order they were inserted, so the iteration order will be '-4', '1', '-'.
3. For key '-4', it appends '-4 => 4' to the keys list.
4. For key '1', it appends '1 => 2' to the keys list.
5. For key '-', it appends '- => -3' to the keys list.
6. The final list is ['-4 => 4', '1 => 2', '- => -3'].

The function returns this list.
<<<Output>>>
['-4 => 4', '1 => 2', '- => -3']
