<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two parameters, k and j. It initializes an empty list named arr. Then, it iterates from 0 to k-1 (inclusive), appending the value of j to the list arr in each iteration. In this specific call, f(7, 5), the loop will run 7 times since k is 7. Each time, it appends the value 5 to the list arr. Therefore, after completing the loop, the list arr will contain the value 5 repeated 7 times.
<<<Output>>>
[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]
