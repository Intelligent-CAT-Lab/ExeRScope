<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string st as input. It first converts the string to lowercase using st.lower(). Then, it checks the positions of the last occurrences of 'h' and 'i' using rindex. The condition in the if statement checks if the last occurrence of 'h' (after the last occurrence of 'i') is greater than or equal to the last occurrence of 'i'. If true, it returns 'Hey', otherwise 'Hi'.

For the input 'Hi there':
1. Convert 'Hi there' to lowercase: 'hi there'
2. Find the last occurrence of 'i': it is at index 1.
3. Find the last occurrence of 'h' after the last 'i': it is at index 4.
4. Check if index of 'h' (4) is greater than or equal to index of 'i' (1): True

Since the condition is true, the function returns 'Hey'.
<<<Output>>>
'Hey'
