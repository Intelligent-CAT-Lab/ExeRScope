<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string 'text' as input and initializes a variable 'ws' to 0, which is used to count whitespace characters in the string. The function then iterates over each character 's' in the string 'text'. For each character, it checks if the character is a whitespace using the 'isspace()' method. If 's' is a whitespace, it increments the 'ws' counter by 1. After finishing the loop, the function returns a tuple containing two values: the count of whitespace characters ('ws') and the total length of the string ('len(text)').

For the input "jcle oq wsnibktxpiozyxmopqkfnrfjds", the function will iterate over each character. There is only one whitespace character in the string (between "jcle" and "oq"). Therefore, 'ws' will be incremented once. The total length of the string is 34 characters.

<<<Output>>>
(1, 34)
