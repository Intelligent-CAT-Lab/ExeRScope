<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes two parameters, `strand` and `zmnc`. It initializes `poz` by finding the index of the substring `zmnc` in `strand`. The function then enters a while loop that continues as long as `poz` is not -1 (indicating that `zmnc` is found in `strand`). Inside the loop, `strand` is updated to be the substring starting from the character after the found position of `zmnc`, and `poz` is updated to the new position of `zmnc` in the updated `strand`. This process removes the part of `strand` up to and including the first occurrence of `zmnc` repeatedly until `zmnc` is no longer found. After exiting the loop, the function returns the result of `strand.rfind(zmnc)`, which searches for the last occurrence of `zmnc` in the modified `strand`.

For the input `f('', 'abc')`, the initial value of `strand` is an empty string. The `find` method will return -1 immediately since `zmnc` ('abc') cannot be found in an empty string. The while loop will not execute because `poz` is -1. Finally, `strand.rfind(zmnc)` is called, which will also return -1 because `zmnc` is not present in the empty `strand`.

<<<Output>>>
-1
