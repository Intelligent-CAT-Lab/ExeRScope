<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string 'text' as input and initializes an empty list 'ans'. It then iterates over each character in the input string. If the character is a digit (using the isdigit() method), it appends the character to the list 'ans'. If the character is not a digit, it appends a space ' ' to the list 'ans'. After iterating through all characters, it joins all elements of the list 'ans' into a single string and returns this string.

For the input 'm4n2o':
1. 'm' is not a digit, so a space ' ' is appended to 'ans'.
2. '4' is a digit, so '4' is appended to 'ans'.
3. 'n' is not a digit, so a space ' ' is appended to 'ans'.
4. '2' is a digit, so '2' is appended to 'ans'.
5. 'o' is not a digit, so a space ' ' is appended to 'ans'.

The list 'ans' now contains [' ', '4', ' ', '2', ' ']. Joining these elements results in the string " 4 2 ".
<<<Output>>>
' 4 2 '
