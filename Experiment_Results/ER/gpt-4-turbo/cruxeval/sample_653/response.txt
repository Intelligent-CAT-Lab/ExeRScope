<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two parameters: a string `text` and a string `letter`. It initializes a variable `t` with the value of `text`. Then, it iterates over each character `alph` in `text` and replaces all occurrences of `alph` in `t` with an empty string. This means that after the loop, `t` will be an empty string because every character in `text` has been removed. The function then returns the length of the list obtained by splitting `t` on `letter`. Since `t` is an empty string, splitting it on any character, including "c", will result in a list containing one empty string. Therefore, the length of this list is 1.
