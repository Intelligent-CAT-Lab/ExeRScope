<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes a list `nums` as input. The function first calculates the length of the list and stores it in the variable `count`. In this case, `count` will be 3 since the list has three elements: [0, -5, -4].

The function then enters a for loop that iterates from the last index of the list to the first index (from 2 to 0 in this case). During each iteration, the function performs two operations:
1. `nums.pop(0)`: This removes and returns the first element of the list.
2. `nums.insert(i, ...)`: This inserts the element returned by `pop(0)` at the index `i`.

Let's analyze the operations step by step:
- Initial list: [0, -5, -4]
- i = 2: pop(0) removes 0, list becomes [-5, -4], then insert(2, 0) results in [-5, -4, 0].
- i = 1: pop(0) removes -5, list becomes [-4, 0], then insert(1, -5) results in [-4, -5, 0].
- i = 0: pop(0) removes -4, list becomes [-5, 0], then insert(0, -4) results in [-4, -5, 0].

After the loop completes, the list is [-4, -5, 0]. This is the final state of the list, which is then returned by the function.

<<<Output>>>
[-4, -5, 0]
