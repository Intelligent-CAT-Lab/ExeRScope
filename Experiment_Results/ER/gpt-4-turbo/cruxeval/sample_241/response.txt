<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string called postcode as input. It uses the method index() to find the first occurrence of the character 'C' in the string. The slicing operation postcode[postcode.index('C'):] then returns the substring of postcode starting from the character 'C' to the end of the string.
For the input 'ED20 CW', the index of 'C' is 5. Therefore, the slicing operation starts from index 5 and goes to the end of the string, which results in the substring "CW".

<<<Output>>>
'CW'
