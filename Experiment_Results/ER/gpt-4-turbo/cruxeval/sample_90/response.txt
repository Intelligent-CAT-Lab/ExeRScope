<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of lists (array) as input and initializes an empty list called return_arr. It then iterates over each element (which are lists themselves) in the input array. For each element, it appends a copy of the list to return_arr using the list's copy() method. This method ensures that a shallow copy of the list is created, meaning modifications to the original lists in the input array will not affect the lists in return_arr.

For the input `[[1, 2, 3], [], [1, 2, 3]]`, the function performs the following steps:
1. Initializes return_arr to an empty list.
2. Iterates over the first element `[1, 2, 3]` and appends a copy of it to return_arr.
3. Iterates over the second element `[]` (an empty list) and appends a copy of it to return_arr.
4. Iterates over the third element `[1, 2, 3]` and appends a copy of it to return_arr.

After processing all elements, return_arr contains `[[1, 2, 3], [], [1, 2, 3]]`, which are copies of the original sublists.

<<<Output>>>
[[1, 2, 3], [], [1, 2, 3]]
