<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes a list `array` as input and initializes an empty list `result`. It then iterates over each element `elem` in the input list. For each element, it checks two conditions:
1. If the element is an ASCII character (`elem.isascii()`).
2. If the element is an integer and the absolute value of the integer converted to a string is not an ASCII string (`isinstance(elem, int) and not str(abs(elem)).isascii()`).

If either of these conditions is true, the element is appended to the `result` list.

In the given input `["a", "b", "c"]`:
- Each element ("a", "b", "c") is a string and an ASCII character.
- Therefore, each element satisfies the first condition (`elem.isascii()`).
- As a result, each element is appended to the `result` list.

Finally, the function returns the `result` list, which contains all the elements of the input list since they all are ASCII characters.

<<<Output>>>
['a', 'b', 'c']
