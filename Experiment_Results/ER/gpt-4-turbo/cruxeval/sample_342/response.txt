<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string 'text' as input and returns a boolean value. It checks if the number of hyphens ('-') in the string is equal to the length of the string. This is done using the count method to count the hyphens and comparing it with the total length of the string using the len function.

For the input "---123-4":
1. The count of '-' in "---123-4" is 4.
2. The length of the string "---123-4" is 8.
3. The function checks if 4 (count of '-') equals 8 (length of the string), which is false.

Therefore, the function will return False for this input.
<<<Output>>>
False
