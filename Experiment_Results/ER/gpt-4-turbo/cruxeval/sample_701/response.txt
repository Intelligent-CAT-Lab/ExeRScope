<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes two parameters: a string `stg` and a tuple `tabs` containing characters. The function iterates over each character in `tabs` and removes these characters from the right end of the string `stg` using the `rstrip()` method. The `rstrip()` method removes all combinations of the specified characters from the right end of the string until it encounters a character not in `tabs`.

For the input `stg = '31849 let it!31849 pass!'` and `tabs = ('3','1','8',' ','1','9','2','d')`, the function will process as follows:
1. The initial string is `'31849 let it!31849 pass!'`.
2. The `rstrip()` method will remove the characters '3', '1', '8', ' ', '1', '9', '2', 'd' from the right end of the string.
3. The characters '!', 's', 's', 'a', 'p', ' ', '9', '4', '8', '1', '3' are sequentially checked from the right end. The characters 's', 's', 'a', 'p', ' ', '9', '4', '8', '1', '3' are removed because they are in `tabs`.
4. The process stops when it encounters the character '!' which is not in `tabs`.

The final string after processing will be `'31849 let it!'`.

<<<Output>>>
'31849 let it!'
