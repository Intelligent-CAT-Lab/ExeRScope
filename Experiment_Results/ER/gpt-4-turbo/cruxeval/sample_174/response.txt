<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list lst as input. It modifies the sublist from index 1 to 3 (inclusive of index 1 but exclusive of index 4) by reversing it. The steps are as follows:
1. The input list is [1, 2, 3].
2. The sublist lst[1:4] includes elements from index 1 to index 2 (since index 3 is out of range for this list), which are [2, 3].
3. This sublist [2, 3] is reversed to [3, 2].
4. The reversed sublist [3, 2] replaces the original elements at indices 1 and 2 in the list, resulting in the list [1, 3, 2].
5. The function returns the modified list [1, 3, 2].

<<<Output>>>
[1, 3, 2]
