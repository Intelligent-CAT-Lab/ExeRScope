<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two parameters: a string 'text' and an integer 'position'. It performs the following steps:
1. Calculate the length of the input string 'text', which is 7 for 'undbs l'.
2. Compute the index by taking the modulus of 'position' with 'length + 1'. Here, position is 1 and length + 1 is 8, so index = 1 % 8 = 1.
3. Check if 'position' or 'index' is negative. If either is negative, set 'index' to -1. In this case, both are positive, so 'index' remains 1.
4. Convert the string 'text' into a list of characters for manipulation.
5. Remove the character at the calculated 'index' from the list. The character at index 1 in 'undbs l' is 'n'.
6. Join the modified list of characters back into a string.

After removing the character at index 1 ('n') from 'undbs l', the remaining characters are 'udbs l'.
<<<Output>>>
'udbs l'
