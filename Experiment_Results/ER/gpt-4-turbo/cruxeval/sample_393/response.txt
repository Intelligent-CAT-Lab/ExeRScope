The function f takes a string 'text' as input. Here's the step-by-step breakdown of the function with the input 'scala':

1. The string 'text' is reversed, resulting in 'alacs'.
2. An empty string 'text2' is initialized.
3. A for loop iterates from the length of the reversed string minus 3 to 0, with a step of -3. In this case, the length of 'alacs' is 5, so the loop starts at 5 - 3 = 2 and goes to 0.
4. Inside the loop, the substring from index i to i+3 of 'alacs' is taken and joined with '---', then added to 'text2' with an additional '---' at the end.
5. The loop runs only once because of the range and step:
   - In the first iteration, i = 2, so 'alacs'[2:2+3] = 'acs'. This is joined with '---' to form 'a---c---s', and '---' is added at the end, resulting in 'a---c---s---'.
6. After the loop, the last three characters ('---') are removed from 'text2'.
7. The final value of 'text2' is 'a---c---s'.

Therefore, the function returns 'a---c---s' when called with the input 'scala'.
