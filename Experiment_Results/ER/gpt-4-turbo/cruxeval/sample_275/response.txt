<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a dictionary `dic` as input. Inside the function, a new dictionary `dic2` is created using the `zip` function, which pairs the values of the original dictionary `dic` with its keys. This effectively swaps the keys and values of the dictionary.

For the input dictionary `{-1: "a", 0: "b", 1: "c"}`, the keys are -1, 0, and 1, and the values are "a", "b", and "c". When we use the `zip` function to pair the values with the keys, we get pairs ("a", -1), ("b", 0), and ("c", 1). These pairs are then used to create the new dictionary `dic2`.

Therefore, the output of the function f when called with the dictionary `{-1: "a", 0: "b", 1: "c"}` will be a dictionary where the keys are the original values and the values are the original keys, resulting in `{"a": -1, "b": 0, "c": 1}`.
<<<Output>>>
{'a': -1, 'b': 0, 'c': 1}
