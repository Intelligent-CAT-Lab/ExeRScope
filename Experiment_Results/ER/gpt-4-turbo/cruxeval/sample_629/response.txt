<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes two parameters: `text` and `dng`. It checks if `dng` is not in `text`, and if so, returns `text`. If `dng` is at the end of `text`, it returns `text` without the `dng` part. If neither condition is met, it removes the last character from `text` and recursively calls `f` with the new `text` (minus the last two characters) and `dng`.

For the input `f('catNG', 'NG')`:
1. The function checks if 'NG' is not in 'catNG'. This is false since 'NG' is in 'catNG'.
2. It then checks if 'catNG' ends with 'NG'. This is true.
3. Since the second condition is true, the function returns 'catNG' without the 'NG', which is 'cat'.

<<<Output>>>
'cat'
