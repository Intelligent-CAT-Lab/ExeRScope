<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes a string `multi_string` as input. The function first splits the input string into words using `multi_string.split()`, which results in a list of words. Then, it uses the `map` function with `str.isascii` to check if each word consists only of ASCII characters, resulting in an iterable of boolean values.

The function then checks if there is any `True` value in the iterable `cond_string`. If there is at least one `True`, it means there is at least one word in the input string that consists only of ASCII characters. In this case, the function returns a string that joins all words that are ASCII-only, separated by commas.

For the input 'I am hungry! eat food.', the `split()` method will break it down into the list `['I', 'am', 'hungry!', 'eat', 'food.']`. The `map(str.isascii, ...)` will evaluate to `[True, True, False, True, False]` because 'hungry!' and 'food.' contain non-ASCII characters ('!' and '.'). Since there are `True` values in the list, the function will filter and join the words that are purely ASCII, which are 'I', 'am', and 'eat'.

Therefore, the output will be the string 'I, am, eat'.
