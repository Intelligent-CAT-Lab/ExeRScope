<<<Analysis>>>
The function f is designed to reverse a given string. It initializes an empty string `result` and iterates over the input string `text` from the last character to the first. In each iteration, it appends the current character to `result`. 

For the input 'was,', the function processes as follows:
- Starts with `i = 3` (index of ','), `result` becomes ','
- Next, `i = 2` (index of 's'), `result` becomes ',s'
- Then, `i = 1` (index of 'a'), `result` becomes ',sa'
- Finally, `i = 0` (index of 'w'), `result` becomes ',saw'

Thus, the function reverses the string 'was,' to ',saw'.
<<<Output>>>
',saw'
