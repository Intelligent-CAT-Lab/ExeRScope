<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two parameters: 'text' and 'char'. It returns True if both 'char' and 'text' are lowercase strings, otherwise it returns False. 
To determine the output of executing the function f on the inputs 'abc' and 'e':
1. Check if 'char' ('e') is lowercase. Since 'e' is a lowercase letter, this condition is True.
2. Check if 'text' ('abc') is lowercase. Since 'abc' is a lowercase string, this condition is also True.
Since both conditions are True, the function returns True.

<<<Output>>>
True
