<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two parameters: a string 'text' and a string 'digit'. The function counts the number of times the string 'digit' appears in 'text' using the count method. It then converts the string 'digit' to an integer and multiplies it by the count obtained.

For the input 'text' as '7Ljnw4Lj' and 'digit' as '7':
1. The count of '7' in '7Ljnw4Lj' is 1.
2. Convert '7' to an integer, which is 7.
3. Multiply the integer value 7 by the count, which is 1.

Therefore, the result of the function f for the given input is 7 * 1 = 7.
<<<Output>>>
7
