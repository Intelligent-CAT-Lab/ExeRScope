<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes two parameters: an integer `n` and a list `array`. It initializes a list `final` containing a single element, which is a copy of `array`. The function then enters a loop that iterates `n` times.

In each iteration:
1. A copy of `array` is created and stored in `arr`.
2. The last element of `final` (which is a list) is extended by appending the elements of `arr` to it.
3. This newly formed list `arr` is then appended to `final`.

For the specific input `f(1, [1, 2, 3])`:
- `n` is 1, and `array` is `[1, 2, 3]`.
- Initially, `final` is `[[1, 2, 3]]`.
- In the first (and only) iteration:
  - `arr` is a copy of `array`, so `arr` is `[1, 2, 3]`.
  - `final[-1]` is `[1, 2, 3]`. `arr` extends `final[-1]`, resulting in `arr` becoming `[1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]`.
  - This `arr` is appended to `final`, making `final` now `[[1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]]`.

Thus, the final output after one iteration with the input list `[1, 2, 3]` is `[[1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]]`.
