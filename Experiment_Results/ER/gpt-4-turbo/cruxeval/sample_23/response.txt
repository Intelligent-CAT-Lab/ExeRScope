<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes two parameters: `text` and `chars`. It processes the input text by stripping characters from the end of the string based on the `chars` string provided. If `chars` is not empty, it strips the characters specified in `chars` from the end of `text`. If `chars` is empty, it defaults to stripping whitespace from the end.

In this specific call `f('new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.2', '0123456789-')`, the `chars` string is '0123456789-', which means the function will strip any of these characters from the end of the `text`.

Breaking down the input text 'new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.2':
- The last part of the string '2.2' contains '2' which is in the `chars` string.
- The function will strip '2.2' from the end because '2' and '.' (though '.' is not in `chars`, it is between the '2's which are in `chars`).
- The next character from the end after '2.2' is a space, which is not in `chars`, so the stripping stops there.

After stripping, the remaining text is 'new-medium-performing-application - XQuery '.

The function then checks if the resulting text is empty. If it were empty, it would return '-', but in this case, it is not.

Therefore, the function returns the stripped text.
