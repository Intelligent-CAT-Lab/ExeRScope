<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list called array as input. The function performs the following steps:
1. It removes the last element from the array using the pop() method and stores it in the variable n. For the input [1, 1, 2, 2], n will be 2 after this operation, and the array will become [1, 1, 2].
2. It then extends the array by adding two elements, both of which are the value stored in n. This means the array will be extended by [2, 2].
3. Finally, the function returns the modified array.

For the given input [1, 1, 2, 2], after popping the last element, the array becomes [1, 1, 2]. Extending this array with [2, 2] results in [1, 1, 2, 2, 2]. Therefore, the output of the function f with the input [1, 1, 2, 2] is [1, 1, 2, 2, 2].
<<<Output>>>
[1, 1, 2, 2, 2]
