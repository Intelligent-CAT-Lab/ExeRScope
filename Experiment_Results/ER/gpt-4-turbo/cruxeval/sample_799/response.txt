<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes a string `st` as input. It first checks if the first character of `st` is '~'. If it is, it right-justifies the string `st` to a length of 10 characters, padding with 's' on the left, and then recursively calls `f` with this new string. If the first character is not '~', it right-justifies the string `st` to a length of 10 characters, padding with 'n' on the left, and returns this new string.

For the input 'eqe-;ew22':
1. The first character of 'eqe-;ew22' is 'e', not '~'.
2. Therefore, the function will right-justify 'eqe-;ew22' to a length of 10 characters, padding with 'n' on the left.
3. The length of 'eqe-;ew22' is already 10 characters, so no padding is needed, and the string remains unchanged.

Thus, the function returns 'eqe-;ew22'.
<<<Output>>>
'eqe-;ew22'
