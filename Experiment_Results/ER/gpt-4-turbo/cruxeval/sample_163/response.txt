<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three parameters: text, space_symbol, and size. It aims to return a string that consists of the original text followed by enough repetitions of space_symbol to make the total length equal to size.

1. The input parameters are text='w', space_symbol='))', and size=7.
2. The function first calculates the number of space_symbols needed to reach the total length of size. This is done by subtracting the length of the text from size: size - len(text) = 7 - 1 = 6.
3. The function then generates a string of space_symbols repeated enough times to fill the gap. This is achieved using a generator expression inside the join method. The expression 'space_symbol for i in range(6)' will repeat '))' six times.
4. The resulting string of space_symbols is '))))))))', which is the concatenation of '))' six times.
5. Finally, the function concatenates the original text 'w' with the generated string of space_symbols, resulting in 'w))))))))'.

<<<Output>>>
'w))))))))'
