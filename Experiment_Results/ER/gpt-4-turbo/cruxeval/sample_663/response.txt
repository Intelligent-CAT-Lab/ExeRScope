<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes two parameters: `container` and `cron`. It checks if `cron` is not in `container`. If `cron` is not found in `container`, the function returns `container` as it is.

In this specific call `f([], 2)`, the `container` is an empty list `[]`, and `cron` is the integer `2`. Since the list is empty, it does not contain the integer `2` or any other elements.

Therefore, the condition `if not cron in container` evaluates to `True` because `2` is indeed not in the empty list `[]`. As a result, the function will return the `container` as it is, which is an empty list.
