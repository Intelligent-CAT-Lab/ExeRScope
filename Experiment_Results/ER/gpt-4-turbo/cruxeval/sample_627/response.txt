<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of tuples called 'parts' as input. Each tuple consists of two elements, where the first element is a key and the second is a value. The function converts this list of tuples into a dictionary using the dict() constructor, which inherently removes any duplicate keys, keeping only the last occurrence of each key. After converting to a dictionary, the function returns a list of the values from this dictionary.

In the given input [('u', 1), ('s', 7), ('u', -5)], the tuple ('u', 1) initially sets the key 'u' to 1. However, the tuple ('u', -5) later updates the key 'u' to -5. The key 's' is set to 7. Therefore, the dictionary formed is {'u': -5, 's': 7}. The values of this dictionary are [-5, 7], which are then returned as a list.

<<<Output>>>
[-5, 7]
