<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string 'tokens' as input. The steps executed by the function are as follows:
1. The input string 'tokens' is split into a list of words using the split() method. For the input 'gsd avdropj', this results in the list ['gsd', 'avdropj'].
2. The function then checks if the length of the list is exactly 2. In this case, it is, so the list is reversed. The list becomes ['avdropj', 'gsd'].
3. The function then joins the elements of the list into a single string, but before joining, it ensures each element is left-justified to a width of 5 characters using the ljust(5) method. The word 'avdropj' remains 'avdropj' as it is longer than 5 characters, and 'gsd' becomes 'gsd  ' (with two spaces added to make it 5 characters long).
4. These formatted strings are then joined with a space between them to form the final result.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'gsd avdropj' is 'avdropj gsd  '.

'avdropj gsd  '
