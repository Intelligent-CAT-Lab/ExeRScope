<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input. The steps executed in the function are as follows:
1. The string s is stripped of leading and trailing whitespace using the strip() method. In this case, the input string '   OOP   ' becomes 'OOP'.
2. The stripped string 'OOP' is then converted into a list of characters: ['O', 'O', 'P'].
3. This list is reversed, resulting in ['P', 'O', 'O'].
4. Finally, the reversed list is joined back into a string using the join() method, resulting in 'POO'.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input '   OOP   ' is 'POO'.
<<<Output>>>
'POO'
