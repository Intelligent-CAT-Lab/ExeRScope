<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list arr as input and returns a new list that is the reverse of arr. The function uses the built-in Python function reversed(), which returns an iterator that accesses the given sequence in the reverse order. The list() function then converts this iterator into a list.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [2, 0, 1, 9999, 3, -5], we need to reverse the order of the elements in the list. The first element becomes the last, the second element becomes the second to last, and so on, until the last element becomes the first.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [2, 0, 1, 9999, 3, -5] is [-5, 3, 9999, 1, 0, 2].
<<<Output>>>
[-5, 3, 9999, 1, 0, 2]
