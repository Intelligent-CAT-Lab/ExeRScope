<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes a list `lst` as input and initializes two variables: `i` set to 0 and `new_list` as an empty list. The function then enters a while loop that continues as long as `i` is less than the length of `lst`.

Inside the loop, the function checks if the current element `lst[i]` appears later in the list (`lst[i+1:]`). If it does, the element is appended to `new_list`. If at any point the length of `new_list` reaches 3, the function immediately returns `new_list`.

The loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration.

For the input `[0, 2, 1, 2, 6, 2, 6, 3, 0]`:
- At `i = 0`, `lst[0]` is 0, which appears later in the list. So, 0 is added to `new_list`.
- At `i = 1`, `lst[1]` is 2, which appears later in the list. So, 2 is added to `new_list`.
- At `i = 2`, `lst[2]` is 1, which does not appear later in the list.
- At `i = 3`, `lst[3]` is 2, which appears later in the list. So, 2 is added to `new_list` again.
- At this point, `new_list` has three elements `[0, 2, 2]`, and the function returns this list.
