<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes a dictionary `data` as input. The keys of the dictionary represent some identifiers, and the values are lists of members associated with these identifiers.

1. The function initializes an empty list `members`.
2. It iterates over each key in the dictionary `data`.
3. For each key, it iterates over the list of members in `data[key]`.
4. For each member in the list, it checks if the member is not already in the `members` list. If the member is not in the list, it appends the member to the `members` list.
5. After iterating through all keys and their corresponding lists, the function returns the `members` list sorted in alphabetical order.

For the input `{'inf': ['a', 'b'], 'a': ["inf", "c"], 'd': ["inf"]}`:
- The first key 'inf' has the members ['a', 'b']. Both 'a' and 'b' are added to the `members` list.
- The next key 'a' has the members ["inf", "c"]. 'inf' is not in the `members` list, so it is added. 'c' is also not in the list, so it is added.
- The last key 'd' has the member ["inf"]. 'inf' is already in the `members` list, so it is not added again.
- The final `members` list before sorting is ['a', 'b', 'inf', 'c'].
- The sorted list is ['a', 'b', 'c', 'inf'].

<<<Output>>>
['a', 'b', 'c', 'inf']
