<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a dictionary d as input. Inside the function, the first operation is to create a copy of the input dictionary to ensure that the original dictionary is not modified. This is done using the `d.copy()` method. The copied dictionary is then assigned back to the variable d.

Next, the `popitem()` method is called on the dictionary d. The `popitem()` method removes and returns the last (key, value) pair from the dictionary. Since dictionaries in Python 3.7 and later maintain insertion order, the last item in the dictionary {"l": 1, "t": 2, "x:": 3} is ("x:", 3), which will be removed.

After the `popitem()` operation, the dictionary d will have the items {"l": 1, "t": 2} remaining.

Finally, the function returns the modified dictionary d, which now contains only the items {"l": 1, "t": 2}.

<<<Output>>>
{'l': 1, 't': 2}
