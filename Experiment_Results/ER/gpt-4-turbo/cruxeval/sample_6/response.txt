The function `f` takes a dictionary `dic` as input. It iterates over the dictionary items sorted by the length of their string representation. The sorting is done using a lambda function `key=lambda x: len(str(x))`, where `x` is each key-value pair tuple from the dictionary. The sorted items are then processed in a loop where all but the last item are removed from the dictionary using `dic.pop(k)`.

Let's break down the input dictionary `{'11': 52, '65': 34, 'a': 12, '4': 52, '74': 31}`:
1. Convert each item to a string to apply the sorting key:
   - '11': 52 -> "('11', 52)" with length 9
   - '65': 34 -> "('65', 34)" with length 9
   - 'a': 12 -> "('a', 12)" with length 8
   - '4': 52 -> "('4', 52)" with length 8
   - '74': 31 -> "('74', 31)" with length 9

2. Sort these based on length:
   - "('a', 12)" and "('4', 52)" both have length 8
   - "('11', 52)", "('65', 34)", and "('74', 31)" all have length 9

3. The sorted order (by length and then lexicographically by default) would be:
   - "('4', 52)", "('a', 12)", "('11', 52)", "('65', 34)", "('74', 31)"

4. The loop removes all but the last item from the dictionary:
   - Remove '4', 'a', '11', '65'

5. The remaining dictionary has one item:
   - {'74': 31}

6. The function returns the list of items of the remaining dictionary.
