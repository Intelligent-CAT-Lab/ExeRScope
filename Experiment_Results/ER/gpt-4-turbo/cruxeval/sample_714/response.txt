<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list called array as input and performs several operations on it:
1. `array.reverse()` reverses the order of the elements in the list. For the input [3, -2, 0], after this operation, the list becomes [0, -2, 3].
2. `array.clear()` removes all elements from the list, making it an empty list [].
3. `array.extend('x'*len(array))` extends the list by adding elements. The expression 'x'*len(array) creates a string of 'x' characters repeated as many times as the length of the array. Since the array is now empty (length is 0), 'x'*0 results in an empty string, and thus no elements are added to the array.
4. `array.reverse()` is called again, but since the array is still empty, it remains unchanged.
5. Finally, the function returns the array, which is still empty.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [3, -2, 0] is an empty list.
