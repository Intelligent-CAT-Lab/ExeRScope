The function f takes a list `arr` as input. It first calculates the length of the list and stores it in the variable `count`. It then creates a copy of the list `arr` and stores it in the variable `sub`. The function then iterates over the indices of the list `sub` in steps of 2 (i.e., it processes every second element starting from index 0). During each iteration, it multiplies the element at the current index by 5. Finally, the function returns the modified list `sub`.

For the input `[-3, -6, 2, 7]`:
- `count` is 4 (since there are four elements in the list).
- `sub` initially is a copy of `arr`, so `sub` = `[-3, -6, 2, 7]`.
- The loop iterates over indices 0 and 2:
  - At index 0, `sub[0]` is `-3`. It is multiplied by 5, resulting in `-15`. So, `sub` becomes `[-15, -6, 2, 7]`.
  - At index 2, `sub[2]` is `2`. It is multiplied by 5, resulting in `10`. So, `sub` becomes `[-15, -6, 10, 7]`.
- The loop does not process indices 1 and 3, so elements at these indices remain unchanged.

The final modified list `sub` is `[-15, -6, 10, 7]`.
