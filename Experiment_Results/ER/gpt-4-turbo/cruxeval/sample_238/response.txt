<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes two parameters: `ls`, which is a list of lists, and `n`, which is a number. The function initializes a variable `answer` to 0. It then iterates through each sublist `i` in the list `ls`. During each iteration, it checks if the first element of the sublist `i` (i.e., `i[0]`) is equal to `n`. If this condition is true, it assigns the sublist `i` to the variable `answer`. After completing the iteration through all sublists, the function returns the value of `answer`.

For the given input `f([[1, 9, 4], [83, 0, 5], [9, 6, 100]], 1)`, the function will process as follows:
- It starts with `answer = 0`.
- It checks the first sublist `[1, 9, 4]`. The first element is `1`, which matches `n` (1). Therefore, `answer` is updated to `[1, 9, 4]`.
- It then checks the next sublist `[83, 0, 5]`. The first element is `83`, which does not match `n` (1). `answer` remains `[1, 9, 4]`.
- It checks the last sublist `[9, 6, 100]`. The first element is `9`, which does not match `n` (1). `answer` remains `[1, 9, 4]`.
- The loop completes, and the function returns the value of `answer`, which is `[1, 9, 4]`.

[1, 9, 4]
