<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a dictionary d as input. Inside the function, a new dictionary r is created with two keys 'c' and 'd', both of which are assigned the value of a copy of the input dictionary d. The method d.copy() creates a shallow copy of the dictionary.

The return statement of the function checks two conditions:
1. r['c'] is r['d']: This checks if the two dictionary copies (r['c'] and r['d']) are the same object in memory. Since both are created using d.copy(), they are different objects, hence this condition evaluates to False.
2. r['c'] == r['d']: This checks if the two dictionary copies are equal in content. Since both copies were made from the same original dictionary and no modifications were made to them, they have the same content, hence this condition evaluates to True.

Therefore, the function returns a tuple (False, True) indicating that the two copies are not the same object (False) but are equal in content (True).

<<<Output>>>
(False, True)
