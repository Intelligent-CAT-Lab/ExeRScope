<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list `mylist` as input. It performs the following operations:
1. `revl = mylist[:]` creates a copy of `mylist` and assigns it to `revl`.
2. `revl.reverse()` reverses the order of elements in `revl`. For the input `[5, 8]`, `revl` becomes `[8, 5]`.
3. `mylist.sort(reverse=True)` sorts `mylist` in descending order. Since the input list `[5, 8]` is already in ascending order, sorting it in descending order changes it to `[8, 5]`.
4. `return mylist == revl` checks if the sorted `mylist` is equal to the reversed list `revl`. Both lists are `[8, 5]`, so they are equal.

The function returns `True` because the sorted list is equal to the reversed list.
