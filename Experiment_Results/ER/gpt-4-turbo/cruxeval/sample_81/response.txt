<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes two parameters: `dic`, a dictionary, and `inx`, a string. The function attempts to find the index of `inx` in the list of keys of `dic`. If found, it modifies the corresponding key in the dictionary to its lowercase version. If `inx` is not found, it catches a `ValueError` and does nothing.

Step-by-step for the given input:
1. `dic` is `{"Bulls": 23, "White Sox": 45}` and `inx` is `"Bulls"`.
2. The keys of `dic` are converted to a list: `["Bulls", "White Sox"]`.
3. The function searches for the index of `"Bulls"` in this list, which is found at index 0.
4. The key at index 0 in the dictionary (`"Bulls"`) is then converted to lowercase (`"bulls"`).
5. The dictionary is updated to `{"bulls": 23, "White Sox": 45}`.
6. The function returns the list of items of the updated dictionary.

<<<Output>>>
[('bulls', 23), ('White Sox', 45)]
