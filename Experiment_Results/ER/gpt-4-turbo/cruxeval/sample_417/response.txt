<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list lst as input and performs the following operations:
1. It reverses the list. For the input [7, 8, 2, 8], after reversing, the list becomes [8, 2, 8, 7].
2. It pops the last element from the reversed list. After popping, the last element (7) is removed, leaving the list as [8, 2, 8].
3. It reverses the list again. After reversing the list [8, 2, 8], it remains [8, 2, 8] as reversing it does not change the order in this specific case.
4. Finally, it returns the modified list.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [7, 8, 2, 8] is [8, 2, 8].
<<<Output>>>
[8, 2, 8]
