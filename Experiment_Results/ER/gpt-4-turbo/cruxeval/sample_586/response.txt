<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two parameters: a string 'text' and a character 'char'. It returns the last index where 'char' appears in 'text' using the rindex method. The rindex method searches the string from the end and returns the last position where the specified value appears. If the value is not found, it raises a ValueError.

In this case, the function is called with the arguments "breakfast" and "e". The string "breakfast" contains the character "e" at index 2 (considering 0-based indexing). Since "e" appears only once in "breakfast", the last index is also 2.

<<<Output>>>
2
