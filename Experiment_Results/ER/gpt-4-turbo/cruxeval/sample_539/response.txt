The function `f` takes an array as input. In this case, the input is an empty list `[]`.

1. The function initializes `c` and `array_copy` to reference the same list as the input array. Since lists are mutable in Python, both `c` and `array_copy` point to the same list object.

2. The function enters a `while True` loop, which is an infinite loop unless broken internally.

3. Inside the loop, `_` is appended to the list `c`. Since `c` and `array_copy` are referencing the same list, appending to `c` also modifies `array_copy`.

4. The condition `if c == array_copy` is always `True` because `c` and `array_copy` are the same object.

5. The code then attempts to replace the first occurrence of `_` in `array_copy` with an empty string `''`. However, this operation is incorrect because `array_copy[c.index('_')] = ''` does not remove the element but replaces it with an empty string. The correct method to remove an element would be using `del` or `pop()`.

6. The loop breaks immediately after modifying the list.

7. The function returns `array_copy`, which now contains an empty string `['']` instead of being completely empty.

The final output of the function when called with an empty list `[]` is `['']` due to the incorrect replacement of `_` with an empty string.
