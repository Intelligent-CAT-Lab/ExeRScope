<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two parameters: a string `s` and a character `ch`. It first assigns the string `s` to a new variable `sl`. The function then checks if the character `ch` is present in the string `s`. If `ch` is found, it strips all occurrences of `ch` from the left side of the string `s` and assigns this new string to `sl`. If after stripping, the length of `sl` is zero (meaning all characters in `s` were instances of `ch`), it appends the string '!?' to `sl`. If `ch` is not found in `s`, the function immediately returns 'no'.

For the input `f("@@@ff", '@')`:
1. `s` is "@@@ff" and `ch` is '@'.
2. The character '@' is present in `s`.
3. The function strips all '@' characters from the left of `s`, resulting in "ff" (assigned to `sl`).
4. The length of `sl` after stripping is not zero (it's 2), so it does not append '!?'.
5. The function returns the value of `sl`, which is "ff".

<<<Output>>>
'ff'
