<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes two arguments: `places`, a list of integers, and `lazy`, a list of integers to be removed from `places`. Here's the step-by-step analysis of the function execution with the given inputs:

1. **Sorting the List**: The `places` list `[375, 564, 857, 90, 728, 92]` is sorted to `[90, 92, 375, 564, 728, 857]`.

2. **Removing Elements**: The elements from the `lazy` list `[728]` are removed from the sorted `places` list. After removal, `places` becomes `[90, 92, 375, 564, 857]`.

3. **Checking Length**: The function checks if the length of `places` is 1. In this case, it is not (length is 5), so it skips to the next step.

4. **Finding Missing Consecutive Number**: The function iterates through the `places` list to find the first place where the consecutive number (current number + 1) is missing. Here's the breakdown:
   - `90` is followed by `92` (91 is missing but not checked directly).
   - `92` is followed by `375` (93 to 374 are missing, but the check is for immediate consecutive).
   - `375` is followed by `564` (376 to 563 are missing, but the check is for immediate consecutive).
   - `564` is followed by `857` (565 to 856 are missing, but the check is for immediate consecutive).
   - Since `857` is the last element, and there is no element after it, the loop ends.

5. **Returning the Result**: The loop completes without finding a direct consecutive missing number (i.e., number + 1). The function returns the index of the last element + 1, which is `5` (0-based index of `857` is 4, so 4+1=5).
