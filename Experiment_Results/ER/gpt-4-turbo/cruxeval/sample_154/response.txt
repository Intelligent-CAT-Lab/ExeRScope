<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two parameters: a string s and a character c. The function first splits the string s into a list of words using the space character as a delimiter. This results in the list ['Hello', 'There'] for the input 'Hello There'. Next, the function reverses this list, resulting in ['There', 'Hello']. The reversed list is then joined back into a single string with two spaces between each word, resulting in "There  Hello". Finally, the function concatenates the character c with two spaces, followed by the reversed and joined string, resulting in '*  There  Hello' when c is '*'. Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the inputs 'Hello There' and '*' is '*  There  Hello'.
