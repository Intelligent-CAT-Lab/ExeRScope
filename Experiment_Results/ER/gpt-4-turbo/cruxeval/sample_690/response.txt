<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes an input n and first checks if the string representation of n contains a decimal point ('.'). This is done using the find method on the string representation of n. If a decimal point is found, the find method will return an index that is not -1. If no decimal point is found, the find method returns -1.

In this specific case, the input '800' is already a string and does not contain a decimal point. Therefore, the condition `str(n).find('.') != -1` evaluates to False.

Since the condition is False, the function skips the if block and directly goes to the return statement in the else part, which is `return str(n)`. Here, since n is already a string ('800'), it simply returns '800'.

<<<Output>>>
'800'
