<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes a string `text` as input and performs several operations involving global variables and string replacements:
1. The global variable `field` is assigned the value of `text` with all spaces removed.
2. The global variable `g` is assigned the value of `text` with all occurrences of '0' replaced by spaces.
3. The local variable `text` itself is modified by replacing all occurrences of '1' with 'i'.

For the input '00000000 00000000 01101100 01100101 01101110':
- `field` becomes '00000000000000001101100011001010110110' (all spaces removed).
- `g` becomes '        iiii ii  ii ii  ii ii' (all '0's replaced by spaces).
- `text` becomes '00000000 00000000 0ii0ii00 0ii00i0e 0ii0iin' (all '1's replaced by 'i').

The function returns the modified `text`.

<<<Output>>>
'00000000 00000000 0ii0ii00 0ii00i0e 0ii0iin'
