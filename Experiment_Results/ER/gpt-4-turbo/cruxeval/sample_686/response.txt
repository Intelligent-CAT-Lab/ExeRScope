<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes two parameters: a dictionary `d` and a list `l`. It initializes an empty dictionary `new_d`. The function then iterates over each element `k` in the list `l`. For each element, it checks if `k` is a key in the dictionary `d` using `d.get(k)`. If `k` is found in `d`, it adds the key-value pair `k: d[k]` to the dictionary `new_d`. After iterating through all elements in the list, the function returns a copy of `new_d`.

In this specific call `f({"lorem ipsum" : 12, "dolor" : 23}, ["lorem ipsum", "dolor"])`, the dictionary `d` contains two key-value pairs: `"lorem ipsum": 12` and `"dolor": 23`. The list `l` contains the keys `"lorem ipsum"` and `"dolor"`. Both keys exist in the dictionary `d`, so they are added to `new_d`. Therefore, `new_d` will have the same key-value pairs as `d`.

Finally, the function returns a copy of `new_d`, which contains the key-value pairs `"lorem ipsum": 12` and `"dolor": 23`.
<<<Output>>>
{'lorem ipsum': 12, 'dolor': 23}
