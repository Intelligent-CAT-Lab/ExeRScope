<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two parameters: a string 'text' and a string 'delim'. The function aims to return a substring from 'text', which is determined by finding the last occurrence of 'delim' in 'text'.

1. The function first reverses the string 'text'. For the input 'dsj osq wi w', the reversed string is 'w iw qso jsd'.
2. It then finds the index of the first occurrence of 'delim' (which is a space ' ') in this reversed string. In 'w iw qso jsd', the first space appears at index 1.
3. The function then takes the substring of the original 'text' up to the index found in step 2, but since the string was reversed for finding the index, it effectively takes the substring from the start of 'text' to the last occurrence of 'delim' in the original 'text'. For 'dsj osq wi w', the last space is before the last 'w', so the substring up to this point is 'dsj osq wi'.
4. Finally, the function returns this substring reversed. Reversing 'dsj osq wi' gives 'iw qso jsd'.

Therefore, the output of the function f on the input ('dsj osq wi w', ' ') is 'iw qso jsd'.

'iw qso jsd'
