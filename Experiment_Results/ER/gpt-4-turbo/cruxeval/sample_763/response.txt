<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes three parameters: `values`, `text`, and `markers`. It processes the input by first using the `rstrip` method on `text` with `values` as the argument, which removes all trailing characters from `text` that are present in `values`. Since `markers` is an empty string, the second `rstrip` operation does not change the result further.

In this specific case:
- `values` is '2Pn'
- `text` is 'yCxpg2C2Pny2'
- `markers` is ''

The `rstrip('2Pn')` operation on 'yCxpg2C2Pny2' will remove the trailing characters that match any of '2', 'P', or 'n' from the end of the string. The last character '2' matches, so it is removed. The next character 'y' does not match any in '2Pn', so the stripping stops there.

The result after this operation is 'yCxpg2C2Pny'. Since `markers` is an empty string, the second `rstrip` does nothing further.

<<<Output>>>
'yCxpg2C2Pny'
