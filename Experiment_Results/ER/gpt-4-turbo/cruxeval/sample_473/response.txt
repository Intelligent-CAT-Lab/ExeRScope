<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes two parameters: `text`, a string, and `value`, a character. The function aims to remove all occurrences of `value` from `text`.

1. The function initializes an empty list `indexes` to store the indices of occurrences of `value` in `text`.
2. It iterates over the range of the length of `text` using a for loop. For each index `i`, it checks if `text[i]` is equal to `value`. If true, it appends `i` to the `indexes` list.
3. After collecting all indices, the function converts `text` into a list of characters called `new_text`.
4. It then iterates over the `indexes` list and removes the character at each index from `new_text`. However, since `new_text.remove(value)` removes the first occurrence of `value` each time, it effectively removes all occurrences of `value` from `new_text`.
5. Finally, it joins `new_text` back into a string and returns it.

For the input `f('scedvtvotkwqfoqn', 'o')`:
- The `indexes` list will contain the indices of 'o' in the string, which are [6, 8].
- The `new_text` will initially be a list of characters of the input string.
- The loop removes each 'o' found at the indices in `indexes`.
- The resulting `new_text` after removing 'o' characters will be `['s', 'c', 'e', 'd', 'v', 't', 'v', 't', 'k', 'w', 'q', 'f', 'q', 'n']`.
- Joining these characters results in the string "scedvtvtkwqfqn".
