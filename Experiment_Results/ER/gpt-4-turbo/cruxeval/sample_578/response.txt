<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a dictionary obj as input. It iterates over each key-value pair in the dictionary. If the value (v) associated with a key (k) is greater than or equal to 0, it modifies the value at that key to be its negative counterpart. If the value is already negative, it remains unchanged.

For the input dictionary {'R': 0, 'T': 3, 'F': -6, 'K': 0}:
1. The key 'R' has a value of 0, which is >= 0, so it is changed to -0 (which is still 0).
2. The key 'T' has a value of 3, which is >= 0, so it is changed to -3.
3. The key 'F' has a value of -6, which is not >= 0, so it remains -6.
4. The key 'K' has a value of 0, which is >= 0, so it is changed to -0 (which is still 0).

After processing all key-value pairs, the dictionary becomes {'R': 0, 'T': -3, 'F': -6, 'K': 0}.
<<<Output>>>
{'R': 0, 'T': -3, 'F': -6, 'K': 0}
