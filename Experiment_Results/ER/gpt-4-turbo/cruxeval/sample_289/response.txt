<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string 'code' as input and returns a formatted string that includes the original string and its encoded version in bytes. The encoding used is the default UTF-8 encoding.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input '148', we need to:
1. Encode the string '148' using UTF-8 encoding. The string '148' when encoded results in the bytes b'148'.
2. Format the string to include the original string '148' and its encoded version b'148'.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input '148' is "148: b'148'".
<<<Output>>>
'148: b\'148\''
