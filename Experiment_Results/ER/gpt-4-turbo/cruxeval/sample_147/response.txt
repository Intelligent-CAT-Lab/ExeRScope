<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of numbers as input. It calculates the middle index of the list by dividing the length of the list by 2 using integer division (//). For the input list [1, 1, 1], the length is 3, so the middle index calculated is 3//2 = 1. The function then returns a new list that starts from this middle index to the end of the list, followed by the elements from the start of the list up to the middle index. Specifically, for the input [1, 1, 1], the elements from index 1 to the end are [1, 1], and the elements from the start to index 1 are [1]. Therefore, the output list is [1, 1] + [1].
