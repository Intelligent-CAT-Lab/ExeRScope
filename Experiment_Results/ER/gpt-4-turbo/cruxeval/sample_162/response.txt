<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string 'text' as input and initializes an empty string 'result'. It then iterates over each character in the input string. For each character, it checks if the character is alphanumeric (letters or digits) using the char.isalnum() method. If the character is alphanumeric, it converts the character to uppercase using char.upper() and appends it to 'result'. Non-alphanumeric characters (like spaces and punctuation) are ignored.

For the input 'с bishop.Swift':
1. 'с' is alphanumeric and is converted to uppercase 'С'.
2. ' ' (space) is not alphanumeric, so it is ignored.
3. 'b' is alphanumeric and is converted to uppercase 'B'.
4. 'i' is alphanumeric and is converted to uppercase 'I'.
5. 's' is alphanumeric and is converted to uppercase 'S'.
6. 'h' is alphanumeric and is converted to uppercase 'H'.
7. 'o' is alphanumeric and is converted to uppercase 'O'.
8. 'p' is alphanumeric and is converted to uppercase 'P'.
9. '.' (dot) is not alphanumeric, so it is ignored.
10. 'S' is already uppercase and alphanumeric.
11. 'w' is alphanumeric and is converted to uppercase 'W'.
12. 'i' is alphanumeric and is converted to uppercase 'I'.
13. 'f' is alphanumeric and is converted to uppercase 'F'.
14. 't' is alphanumeric and is converted to uppercase 'T'.

The final result after processing all characters is 'СBISHOPSWIFT'.
<<<Output>>>
'СBISHOPSWIFT'
