<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes a string `book` as input and processes it to potentially remove redundant words around a colon `:`. Here's the step-by-step analysis for the input `"udhv zcvi nhtnfyd :erwuyawa pun"`:

1. The string is split into two parts around the last colon using `rsplit(':', 1)`, resulting in `a = ['udhv zcvi nhtnfyd', 'erwuyawa pun']`.
2. The last word of the first part `a[0]` is `'nhtnfyd'` and the first word of the second part `a[1]` is `'erwuyawa'`.
3. These two words are compared. Since `'nhtnfyd'` is not equal to `'erwuyawa'`, the condition in the if statement is false.
4. The function then returns the original input string because no modification is needed.

Therefore, the function will return the input string as it is, without any changes.

<<<Output>>>
'udhv zcvi nhtnfyd :erwuyawa pun'
