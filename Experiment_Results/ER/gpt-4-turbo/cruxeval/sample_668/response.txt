<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string 'text' as input and returns a new string. This new string is formed by taking the last character of the input string and concatenating it with the rest of the string excluding the last character. Specifically:
1. text[-1] extracts the last character of the string 'text'.
2. text[:-1] extracts the string from the beginning up to, but not including, the last character.
For the input 'hellomyfriendear', text[-1] is 'r' and text[:-1] is 'hellomyfriendea'.
Thus, the function concatenates 'r' with 'hellomyfriendea' to form 'rhellomyfriendea'.

<<<Output>>>
'rhellomyfriendea'
