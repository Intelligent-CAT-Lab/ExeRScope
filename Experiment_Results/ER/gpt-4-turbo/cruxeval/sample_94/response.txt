<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two dictionaries, a and b, as input and returns a new dictionary that results from merging these two dictionaries. In Python, the expression {**a, **b} merges dictionary a and dictionary b. If there are overlapping keys, the values from dictionary b will overwrite those from dictionary a.

In this specific case, the input dictionaries are {'w': 5, 'wi': 10} and {'w': 3}. Both dictionaries have the key 'w'. According to the merging rule, the value of 'w' in the resulting dictionary will be 3 (from dictionary b), overwriting the value 5 from dictionary a. The key 'wi' from dictionary a remains unchanged as it does not conflict with any key in dictionary b.

Therefore, the output of the function f when called with these dictionaries will be a new dictionary with the keys and values as described.
<<<Output>>>
{'w': 3, 'wi': 10}
