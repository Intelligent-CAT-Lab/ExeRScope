<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes two parameters: `str`, which is a string, and `char`, which is a character. The function performs the following steps:
1. It calculates the number of times `char` appears in `str` using `str.count(char)`.
2. It then creates a new string `base` by repeating `char` one more time than its count in `str`.
3. Finally, it removes the suffix `base` from `str` using `str.removesuffix(base)` and returns the result.

For the input `str = 'mnmnj krupa...##!@#!@#$$@##'` and `char = '@'`:
- The count of '@' in `str` is 4.
- Therefore, `base` will be '@' repeated 5 times, which is '@@@@@'.
- The function then attempts to remove the suffix '@@@@@' from `str`. Since '@@@@@' does not appear at the end of `str`, the original string is returned unchanged.

<<<Output>>>
'mnmnj krupa...##!@#!@#$$@##'
