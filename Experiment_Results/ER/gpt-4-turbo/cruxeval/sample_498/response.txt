<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three parameters: a list `nums`, an integer `idx`, and a value `added`. The function inserts the value `added` into the list `nums` at the position specified by `idx`. The insertion does not replace any existing elements but instead shifts them rightward. The syntax `nums[idx:idx] = (added,)` is used for this insertion. Here, `(added,)` creates a tuple containing the element `added`, which is then inserted into the list at the specified index.

For the given input `f([2, 2, 2, 3, 3], 2, 3)`, the function will operate as follows:
- `nums` is initially `[2, 2, 2, 3, 3]`.
- `idx` is `2`, so the insertion point is between the second and third elements of the list.
- `added` is `3`, so this value is inserted at index `2`.
- After insertion, the list becomes `[2, 2, 3, 2, 3, 3]`.

Thus, the function modifies the list and returns the new list with the inserted element.

[2, 2, 3, 2, 3, 3]
