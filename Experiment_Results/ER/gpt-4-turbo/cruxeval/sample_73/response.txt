<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string `row` as input and returns a tuple. The first element of the tuple is the count of '1's in the string, and the second element is the count of '0's in the string.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "100010010", we need to count the occurrences of '1' and '0' in the string.
In the string "100010010":
- '1' appears 4 times.
- '0' appears 5 times.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "100010010" is a tuple (4, 5).

<<<Output>>>
(4, 5)
