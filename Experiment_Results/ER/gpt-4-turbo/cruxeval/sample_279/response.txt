<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes a string `text` as input and initializes an empty string `ans`. It then enters a while loop that continues as long as `text` is not an empty string. Inside the loop, it uses the `partition` method to split `text` into three parts based on the first occurrence of '(': the part before '(', the '(' itself, and the part after '('.

However, since the input string is empty, the while loop condition `text != ''` fails immediately. Therefore, the loop does not execute, and the function directly proceeds to return the initial value of `ans`, which is an empty string.
