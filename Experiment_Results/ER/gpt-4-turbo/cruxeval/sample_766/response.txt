<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes two parameters: `values`, which is expected to be a list of strings, and `value`, which can be any data type. Here's the step-by-step analysis of the function execution with the given inputs `['0', '3']` and `117`:

1. Calculate the length of the list `values`. In this case, `length = len(['0', '3'])` which equals 2. However, this `length` variable is not used elsewhere in the function.

2. Create a new dictionary `new_dict` using `dict.fromkeys(values, value)`. This will create a dictionary where each element in `values` becomes a key, and all keys have the same value, which is the second parameter `value`. For the input `['0', '3']` and `117`, `new_dict` will initially be `{'0': 117, '3': 117}`.

3. Modify `new_dict` by adding a new key that is the result of the sorted `values` list joined into a string, and its value is `value` multiplied by 3. Sorting `['0', '3']` results in `['0', '3']` (as they are already in order), and joining them results in the string `'03'`. The value associated with this key will be `117 * 3 = 351`.

4. The final dictionary `new_dict` after all these operations will be `{'0': 117, '3': 117, '03': 351}`.

5. Return the `new_dict`.

<<<Output>>>
{'0': 117, '3': 117, '03': 351}
