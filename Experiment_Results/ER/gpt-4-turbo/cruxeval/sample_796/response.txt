<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two parameters: str and toget. It checks if the string str starts with the substring toget using the str.startswith(toget) method. If str does start with toget, the function returns the substring of str that begins right after the toget substring ends, which is calculated as str[len(toget):]. If str does not start with toget, the function simply returns str.

In this specific call f('fnuiyh', 'ni'), we need to check if 'fnuiyh' starts with 'ni'. The startswith method will return False because 'fnuiyh' actually starts with 'fn', not 'ni'. Since the condition is False, the function will execute the else part and return the original string 'fnuiyh'.

<<<Output>>>
'fnuiyh'
