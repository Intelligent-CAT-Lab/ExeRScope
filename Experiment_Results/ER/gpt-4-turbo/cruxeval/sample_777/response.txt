<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes two parameters: `names`, a list of strings, and `excluded`, a string that should be excluded from each string in the `names` list. The function iterates over the list `names` and for each string in the list, it checks if the string `excluded` is a substring. If it is, it replaces occurrences of `excluded` with an empty string.

In this specific call `f(["avc  a .d e"], "")`, the `excluded` string is an empty string `""`. When the `replace` method is called with an empty string as the substring to replace, it does not alter the original string because replacing an empty substring effectively does nothing to the original string.

Therefore, the strings in the `names` list remain unchanged after the execution of the function.

<<<Output>>>
["avc  a .d e"]
