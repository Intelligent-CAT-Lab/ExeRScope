<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of numbers called nums as input and returns the element at the middle index of the list. The middle index is calculated using the expression len(nums)//2, which performs integer division of the length of the list by 2.

For the input list [-1, -3, -5, -7, 0]:
1. The length of the list is 5.
2. The middle index is calculated as 5 // 2 = 2.

The element at index 2 in the list [-1, -3, -5, -7, 0] is -5. Therefore, the function returns -5.
<<<Output>>>
-5
