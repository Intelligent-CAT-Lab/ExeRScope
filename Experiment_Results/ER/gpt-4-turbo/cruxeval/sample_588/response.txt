<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two parameters: a list of items and a target value. It checks if the target value is present in the list. If the target is found, it returns the index of the first occurrence of the target in the list. If the target is not found, it returns -1.

In this specific case, the list of items is ['1', '+', '-', '**', '//', '*', '+'] and the target is '**'. The function will check if '**' is in the list. Since '**' is indeed present in the list, the function then proceeds to find the index of '**'. The index of the first occurrence of '**' in the list is 3.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the given input will be 3.
