<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string 'filename' as input. The steps involved in the function are as follows:
1. It extracts the suffix from the filename by splitting the string at each '.' and taking the last element. For the input 'docs.doc', the suffix will be 'doc'.
2. It then creates a new string 'f2' by appending the reverse of the suffix to the original filename. The reverse of 'doc' is 'cod', so 'f2' becomes 'docs.doccod'.
3. Finally, the function checks if 'f2' ends with the original suffix 'doc'. In this case, 'docs.doccod' does not end with 'doc', so the function will return False.

<<<Output>>>
False
