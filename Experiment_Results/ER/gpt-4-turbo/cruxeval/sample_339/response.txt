<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two parameters: an array and an element (elem). The function first converts the element (elem) to a string. It initializes a counter variable d to 0. The function then iterates through each item in the array, converting each item to a string and comparing it to the string representation of elem. If they match, it increments the counter d by 1. After iterating through all items in the array, the function returns the value of d, which represents the number of times elem appears in the array.

For the given input array `[-1, 2, 1, -8, -8, 2]` and elem `2`:
1. Convert elem to string: elem becomes "2".
2. Initialize d to 0.
3. Iterate through the array:
   - Compare "-1" to "2" (no match).
   - Compare "2" to "2" (match, increment d to 1).
   - Compare "1" to "2" (no match).
   - Compare "-8" to "2" (no match).
   - Compare "-8" to "2" (no match).
   - Compare "2" to "2" (match, increment d to 2).
4. The loop completes, and the function returns the value of d, which is 2.

Therefore, the function counts the number of times the element 2 appears in the array, which is 2 times.
