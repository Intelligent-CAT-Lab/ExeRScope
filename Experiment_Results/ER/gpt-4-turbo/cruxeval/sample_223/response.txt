The function `f` takes two parameters: an array and a target value. It initializes two variables, `count` and `i`, to 0 and 1 respectively. The function then iterates through the array starting from the second element (index 1). For each element at index `j`:
- If the element at `j` is greater than the element at `j-1` and less than or equal to the target, it increments `count` by `i`.
- If the element at `j` is less than or equal to the element at `j-1`, it resets `i` to 1.
- Otherwise, it increments `i` by 1.

Let's apply this logic to the input array `[1, 2, -1, 4]` with the target `2`:
1. `j = 1`: `array[1]` is 2, `array[0]` is 1. Since 2 > 1 and 2 <= 2, `count` is incremented by `i` (1). Now, `count = 1`.
2. `j = 2`: `array[2]` is -1, `array[1]` is 2. Since -1 <= 2, `i` is reset to 1.
3. `j = 3`: `array[3]` is 4, `array[2]` is -1. Since 4 > -1 but 4 > 2, `i` is incremented by 1 (now `i = 2`).

The loop ends, and the function returns `count`, which is 1.
