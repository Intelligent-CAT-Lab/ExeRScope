<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes two parameters: `list` and `operation`. Here's the step-by-step analysis of the function execution with the given inputs:
1. `list` is `[6, 4, 2, 8, 15]`.
2. `new_list` is created as a copy of `list` using `list[:]`.
3. `new_list.sort()` sorts `new_list` in ascending order, resulting in `[2, 4, 6, 8, 15]`.
4. `operation(new_list)` is called with the lambda function `(lambda x: x.reverse())`. This lambda function reverses `new_list`, changing it to `[15, 8, 6, 4, 2]`.
5. The function returns the original `list`, which has not been modified within the function.

Therefore, the original list `[6, 4, 2, 8, 15]` is returned as it is, unaffected by the operations performed on `new_list`.
<<<Output>>>
[6, 4, 2, 8, 15]
