<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a single string input called 'text'. This string is expected to contain two substrings separated by a comma. The function splits the input string into two parts using the split(',') method, resulting in two substrings: string_a and string_b. In the case of the input 'dog,cat', string_a will be 'dog' and string_b will be 'cat'.

Next, the function calculates the length of each substring. The length of 'dog' is 3, and the length of 'cat' is also 3. These lengths are then added together, resulting in a sum of 6.

Finally, the function returns the negative of this sum, which is -6. Therefore, the output of the function f when called with the input 'dog,cat' is -6.
<<<Output>>>
-6
