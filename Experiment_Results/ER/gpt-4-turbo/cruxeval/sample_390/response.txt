<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string 'text' as input. It first checks if the stripped version of 'text' (removing any leading and trailing whitespace) is empty using the condition `not text.strip()`. If this condition is true, it returns the length of the stripped text. Otherwise, it returns None.

For the input " \t ":
1. The `strip()` method removes all leading and trailing whitespace, including tabs. Therefore, `text.strip()` results in an empty string "".
2. The condition `not text.strip()` checks if the stripped text is empty. Since it is indeed empty, the condition is true.
3. The function then returns `len(text.strip())`, which is the length of the empty string, i.e., 0.
