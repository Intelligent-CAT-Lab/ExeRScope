<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and performs two replace operations on it. The first replace operation changes all occurrences of '(' with '['. The second replace operation changes all occurrences of ')' with ']'. 
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "(ac)", we first replace '(' with '[', resulting in "[ac)". Then, we replace ')' with ']', resulting in "[ac]". 
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "(ac)" is "[ac]".
<<<Output>>>
'[ac]'
