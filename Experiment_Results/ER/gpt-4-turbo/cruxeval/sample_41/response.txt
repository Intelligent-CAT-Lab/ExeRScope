<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two parameters: an array and a list of values. It performs the following operations:
1. Reverse the array. Initially, the array is [58]. After reversing, it remains [58] since it contains only one element.
2. Insert each value from the values list into the middle of the array. The length of the array is 1, so the middle index is 1 // 2 = 0.
   - First, insert 21 at index 0. The array becomes [21, 58].
   - Next, insert 92 at index 1 (since the new length of the array is 2, and 2 // 2 = 1). The array becomes [21, 92, 58].
3. Reverse the array again. The array [21, 92, 58] becomes [58, 92, 21] after reversing.
4. Return the final array.

<<<Output>>>
[58, 92, 21]
