<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes a list `array` as input and initializes `prev` to the first element of the array. It then creates a copy of the array called `newArray`. The function iterates through the array starting from the second element. During each iteration, it checks if the current element is different from the previous element (`prev`). If they are different, it assigns the current element to the corresponding index in `newArray`. If they are the same, it deletes the current element from `newArray`. After each iteration, it updates `prev` to the current element.

For the input `[1, 2, 3]`:
- `prev` starts as `1`.
- The loop starts with `i = 1` (element `2`):
  - `prev` (1) is not equal to `array[1]` (2), so `newArray[1]` remains `2`.
  - `prev` is updated to `2`.
- Next, `i = 2` (element `3`):
  - `prev` (2) is not equal to `array[2]` (3), so `newArray[2]` remains `3`.
  - `prev` is updated to `3`.

Since there are no duplicate consecutive elements, `newArray` remains unchanged from its initial copy of `array`. Therefore, the function returns `[1, 2, 3]`.

[1, 2, 3]
