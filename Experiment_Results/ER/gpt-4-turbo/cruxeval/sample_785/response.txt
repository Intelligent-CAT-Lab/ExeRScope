<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes an integer n as input and converts it to a string. It then iterates over each character (digit) in the string. For each character, it uses the `ljust` method to left-justify the character in a string of length equal to twice the integer value of the character. This means each digit is repeated twice its own value in the resulting string.

For the input 1:
1. Convert 1 to a string, resulting in '1'.
2. Iterate over the string. There is only one character '1'.
3. For the character '1', convert it to an integer (which is 1), and use `ljust` to create a string of length 2 containing the character '1' left-justified. This results in '11' (since '1'.ljust(2) repeats '1' twice).
4. Concatenate this result to the variable `streak`.

Finally, the function returns the value of `streak`, which is '11'.
<<<Output>>>
'11'
