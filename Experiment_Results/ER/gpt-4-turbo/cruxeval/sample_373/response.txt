<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list 'orig' as input. The first step inside the function is to assign the list 'orig' to a new variable 'copy'. In Python, lists are mutable, and assigning one list to another does not create a new list but rather a reference to the original list. Therefore, both 'copy' and 'orig' refer to the same list.

Next, the function appends the value 100 to 'copy'. Since 'copy' and 'orig' are references to the same list, this operation effectively adds 100 to the end of the original list, modifying both 'copy' and 'orig' to [1, 2, 3, 100].

Following this, the function removes the last element from 'orig' using the pop() method. Since 'orig' and 'copy' are still the same list, this operation removes the last element (which is 100 after the append operation) from both 'copy' and 'orig', resulting in the list [1, 2, 3].

Finally, the function returns 'copy', which now is [1, 2, 3] after the append and pop operations.
