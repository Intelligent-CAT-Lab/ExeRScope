<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes two parameters: `text` and `search_string`. It initializes an empty list `indexes` to store the indices of occurrences of `search_string` in `text`. The function uses a while loop to find the rightmost index of `search_string` in `text` using `text.rindex(search_string)`, appends this index to `indexes`, and then slices `text` to exclude the found `search_string` and everything after it. This process repeats until `search_string` is no longer found in `text`.

For the input `f('ONBPICJOHRHDJOSNCPNJ9ONTHBQCJ', 'J')`:
1. The initial `text` is 'ONBPICJOHRHDJOSNCPNJ9ONTHBQCJ'.
2. The rightmost 'J' is found at index 25. `indexes` becomes [25], and `text` is sliced to 'ONBPICJOHRHDJOSNCPNJ9'.
3. The next 'J' is found at index 16. `indexes` becomes [25, 16], and `text` is sliced to 'ONBPICJOHRHDJOSN'.
4. The next 'J' is found at index 13. `indexes` becomes [25, 16, 13], and `text` is sliced to 'ONBPICJOHRHD'.
5. The next 'J' is found at index 8. `indexes` becomes [25, 16, 13, 8], and `text` is sliced to 'ONBPICJO'.
6. The next 'J' is found at index 7. `indexes` becomes [25, 16, 13, 8, 7], and `text` is sliced to 'ONBPIC'.
7. No more 'J' is found, so the loop ends.

The final list of indexes where 'J' appears, from rightmost to leftmost in the original string, is [25, 16, 13, 8, 7].
