<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes an integer num as input and checks two conditions:
1. The number must be greater than 0 and less than 1000.
2. The number must not be equal to 6174.

If both conditions are satisfied, the function returns the string 'Half Life'. If either condition is not met, it returns 'Not found'.

For the input 6173:
- 6173 is greater than 0 and less than 1000, so the first condition is satisfied.
- 6173 is not equal to 6174, so the second condition is also satisfied.

Since both conditions are met, the function will return 'Half Life'.
<<<Output>>>
'Half Life'
