<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes a list of integers `nums` as input. It iterates over the list in reverse order (from the last element to the first). During each iteration, it checks if the current element is odd (i.e., `nums[i] % 2 == 1`). If the element is odd, it inserts a duplicate of this element right after its current position.

Let's analyze the function step by step with the input `[2, 3, 4, 6, -2]`:
1. Start with the last element (`i = 4`), which is `-2`. Since `-2 % 2 == 0`, it is even, so no changes are made.
2. Next element (`i = 3`), which is `6`. Since `6 % 2 == 0`, it is even, so no changes are made.
3. Next element (`i = 2`), which is `4`. Since `4 % 2 == 0`, it is even, so no changes are made.
4. Next element (`i = 1`), which is `3`. Since `3 % 2 == 1`, it is odd, so `3` is inserted after itself. The list now becomes `[2, 3, 3, 4, 6, -2]`.
5. Finally, the first element (`i = 0`), which is `2`. Since `2 % 2 == 0`, it is even, so no changes are made.

After processing all elements, the final list is `[2, 3, 3, 4, 6, -2]`.
