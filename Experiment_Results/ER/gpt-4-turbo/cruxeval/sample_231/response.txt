<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of years as input. It calculates two sums:
1. a10: the count of years that are less than or equal to 1900.
2. a90: the count of years that are greater than 1910.

For the input [1872, 1995, 1945]:
- a10 would be the count of years less than or equal to 1900, which is just 1872. So, a10 = 1.
- a90 would be the count of years greater than 1910, which includes 1995 and 1945. So, a90 = 2.

Next, the function checks:
- If a10 > 3, it returns 3. In this case, a10 = 1, so this condition is false.
- If a90 > 3, it returns 1. In this case, a90 = 2, so this condition is also false.
- If neither condition is met, it returns 2.

Therefore, the function will return 2 for the given input.
