<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and performs several operations to manipulate the string based on the presence of a period ('.').

1. The function uses `s.rpartition('.')` to split the string into three parts: `left`, `sep`, and `right`. The `rpartition` method searches for the last occurrence of the specified separator ('.') and splits the string into the part before the separator, the separator itself, and the part after the separator. If the separator is not found, `left` will be an empty string, `sep` will be an empty string, and `right` will contain the entire original string.

2. In the case of the input 'galgu', since there is no '.' in the string, `left` will be '', `sep` will be '', and `right` will be 'galgu'.

3. The next line constructs a new string `new` by joining `right` and `left` with `sep` in between. Since `sep` is an empty string, `new` will simply be 'galgu'.

4. The function then attempts to partition `new` again using `rpartition('.')` and extracts the separator into `sep`. Since there is still no '.' in `new`, `sep` remains an empty string.

5. Finally, the function returns `new.replace(sep, ', ')`. Since `sep` is an empty string, this replace operation will not change the string, and `new` remains 'galgu'.

Therefore, the output of the function f when called with the input 'galgu' is 'galgu'.
