<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two parameters: a string 'text' and an integer 'num_digits'. It first calculates the 'width' by taking the maximum of 1 and 'num_digits'. In this case, since 'num_digits' is 5, which is greater than 1, 'width' will be 5. The function then returns the string 'text' padded with zeros on the left to make its length equal to 'width'. The method used for this padding is 'zfill', which pads the string 'text' with zeros on the left until the total string length equals 'width'.

For the input 'text' = '19' and 'num_digits' = 5, the function will pad '19' with zeros on the left to make its length 5. The resulting string will be '00019'.

<<<Output>>>
'00019'
