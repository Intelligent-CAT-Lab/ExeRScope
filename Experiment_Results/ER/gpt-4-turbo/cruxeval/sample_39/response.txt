<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two parameters: an array and an element (elem). It checks if the element is present in the array using the 'in' keyword. If the element is found in the array, it returns the index of the first occurrence of that element using the index() method. If the element is not found, it returns -1.

In this specific case, the function is called with the array [6, 2, 7, 1] and the element 6. The function checks if 6 is in the array, which it is. The index of 6 in the array is 0 (since indexing starts from 0 in Python). Therefore, the function will return 0.
