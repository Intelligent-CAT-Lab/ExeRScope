<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes a list `nums` as input. The first step in the function is to determine the count of elements in the list, which is stored in the variable `count`. For the input `[0, 6, 2, -1, -2]`, `count` is 5.

Next, the function iterates over a range defined by `range(-count+1, 0)`. For our input, this range is `range(-4, 0)`, which corresponds to the indices -4, -3, -2, and -1. These indices are used to access elements from the end of the list.

During each iteration, the function extends the list `nums` by adding two copies of the element at the current index. Let's break down each iteration:
1. For index -4 (which corresponds to the first element of the list, 0), the list becomes `[0, 6, 2, -1, -2, 0, 0]`.
2. For index -3 (now corresponds to the second element, 6), the list becomes `[0, 6, 2, -1, -2, 0, 0, 6, 6]`.
3. For index -2 (now corresponds to the third element, 2), the list becomes `[0, 6, 2, -1, -2, 0, 0, 6, 6, 2, 2]`.
4. For index -1 (now corresponds to the fourth element, -1), the list becomes `[0, 6, 2, -1, -2, 0, 0, 6, 6, 2, 2, -1, -1]`.

After completing the loop, the function returns the modified list.

[0, 6, 2, -1, -2, 0, 0, 6, 6, 2, 2, -1, -1]
