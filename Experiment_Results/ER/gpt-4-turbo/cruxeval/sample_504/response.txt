<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of integers, 'values', as input. The function first applies the sort() method to the list 'values'. The sort() method rearranges the elements of the list in ascending order. In this specific case, the input list is [1, 1, 1, 1]. Since all elements are already identical and in ascending order, the sort operation does not change the list. After sorting, the function returns the sorted list.

<<<Output>>>
[1, 1, 1, 1]
