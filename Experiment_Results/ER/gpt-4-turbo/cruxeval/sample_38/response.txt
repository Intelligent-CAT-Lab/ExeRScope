<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string as input and performs two operations on it:
1. It converts the first character of each word in the string to uppercase and the rest to lowercase using the title() method. This method treats any non-alphanumeric character as a word boundary.
2. It then removes all spaces from the string using the replace() method.

For the input '1oE-err bzz-bmm':
- The title() method converts it to '1Oe-Err Bzz-Bmm'. Here, '1oE' becomes '1Oe', 'err' becomes 'Err', 'bzz' becomes 'Bzz', and 'bmm' becomes 'Bmm'.
- The replace() method then removes the spaces, resulting in '1Oe-ErrBzz-Bmm'.

<<<Output>>>
'1Oe-ErrBzz-Bmm'
