<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three parameters: text, char, and replace. It returns a new string where all occurrences of the substring specified by 'char' are replaced with the substring specified by 'replace'.
In this specific call, f('a1a8', '1', 'n2'), the function will:
1. Take the string 'a1a8'.
2. Replace every occurrence of the substring '1' with 'n2'.

Thus, the string 'a1a8' becomes 'an2a8' after the replacement.
<<<Output>>>
'an2a8'
