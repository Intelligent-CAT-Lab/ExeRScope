<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes two parameters: `array` and `elem`. It initializes `k` to 0 and creates a copy of `array` named `l`. The function then iterates over each element `i` in the copied list `l`. During each iteration, it checks if `i` is greater than `elem`. If true, it inserts `elem` into the original `array` at the current index `k` and breaks out of the loop. If no such `i` is found, the loop completes without inserting `elem`.

For the input `f([5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0], 3)`, the steps are as follows:
1. `array` is `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]` and `elem` is `3`.
2. `k` starts at 0.
3. `l` is a copy of `array`, so `l` is `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]`.
4. The loop starts:
   - `i = 5` (first element of `l`), `5 > 3` is true. So, `3` is inserted at index `k` (0) in `array`. Now, `array` becomes `[3, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]`.
   - The loop breaks immediately after the insertion.

The function returns the modified `array` which is `[3, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]`.
