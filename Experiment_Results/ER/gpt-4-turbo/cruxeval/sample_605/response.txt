<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list called nums as input. The first operation inside the function is nums.clear(), which removes all items from the list nums, leaving it empty. After clearing the list, the function returns the string "quack". Therefore, regardless of the initial contents of the list passed to the function, the output will always be the string "quack".
<<<Output>>>
'quack'
