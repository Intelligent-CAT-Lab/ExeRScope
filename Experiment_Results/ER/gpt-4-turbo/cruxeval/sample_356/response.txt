<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two parameters: an array and a number num. It initializes a variable reverse to False. It checks if num is less than 0, in which case it sets reverse to True and multiplies num by -1 to make it positive. The array is then reversed (using array[::-1]) and repeated num times (using * num). The length of the resulting array is stored in variable l, but l is not used further in the function.

For the input ([1, 2], 1):
1. reverse is initially set to False.
2. Since num (1) is not less than 0, reverse remains False and num remains 1.
3. The array [1, 2] is reversed to [2, 1] and then repeated 1 time, resulting in [2, 1].
4. Since reverse is False, the array is not reversed again.
5. The function returns the array [2, 1].

<<<Output>>>
[2, 1]
