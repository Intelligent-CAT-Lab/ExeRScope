<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes two parameters: a list of numbers (`nums`) and a target number (`target`). It initializes two empty lists, `lows` and `higgs`. The function then iterates through each number `i` in the list `nums`. If `i` is less than the target, it appends `i` to the `lows` list. If `i` is greater than or equal to the target, it appends `i` to the `higgs` list. After completing the iteration, the function clears the `lows` list using the `clear()` method, which removes all items from the list, making it empty. Finally, the function returns a tuple containing the now-empty `lows` list and the `higgs` list.

For the input `nums = [12, 516, 5, 2, 3, 214, 51]` and `target = 5`, the function processes as follows:
- `12` is greater than `5`, so it is added to `higgs`.
- `516` is greater than `5`, so it is added to `higgs`.
- `5` is equal to `5`, so it is added to `higgs`.
- `2` is less than `5`, so it is added to `lows`.
- `3` is less than `5`, so it is added to `lows`.
- `214` is greater than `5`, so it is added to `higgs`.
- `51` is greater than `5`, so it is added to `higgs`.

After the loop, `lows` contains `[2, 3]` and `higgs` contains `[12, 516, 5, 214, 51]`. The `lows.clear()` operation then clears the `lows` list, making it `[]`.

Thus, the function returns `([], [12, 516, 5, 214, 51])`.
