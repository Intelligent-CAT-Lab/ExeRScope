<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes a dictionary `d` as input and initializes an empty dictionary `result`. It then iterates over each key-value pair in the input dictionary `d`.

1. For the first key-value pair (2, 0.76):
   - The key `2` is not a float, so the else block executes.
   - The key-value pair (2, 0.76) is added to the `result` dictionary.

2. For the second key-value pair (5, [3, 6, 9, 12]):
   - The key `5` is not a float, so the else block executes.
   - The key-value pair (5, [3, 6, 9, 12]) is added to the `result` dictionary.

After processing all items, the function returns the `result` dictionary, which contains the same key-value pairs as the input dictionary since none of the keys were floats.

<<<Output>>>
{2: 0.76, 5: [3, 6, 9, 12]}
