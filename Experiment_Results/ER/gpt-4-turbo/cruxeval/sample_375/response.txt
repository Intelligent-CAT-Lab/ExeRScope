<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two parameters, a and b. It checks if the substring b is present in the string a. If b is found in a, the function performs the following operations:
1. It finds the index of the first occurrence of b in a.
2. It increments this index by the length of b to skip past b.
3. It partitions the string a starting from the character immediately after b. This results in a tuple with three parts: the part before b, b itself, and the part after b.
4. It then joins these three parts using b as the separator.

For the input 'sierizam' as a and 'iz' as b:
- 'iz' is found in 'sierizam' at index 3.
- The string is partitioned from index 5 (3 + length of 'iz'), resulting in the tuple ('sier', 'iz', 'am').
- These parts are joined using 'iz' as the separator, resulting in 'sierizizam'.

If b is not found in a, the function simply returns a.

<<<Output>>>
'sierizizam'
