<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes two parameters: `cities`, which is a list of city names, and `name`, which is a string. The function processes the input based on the following conditions:
1. If `name` is empty (i.e., an empty string or `None`), it returns the list `cities` as is.
2. If `name` is not empty and it is not equal to the string 'cities', it returns an empty list.
3. If `name` is equal to 'cities', it constructs a new list by concatenating `name` with each city in the `cities` list.

In this specific call `f(['Sydney', 'Hong Kong', 'Melbourne', 'Sao Paolo', 'Istanbul', 'Boston'], 'Somewhere ')`, the `name` parameter is 'Somewhere '. Since 'Somewhere ' is neither empty nor equal to 'cities', the function will execute the second condition and return an empty list.
