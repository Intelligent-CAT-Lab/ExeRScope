<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string st as input and initializes an empty string swapped. It then iterates over each character in the string st in reverse order. For each character, it changes its case (uppercase to lowercase and vice versa) using the swapcase() method and appends it to the swapped string. Finally, it returns the swapped string.

For the input 'RTiGM':
1. The reversed order of 'RTiGM' is 'MGiTR'.
2. Iterating through 'M', 'G', 'i', 'T', 'R':
   - 'M' (uppercase) becomes 'm' (lowercase).
   - 'G' (uppercase) becomes 'g' (lowercase).
   - 'i' (lowercase) becomes 'I' (uppercase).
   - 'T' (uppercase) becomes 't' (lowercase).
   - 'R' (uppercase) becomes 'r' (lowercase).
3. Concatenating these swapped characters results in 'mgItR'.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'RTiGM' is 'mgItR'.
<<<Output>>>
'mgItR'
