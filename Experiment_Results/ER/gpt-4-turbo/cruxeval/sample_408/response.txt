<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list m as input. The first operation inside the function is to reverse the list using the reverse() method. This method modifies the list in place, meaning it changes the original list m to be in the reverse order of its elements. After reversing, the function returns the modified list.

For the input list [-4, 6, 0, 4, -7, 2, -1], the steps are as follows:
1. Original list: [-4, 6, 0, 4, -7, 2, -1]
2. After reversing: [-1, 2, -7, 4, 0, 6, -4]

Thus, the function will return the reversed list.
<<<Output>>>
[-1, 2, -7, 4, 0, 6, -4]
