The function `f` takes a list of strings `nums` as input. The first element of the list `nums[0]` is used as the width for formatting the remaining elements in the list. The formatting is done using Python's string formatting where each value `val` from `nums[1:]` (i.e., all elements of the list except the first one) is right-aligned within a string of length `nums[0]` and padded with '0' on the left if necessary.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown for the input `['1', '2', '2', '44', '0', '7', '20257']`:
1. The width for formatting is taken from `nums[0]`, which is '1'.
2. The list comprehension iterates over `nums[1:]` which is `['2', '2', '44', '0', '7', '20257']`.
3. Each element in this list is formatted to have a width of 1. Since the width is 1, elements that are single characters remain unchanged, and elements with more than one character are truncated to their last character.
   - '2' formatted with width 1 is '2'.
   - '2' formatted with width 1 is '2'.
   - '44' formatted with width 1 is '4'.
   - '0' formatted with width 1 is '0'.
   - '7' formatted with width 1 is '7'.
   - '20257' formatted with width 1 is '7'.
4. The formatted list is `['2', '2', '4', '0', '7', '7']`.
5. The function returns this list as a list of strings.

<<<Output>>>
['2', '2', '4', '0', '7', '7']
