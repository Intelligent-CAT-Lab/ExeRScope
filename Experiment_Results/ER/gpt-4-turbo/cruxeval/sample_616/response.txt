<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes a string `body` as input and performs several operations on it:
1. Converts the string into a list of characters `ls`.
2. Initializes a variable `dist` to 0, which will be used to adjust tab spaces.
3. Iterates through the list of characters, modifying each character based on certain conditions:
   - If the character two positions before the current character is a tab (`\t`), it increases `dist` by `(1 + count of tabs in the previous character) * 3`.
   - Each character in the list (except possibly the last one due to the range in the loop) is then enclosed in square brackets.
4. Joins the modified list of characters into a single string and expands tabs in the resulting string by adding `4 + dist` spaces for each tab.

For the input `'\n\ny\n'`:
- The list `ls` will be `['\n', '\n', 'y', '\n']`.
- The loop iterates with `i` values 0, 1, 2. For each iteration:
  - `i = 0`: No previous characters to check for tabs, so `dist` remains 0. `ls[0]` becomes `['\n']`.
  - `i = 1`: No tabs in previous characters, so `dist` remains 0. `ls[1]` becomes `['\n']`.
  - `i = 2`: No tabs in previous characters, so `dist` remains 0. `ls[2]` becomes `['y']`.
- The last character `'\n'` is not modified because the loop range ends before the last index.
- The final string to join is `['[\n]', '[\n]', '[y]', '\n']`.
- This list is joined to form the string `'[\n][\n][y]\n'`.
- The `expandtabs(4 + dist)` function is called with `dist` still 0, so it expands tabs by 4 spaces. However, there are no tabs in the string, so the string remains unchanged.
