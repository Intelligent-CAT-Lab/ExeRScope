<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes two parameters: `text` and `char`. It initializes `new_text` with the value of `text` and an empty list `a`. The function then enters a while loop that continues as long as `char` is in `new_text`. Inside the loop, it appends the index of `char` in `new_text` to the list `a` and then removes the first occurrence of `char` from `new_text` using `replace(char, "", 1)`.

For the input `f('rvr', 'r')`:
1. Initially, `new_text` is 'rvr' and `a` is [].
2. The character 'r' is found in `new_text` at index 0. `a` becomes [0].
3. `new_text` becomes 'vr' after replacing the first 'r'.
4. The character 'r' is found again in `new_text` at index 1 (since 'vr' has 'r' at index 1). `a` becomes [0, 1].
5. `new_text` becomes 'v' after replacing the 'r'.
6. The while loop ends as there are no more 'r's in `new_text`.

The function returns the list `a` which contains the indices where 'r' appeared in the original `new_text` before each removal.
