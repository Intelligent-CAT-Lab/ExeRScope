<<<Analysis>>>
The function `fix_spaces` is designed to replace sequences of spaces in a given string `text` with either underscores or a hyphen based on the length of the sequence. The input string for this example is "Example", which contains no spaces.

1. `new_text` is initialized as an empty string to accumulate the result.
2. Variables `i`, `start`, and `end` are initialized to 0. These are used to track the current position in the string and the start and end of sequences of spaces.
3. The function enters a while loop that iterates over each character in the input string.
4. Since there are no spaces in "Example", the condition `if text[i] == " "` is never true.
5. The `else` block executes for each character, appending each character directly to `new_text` because there are no spaces to trigger the conditions inside the `else` block.
6. After the loop, the function checks if there are any trailing spaces to handle, but since there are none, nothing additional is appended.
7. The function returns `new_text`, which is the same as the input "Example".
