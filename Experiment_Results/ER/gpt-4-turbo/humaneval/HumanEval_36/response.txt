<<<Analysis>>>
The function `fizz_buzz` takes an integer `n` as input and initializes an empty list `ns`. It then iterates over the range from 0 to `n-1` (in this case, 0 to 49). For each number `i` in this range, it checks if `i` is divisible by either 11 or 13. If true, `i` is appended to the list `ns`.

The numbers divisible by 11 within this range are 0, 11, 22, 33, 44. The numbers divisible by 13 within this range are 0, 13, 26, 39. Combining these, considering duplicates, the list `ns` becomes [0, 11, 13, 22, 26, 33, 39, 44].

Next, the list `ns` is converted to a single string `s` by mapping each integer to a string and then joining them. This results in the string '011132226333944'.

The function then initializes a variable `ans` to 0 and iterates over each character `c` in the string `s`. For each character, it checks if `c` is '7'. If true, it increments `ans` by 1. In the string '011132226333944', there are no '7's.

Finally, the function returns the value of `ans`, which counts the occurrences of the character '7' in the string `s`.
