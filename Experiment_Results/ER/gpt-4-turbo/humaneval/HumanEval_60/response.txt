<<<Analysis>>>
The function `sum_to_n` takes an integer `n` as input. In this case, `n` is set to 1.
The function calculates the sum of all integers from 0 to `n` inclusive. This is done using the `sum` function combined with `range(n + 1)`, which generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to `n`.
For `n = 1`, the `range(1 + 1)` generates the sequence [0, 1].
The sum of the sequence [0, 1] is calculated, which equals 1.
Thus, the function returns the value 1.
