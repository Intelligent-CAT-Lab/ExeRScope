<<<Analysis>>>
The function `encrypt` takes a string `s` as input and initializes a string `d` containing the alphabet. It also initializes an empty string `out` to store the result.
The function iterates over each character `c` in the input string `s`.
If `c` is a letter in `d`, it finds the index of `c` in `d`, shifts this index by 4 positions (2*2 as per the code), and takes modulo 26 to ensure it wraps around if the index exceeds the length of the alphabet. The character at this new index in `d` is then appended to `out`.
If `c` is not in `d` (e.g., a space or punctuation), it is added to `out` unchanged.
For the input 'hi':
- 'h' is found at index 7 in `d`. Shifting by 4 gives index 11, which corresponds to 'l'.
- 'i' is found at index 8 in `d`. Shifting by 4 gives index 12, which corresponds to 'm'.
Thus, the output for the input 'hi' is 'lm'.
