<<<Analysis>>>
The function `fruit_distribution` takes two parameters: a string `s` and an integer `n`. The string `s` is "5 apples and 6 oranges" and `n` is 19.
The function initializes an empty list `lis`.
It then splits the string `s` by spaces and iterates over each element. If an element is a digit, it converts it to an integer and appends it to the list `lis`.
In this case, the elements "5" and "6" are digits, so they are converted to integers and added to `lis`, making `lis` equal to [5, 6].
The function then calculates the sum of the elements in `lis`, which is 5 + 6 = 11.
Finally, it returns the result of `n - sum(lis)`, which is 19 - 11 = 8.
<<<Output>>>
