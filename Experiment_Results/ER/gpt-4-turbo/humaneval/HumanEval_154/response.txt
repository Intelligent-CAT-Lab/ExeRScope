The function `cycpattern_check` takes two strings `a` and `b` as input. The goal is to check if `b` or any cyclic permutation of `b` is a substring of `a`.

1. The length of `b` is calculated and stored in `l`, which is 3 for "xyw".
2. A new string `pat` is created by concatenating `b` with itself, resulting in "xywxyw".
3. The function then iterates over `a` with a range determined by `len(a) - l + 1`. For "xyzw", `len(a)` is 4, so the range is from 0 to 2.
4. Within this loop, another loop iterates from 0 to `l + 1` (0 to 4 in this case). This inner loop checks if the substring of `a` starting from index `i` and of length `l` matches any substring of `pat` of the same length.
5. The substrings of `a` that will be checked are "xyz" and "yzw".
6. The substrings of `pat` that will be checked are "xyw", "ywx", "wxy", and "xyw".
7. The substring "xyz" from `a` does not match any substring from `pat`.
8. The substring "yzw" from `a` does not match any substring from `pat` either.
9. Since no matching substrings are found, the function returns `False`.
