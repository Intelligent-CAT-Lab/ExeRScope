<<<Analysis>>>
The function `filter_integers` is designed to take a list of values, which can be of any type, and return a new list containing only the integers from the original list.
1. The input list is `[3, 'c', 3, 3, 'a', 'b']`.
2. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each element in the input list.
3. For each element, it checks whether the element is an instance of `int` using the `isinstance` function.
4. The elements `3`, `3`, and `3` are integers, so they pass the check and are included in the new list.
5. The elements `'c'`, `'a'`, and `'b'` are strings, so they do not pass the check and are not included in the new list.
6. The resulting list, which contains only the integers, is `[3, 3, 3]`.
7. This list is then returned by the function.

<<<Output>>>
[3, 3, 3]
