<<<Analysis>>>
The function `max_fill` takes two parameters: `grid`, which is a list of lists of integers, and `capacity`, which is an integer. The function calculates the maximum number of containers needed to fill the grid based on the given capacity.

1. The input grid is `[[0,0,1,0], [0,1,0,0], [1,1,1,1]]` and the capacity is `1`.
2. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each sub-list (row) in the grid.
3. For each row, it calculates the sum of the elements. The sums for the rows are:
   - First row: `sum([0,0,1,0]) = 1`
   - Second row: `sum([0,1,0,0]) = 1`
   - Third row: `sum([1,1,1,1]) = 4`
4. Each sum is then divided by the capacity and rounded up to the nearest whole number using `math.ceil`. This represents the number of containers needed for each row:
   - First row: `math.ceil(1/1) = 1`
   - Second row: `math.ceil(1/1) = 1`
   - Third row: `math.ceil(4/1) = 4`
5. The results from each row are summed together to get the total number of containers needed:
   - Total containers = `1 + 1 + 4 = 6`
6. The function returns this total, which is `6`.
