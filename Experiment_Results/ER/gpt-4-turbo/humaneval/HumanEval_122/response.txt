<<<Analysis>>>
The function `add_elements` takes two parameters: `arr`, which is a list of integers, and `k`, which specifies the number of elements from the start of the list to consider for processing. The function returns the sum of elements from the beginning of the list up to the k-th element, but only includes those elements in the sum if the number of digits in the integer (including the negative sign for negative numbers) is less than or equal to 2.

In this specific call `add_elements([1,-2,-3,41,57,76,87,88,99], 3)`, the function will consider the first 3 elements of the list, which are `[1, -2, -3]`.

1. The integer `1` has 1 digit, which is less than or equal to 2, so it is included in the sum.
2. The integer `-2` has 2 digits (including the negative sign), which is less than or equal to 2, so it is included in the sum.
3. The integer `-3` also has 2 digits (including the negative sign), which is less than or equal to 2, so it is included in the sum.

The sum of these numbers is `1 + (-2) + (-3) = -4`.

<<<Output>>>
-4
