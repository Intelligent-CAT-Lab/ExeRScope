<<<Analysis>>>
The function `filter_by_prefix` is designed to filter a list of strings, returning only those that start with a specified prefix. The input parameters are an empty list `[]` and the prefix `'john'`.
The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each string in the list and checks if it starts with the prefix using the `startswith` method.
Since the input list is empty, the list comprehension has no elements to iterate over.
Therefore, the function immediately returns an empty list as there are no strings to check against the prefix.
