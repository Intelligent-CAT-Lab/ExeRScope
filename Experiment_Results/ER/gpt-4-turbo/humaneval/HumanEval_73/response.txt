The function `smallest_change` is designed to determine the minimum number of changes required to make an array symmetric. The input array is `[1, 2, 3, 5, 4, 7, 9, 6]`.

1. The variable `ans` is initialized to 0. This variable will count the number of changes needed.
2. The function uses a loop to iterate over the first half of the array (up to the middle element if the array length is odd, or up to the element before the middle if even). The length of the array is 8, so the loop will iterate from index 0 to index 3.
3. In each iteration, the function compares the element at index `i` with the element at index `len(arr) - i - 1` (the corresponding element from the end of the array moving towards the middle).
   - For `i = 0`, it compares `arr[0]` (1) with `arr[7]` (6). They are different, so `ans` is incremented by 1.
   - For `i = 1`, it compares `arr[1]` (2) with `arr[6]` (9). They are different, so `ans` is incremented by 1.
   - For `i = 2`, it compares `arr[2]` (3) with `arr[5]` (7). They are different, so `ans` is incremented by 1.
   - For `i = 3`, it compares `arr[3]` (5) with `arr[4]` (4). They are different, so `ans` is incremented by 1.
4. After the loop, the function returns the value of `ans`, which is now 4.

The function concludes that 4 changes are needed to make the array symmetric.
