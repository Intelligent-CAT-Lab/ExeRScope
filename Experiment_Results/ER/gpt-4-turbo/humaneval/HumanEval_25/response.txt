The function `factorize` is designed to return the prime factorization of the integer `n`. Here, `n` is initialized to 2.
The function starts by importing the `math` module and initializing an empty list `fact` to store the factors.
The variable `i` is initialized to 2, which is the smallest prime number.
The while loop runs as long as `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `n` plus 1. For `n = 2`, `math.sqrt(2) + 1` is approximately 2.414. Thus, the loop condition `i <= 2.414` is true when `i` is 2.
Inside the loop, the code checks if `n % i == 0`. Since `2 % 2 == 0`, the condition is true.
The factor 2 is appended to the list `fact`, and `n` is updated to `n // i`, which results in `n` becoming 1.
The loop condition is checked again, but now `i` is still 2, and `n` is 1, so `i <= int(math.sqrt(1) + 1)` is false, and the loop exits.
After the loop, there is a check if `n > 1`. Since `n` is 1, this condition is false, and no further factors are added.
The function returns the list `fact`, which contains the single element [2], representing the prime factorization of 2.
