<<<Analysis>>>
The function `check_if_last_char_is_a_letter` takes a string `txt` as input. In this case, the input is "apple".
1. The function splits the input string by spaces using `txt.split(' ')`. Since "apple" does not contain any spaces, the result of the split operation is a list containing one element: `['apple']`.
2. The function then retrieves the last element of this list using `[-1]`, which is "apple".
3. It checks if the length of this last element is 1 and if its ASCII value (after converting to lowercase) is between 97 ('a') and 122 ('z'). 
4. The length of "apple" is 5, not 1, so the condition `len(check) == 1` is false.
5. Since the first condition is false, the function does not proceed to check the ASCII range and directly returns `False`.
