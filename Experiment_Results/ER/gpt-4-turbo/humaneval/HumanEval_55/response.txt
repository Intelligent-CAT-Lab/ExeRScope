The function `fib` is a recursive implementation of the Fibonacci sequence. The Fibonacci sequence is defined such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. 

Here's how the function works for `fib(10)`:
1. `fib(10)` calls `fib(9)` and `fib(8)`.
2. `fib(9)` calls `fib(8)` and `fib(7)`.
3. This pattern continues, breaking down each function call into smaller calls until it reaches the base cases `fib(1)` and `fib(0)`.
4. `fib(1)` returns 1 and `fib(0)` returns 0.
5. These base cases start the process of summing up through the recursive calls:
   - `fib(2)` is calculated as `fib(1) + fib(0) = 1 + 0 = 1`
   - `fib(3)` is `fib(2) + fib(1) = 1 + 1 = 2`
   - `fib(4)` is `fib(3) + fib(2) = 2 + 1 = 3`
   - `fib(5)` is `fib(4) + fib(3) = 3 + 2 = 5`
   - `fib(6)` is `fib(5) + fib(4) = 5 + 3 = 8`
   - `fib(7)` is `fib(6) + fib(5) = 8 + 5 = 13`
   - `fib(8)` is `fib(7) + fib(6) = 13 + 8 = 21`
   - `fib(9)` is `fib(8) + fib(7) = 21 + 13 = 34`
   - Finally, `fib(10)` is `fib(9) + fib(8) = 34 + 21 = 55`

Thus, the result of `fib(10)` is 55.
