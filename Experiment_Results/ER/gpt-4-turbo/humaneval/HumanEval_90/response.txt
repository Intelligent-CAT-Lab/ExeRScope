<<<Analysis>>>
The function `next_smallest` takes a list `lst` as input. The first operation inside the function is to convert the list into a set to remove any duplicates, and then sort it. This sorted set is reassigned to `lst`.
The function then checks if the length of `lst` is less than 2. If it is, the function returns `None` because there is no second smallest element in a list with less than two unique elements.
In this specific case, the input list is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`. After converting to a set and sorting, the list remains `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` because there are no duplicates and it is already in ascending order.
Since the length of the list is 5, which is greater than 2, the function proceeds to return the second element of the list, which is `2`.
