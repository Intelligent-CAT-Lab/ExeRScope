<<<Analysis>>>
The function `compare` takes two lists, `game` and `guess`, as input. It returns a new list that contains the absolute differences between corresponding elements of the `game` and `guess` lists.
The input lists are `[1,2,3,4,5,1]` and `[1,2,3,4,2,-2]`.
The function uses the `zip` function to pair elements from both lists and iterates over these pairs:
1. Pair (1,1) results in an absolute difference of 0.
2. Pair (2,2) results in an absolute difference of 0.
3. Pair (3,3) results in an absolute difference of 0.
4. Pair (4,4) results in an absolute difference of 0.
5. Pair (5,2) results in an absolute difference of 3.
6. Pair (1,-2) results in an absolute difference of 3.

The function then returns the list of these differences: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3]`.
<<<Output>>>
[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3]
