<<<Analysis>>>
The function `maximum` takes two parameters: `arr`, which is a list of integers, and `k`, which is an integer specifying the number of maximum elements to return from the list.
1. The input list `arr` is `[-3, -4, 5]` and `k` is `3`.
2. The function first checks if `k` is `0`. If `k` were `0`, it would return an empty list, but since `k` is `3`, it proceeds to the next step.
3. The list `arr` is sorted. The sorted version of `[-3, -4, 5]` is `[-4, -3, 5]`.
4. The function then retrieves the last `k` elements from the sorted list. Since `k` is `3`, it takes the last three elements, which are all the elements of the sorted list: `[-4, -3, 5]`.
5. The function returns this list as the result.

<<<Output>>>
[-4, -3, 5]
