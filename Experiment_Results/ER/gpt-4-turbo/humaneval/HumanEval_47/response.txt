<<<Analysis>>>
The function `median` is designed to calculate the median of a list of numbers. The input list provided is `[3, 1, 2, 4, 5]`.
1. The list is first sorted, resulting in `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
2. The function then checks the length of the list, which is 5. Since 5 is an odd number, the code proceeds to find the median for an odd-length list.
3. The median for an odd-length list is the middle element, which is found using `l[len(l) // 2]`. Here, `len(l) // 2` evaluates to `5 // 2` which is `2`.
4. The element at index 2 in the sorted list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` is `3`.
5. Therefore, the median of the list `[3, 1, 2, 4, 5]` is `3`.
