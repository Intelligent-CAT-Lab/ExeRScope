<<<Analysis>>>
The function `eat` takes three parameters: `number`, `need`, and `remaining`. It checks if the `need` is less than or equal to `remaining`. If true, it returns a list where the first element is `number + need` and the second element is `remaining - need`. If false, it returns a list where the first element is `number + remaining` and the second element is 0.

In the given call `eat(5, 6, 10)`, the parameters are:
- `number = 5`
- `need = 6`
- `remaining = 10`

Since `need` (6) is less than `remaining` (10), the condition `need <= remaining` is true. Therefore, the function will execute the first return statement:
- The new `number` will be `5 + 6 = 11`
- The new `remaining` will be `10 - 6 = 4`

Thus, the function returns `[11, 4]`.
