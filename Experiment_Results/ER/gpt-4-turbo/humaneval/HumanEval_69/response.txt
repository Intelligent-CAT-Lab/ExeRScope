The function `search` takes a list `lst` as input. The list provided in the question is `[5, 5, 5, 5, 1]`.

1. The function first creates a frequency list `frq` of size `max(lst) + 1` which is `5 + 1 = 6`. Thus, `frq` is initialized as `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.

2. The function then iterates over each element in `lst` to populate the `frq` list with the count of each number. After processing the list `[5, 5, 5, 5, 1]`, the `frq` list becomes `[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 4]`. Here, `frq[1] = 1` (one occurrence of 1) and `frq[5] = 4` (four occurrences of 5).

3. The function initializes `ans` to -1. It then iterates over the `frq` list starting from index 1 (ignoring index 0 as it doesn't represent any number from the list). The goal is to find the largest index `i` where `frq[i]` (the frequency of the number `i`) is greater than or equal to `i`.

4. During the iteration:
   - At `i = 1`, `frq[1] = 1` which is equal to 1. So, `ans` is updated to 1.
   - At `i = 2`, `frq[2] = 0` which is less than 2. `ans` remains 1.
   - At `i = 3`, `frq[3] = 0` which is less than 3. `ans` remains 1.
   - At `i = 4`, `frq[4] = 0` which is less than 4. `ans` remains 1.
   - At `i = 5`, `frq[5] = 4` which is less than 5. `ans` remains 1.

5. The loop completes and the function returns the value of `ans`, which is 1.
