<<<Analysis>>>
The function `circular_shift` takes two parameters: `x`, which is an integer, and `shift`, which is the number of positions to shift the digits of `x`.
1. The integer `x` is converted to a string `s`, so for `x = 100`, `s` becomes '100'.
2. The function checks if `shift` is greater than the length of `s`. In this case, `shift = 2` and the length of `s` is 3, so the condition is false.
3. Since the condition is false, the function performs a circular shift. It takes the last `shift` characters of `s` and places them at the beginning, followed by the rest of the string up to `len(s) - shift`.
   - `s[len(s) - shift:]` extracts the last `shift` characters: `s[3 - 2:]` which is `s[1:]` equals '00'.
   - `s[:len(s) - shift]` extracts the beginning of the string up to `len(s) - shift`: `s[:3 - 2]` which is `s[:1]` equals '1'.
   - Concatenating these gives '001'.
4. The function returns '001'.
