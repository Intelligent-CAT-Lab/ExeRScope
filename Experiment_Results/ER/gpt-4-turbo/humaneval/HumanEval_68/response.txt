<<<Analysis>>>
The function `pluck` takes an array `arr` as input. The input array for this example is `[4, 2, 3]`.
1. The function first checks if the array is empty. If it is, it returns an empty list. In this case, the array is not empty.
2. Next, the function uses a filter to create a list of even numbers from the array. The lambda function `lambda x: x%2 == 0` checks if a number is even. The even numbers from the array `[4, 2, 3]` are `[4, 2]`.
3. The function then checks if the list of even numbers is empty. If it is, it returns an empty list. In this case, the list of even numbers is `[4, 2]`, which is not empty.
4. The function proceeds to find the minimum value in the list of even numbers using `min(evens)`, which is `2`.
5. It then finds the index of this minimum value in the original array using `arr.index(min(evens))`. The index of `2` in `[4, 2, 3]` is `1`.
6. Finally, the function returns a list containing the minimum even number and its index in the original array, which is `[2, 1]`.

<<<Output>>>
[2, 1]
