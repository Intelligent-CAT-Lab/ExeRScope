<<<Analysis>>>
The function `is_equal_to_sum_even` takes an integer `n` as input. It checks two conditions:
1. `n % 2 == 0` - This checks if `n` is an even number.
2. `n >= 8` - This checks if `n` is greater than or equal to 8.

Both conditions must be true for the function to return `True`. If either condition is false, the function returns `False`.

For the input `n = 4`:
- The first condition `n % 2 == 0` is true because 4 is an even number.
- The second condition `n >= 8` is false because 4 is less than 8.

Since one of the conditions is false, the function will return `False`.
