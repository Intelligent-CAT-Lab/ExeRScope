<<<Analysis>>>
The function `add` is defined to take two parameters, `x` and `y`, both of which are expected to be integers. The function simply returns the sum of `x` and `y`.
In the call `add(0, 1)`, the values of `x` and `y` are 0 and 1, respectively. The function computes the sum of these two values, which is `0 + 1 = 1`.
