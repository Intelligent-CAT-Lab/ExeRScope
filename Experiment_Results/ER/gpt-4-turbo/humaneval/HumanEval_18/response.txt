<<<Analysis>>>
The function `how_many_times` is designed to count how many times a substring appears in a given string. The input parameters are an empty string (`string = ''`) and a substring (`substring = 'x'`).

1. The variable `times` is initialized to 0, which will keep track of the number of times the substring is found in the string.
2. The function then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to `len(string) - len(substring) + 1`. Since `len(string)` is 0 (because the string is empty) and `len(substring)` is 1, the range for the loop is from 0 to `0 - 1 + 1 = 0`.
3. The loop condition is `range(0)`, which means the loop does not execute at all because the range is empty.
4. Since the loop does not execute, the variable `times` remains 0.
5. The function returns the value of `times`, which is 0.

Thus, the function returns 0 as the substring 'x' cannot be found in an empty string.
