<<<Analysis>>>
The function `prime_length` is designed to determine if the length of a given string is a prime number. The input string in this case is 'Hello'.
1. The length of the string 'Hello' is calculated to be 5.
2. The function checks if the length is 0 or 1, which it is not, so it proceeds.
3. A loop then checks for factors of the length (5) from 2 up to but not including the length itself. It checks if 5 is divisible by 2, 3, or 4.
4. Since 5 is not divisible by any of these numbers, the loop completes without returning False.
5. The function then returns True, indicating that the length of the string is a prime number.

<<<Output>>>
True
