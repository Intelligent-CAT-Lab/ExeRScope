<<<Analysis>>>
The function `same_chars` takes two string inputs, `s0` and `s1`. It converts each string into a set of characters, which removes any duplicate characters and only retains unique ones. The function then compares these two sets using the equality operator `==`.

For the input strings 'eabcdzzzz' and 'dddzzzzzzzddeddabc':
- The set of 'eabcdzzzz' is {'e', 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'z'}.
- The set of 'dddzzzzzzzddeddabc' is also {'e', 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'z'}.

Since both sets contain the same characters, the comparison of these sets will return `True`.

<<<Output>>>
True
