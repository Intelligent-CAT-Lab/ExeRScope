<<<Analysis>>>
The function `minSubArraySum` is designed to find the minimum sum of a subarray in the given list `nums`. The input list is `[2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 4]`.

1. Initialize `max_sum` to 0 and `s` to 0. These variables will be used to find the maximum sum of the negated values of subarrays.
2. Iterate through each number in `nums`:
   - For each number, subtract it from 0 and add to `s`.
   - If `s` becomes negative, reset `s` to 0.
   - Update `max_sum` to be the maximum of `s` and `max_sum`.
   - Iteration steps:
     - num = 2, s = -2, max_sum = 0 (since -2 < 0, reset s to 0)
     - num = 3, s = -3, max_sum = 0 (since -3 < 0, reset s to 0)
     - num = 4, s = -4, max_sum = 0 (since -4 < 0, reset s to 0)
     - num = 1, s = -1, max_sum = 0 (since -1 < 0, reset s to 0)
     - num = 2, s = -2, max_sum = 0 (since -2 < 0, reset s to 0)
     - num = 4, s = -4, max_sum = 0 (since -4 < 0, reset s to 0)
3. After the loop, since `max_sum` is still 0, find the maximum of the negated values of `nums` which is `-min(nums)`. The minimum value in `nums` is 1, so `-min(nums)` is -1.
4. Finally, `min_sum` is the negation of `max_sum`, which is -(-1) = 1.

The function returns the minimum sum of any subarray, which is 1 in this case.
