<<<Analysis>>>
The function `is_multiply_prime(a)` checks if the number `a` can be expressed as the product of three distinct prime numbers. The input `a` is set to 5.

1. The function `is_prime(n)` is defined to check if a number `n` is prime. It returns `True` if `n` is prime, otherwise `False`.

2. The outer function `is_multiply_prime(a)` iterates over three nested loops, each ranging from 2 to 100, representing potential prime numbers `i`, `j`, and `k`.

3. For each combination of `i`, `j`, and `k`, the function first checks if all three numbers are prime using the `is_prime` function. If any of `i`, `j`, or `k` is not prime, it skips to the next iteration.

4. If all three numbers are prime, it then checks if the product of `i`, `j`, and `k` equals `a`. If it does, the function returns `True`.

5. For the input `a = 5`, the smallest product of three distinct primes is `2*2*3 = 12` (since `2` is the smallest prime and the next smallest distinct primes are `3`). Since `12` is already greater than `5`, there is no possible way for three distinct primes to multiply to `5`.

6. After checking all possible combinations and not finding any that equal `5`, the function returns `False`.
