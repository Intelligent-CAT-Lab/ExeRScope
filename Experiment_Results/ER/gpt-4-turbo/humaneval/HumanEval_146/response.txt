<<<Analysis>>>
The function `specialFilter` is designed to count numbers from a list that are greater than 10 and have both the first and last digits as odd numbers. The odd digits are defined in the tuple `odd_digits`.

The input list is `[5, -2, 1, -5]`. The function initializes `count` to 0 and iterates through each number in the list:
1. `5` is not greater than 10.
2. `-2` is not greater than 10.
3. `1` is not greater than 10.
4. `-5` is not greater than 10.

None of the numbers in the list satisfy the condition of being greater than 10. Therefore, the loop completes without incrementing `count`.

The function returns the value of `count`, which remains 0.
