<<<Analysis>>>
The function `max_element` is designed to find the maximum element in a list. The input list provided is `[1, 2, 3]`.
1. The variable `m` is initialized to the first element of the list, which is `1`.
2. The function then enters a loop that iterates over each element `e` in the list.
3. In the first iteration, `e` is `1`, which is not greater than `m` (`1`), so `m` remains `1`.
4. In the second iteration, `e` is `2`, which is greater than `m` (`1`), so `m` is updated to `2`.
5. In the third iteration, `e` is `3`, which is greater than `m` (`2`), so `m` is updated to `3`.
6. After completing the loop, the function returns the value of `m`, which is now `3`, as it is the maximum value found in the list.
