<<<Analysis>>>
The function `iscube` takes an integer `a` as input. The first step in the function is to take the absolute value of `a`, which ensures that the function works correctly for negative numbers as well. Since the input is 1, the absolute value of 1 is still 1.

Next, the function calculates the cube root of the absolute value of `a`. This is done by raising `a` to the power of `(1. / 3)`, which is equivalent to taking the cube root. For the input 1, the cube root of 1 is 1.0.

The result of the cube root calculation is then rounded to the nearest integer using the `round` function. For the input 1, rounding 1.0 gives 1.

After rounding, the function checks if the cube of this rounded integer equals the original absolute value of `a`. This is done by raising the rounded integer (1) to the power of 3, which results in 1. Since 1 equals the absolute value of `a` (which is also 1), the condition `int(round(a ** (1. / 3))) ** 3 == a` is true.

Therefore, the function returns `True` for the input 1.
