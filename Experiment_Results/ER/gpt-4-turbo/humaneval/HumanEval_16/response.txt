<<<Analysis>>>
The function `count_distinct_characters` takes a single string argument and returns the number of distinct characters in the string, ignoring case differences.
The input string is the concatenation of 'abcde', 'cade', and 'CADE', resulting in 'abcdecadeCADE'.
The function converts the entire string to lowercase, resulting in 'abcdecadecade'.
It then converts this string into a set, which automatically removes any duplicate characters. The resulting set from the string 'abcdecadecade' is {'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'}.
The length of this set is 5, as there are five unique characters.
Thus, the function returns 5.
<<<Output>>>
5
