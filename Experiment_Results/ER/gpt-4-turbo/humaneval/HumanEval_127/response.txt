<<<Analysis>>>
The function `intersection` takes two intervals as input, `interval1` and `interval2`. Each interval is represented as a tuple with two elements, where the first element is the start of the interval and the second is the end.

1. The function first calculates the maximum of the start points of both intervals using `max(interval1[0], interval2[0])`. For the intervals (1, 2) and (2, 3), the maximum start point is 2.
2. Next, it calculates the minimum of the end points of both intervals using `min(interval1[1], interval2[1])`. For the intervals (1, 2) and (2, 3), the minimum end point is 2.
3. The length of the intersection of the intervals is then calculated as `r - l`, which in this case is `2 - 2 = 0`.
4. The function `is_prime` is used to check if this length (0) is a prime number. The `is_prime` function returns `False` for 0 because 0 is not a prime number.
5. Since the length of the intersection is not a prime number, the function `intersection` returns "NO".
