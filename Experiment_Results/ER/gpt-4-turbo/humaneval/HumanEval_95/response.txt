<<<Analysis>>>
The function `check_dict_case` is designed to check if all the keys in a dictionary are either all uppercase or all lowercase. It returns `True` if they are consistent in case, and `False` otherwise.

1. The input dictionary is `{"p":"pineapple", "b":"banana"}`.
2. The function first checks if the dictionary is empty. In this case, it is not empty, so it proceeds.
3. The variable `state` is initialized to "start".
4. The function then iterates over the keys of the dictionary. The keys in this case are "p" and "b".
5. For the first key "p":
   - It checks if the key is a string, which it is.
   - Since `state` is "start", it checks if "p" is uppercase or lowercase. "p" is lowercase, so `state` is set to "lower".
6. For the next key "b":
   - It checks if "b" is a string, which it is.
   - Since `state` is "lower", it checks if "b" is also lowercase. "b" is lowercase, so `state` remains "lower".
7. After iterating through all keys, the function checks if `state` is either "upper" or "lower". Since `state` is "lower", the function returns `True`.
