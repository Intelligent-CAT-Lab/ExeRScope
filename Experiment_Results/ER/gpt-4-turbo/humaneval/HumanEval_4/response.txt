<<<Analysis>>>
The function `mean_absolute_deviation` is designed to calculate the mean absolute deviation of a list of numbers. The input list provided is `[1.0, 2.0, 3.0]`.

1. First, the function calculates the mean of the numbers. The mean is calculated as:
   \[
   \text{mean} = \frac{\text{sum of numbers}}{\text{number of elements}} = \frac{1.0 + 2.0 + 3.0}{3} = 2.0
   \]

2. Next, the function calculates the mean absolute deviation. This is done by computing the absolute difference between each number in the list and the mean, then averaging these absolute differences:
   - For 1.0: \( |1.0 - 2.0| = 1.0 \)
   - For 2.0: \( |2.0 - 2.0| = 0.0 \)
   - For 3.0: \( |3.0 - 2.0| = 1.0 \)

   The sum of these absolute differences is \(1.0 + 0.0 + 1.0 = 2.0\).

3. Finally, the mean absolute deviation is calculated as:
   \[
   \text{mean absolute deviation} = \frac{\text{sum of absolute differences}}{\text{number of elements}} = \frac{2.0}{3} \approx 0.6667
   \]

Thus, the function returns approximately 0.6667.
