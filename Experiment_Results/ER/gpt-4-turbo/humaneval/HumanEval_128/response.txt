<<<Analysis>>>
The function `prod_signs` takes a list `arr` as input. The input list for this example is `[1, 2, 2, -4]`.
1. The function first checks if the list is empty. If it is, it returns `None`. In this case, the list is not empty.
2. Next, it checks if `0` is in the list. If `0` is found, `prod` is set to `0`. In this case, there is no `0` in the list.
3. The function then calculates the number of negative numbers in the list using a filter and lambda function. For the list `[1, 2, 2, -4]`, there is one negative number (`-4`).
4. The variable `prod` is set to `(-1) ** 1` (since there is one negative number), which equals `-1`.
5. The function then calculates the sum of the absolute values of the elements in the list. The absolute values are `[1, 2, 2, 4]`, and their sum is `9`.
6. Finally, the function returns the product of `prod` and the sum of absolute values, which is `-1 * 9 = -9`.

<<<Output>>>
-9
