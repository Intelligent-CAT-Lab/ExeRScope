<<<Analysis>>>
The function `triangle_area` takes two parameters, `a` and `h`, which represent the base and height of a triangle, respectively. The parameters are set to 5 and 3 in this case.
The function calculates the area of the triangle using the formula for the area of a triangle: (base * height) / 2. 
Thus, the calculation performed is (5 * 3) / 2.0, which equals 15 / 2.0.
The division by 2.0 ensures that the result is a floating-point number.
The final computed area of the triangle is 7.5.
<<<Output>>>
7.5
