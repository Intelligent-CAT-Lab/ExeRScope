<<<Analysis>>>
The function `do_algebra` takes two parameters: `operator`, a list of string operators, and `operand`, a list of numbers. The function constructs a mathematical expression as a string using these lists.
1. The initial value of `expression` is set to the string representation of the first element in `operand`, which is `2`.
2. The function then iterates over the `operator` list and the remaining elements of the `operand` list simultaneously using `zip`.
3. In the first iteration, the operator is '**' (exponentiation) and the operand is `3`. The expression becomes '2**3'.
4. In the second iteration, the operator is '*' (multiplication) and the operand is `4`. The expression updates to '2**3*4'.
5. In the third iteration, the operator is '+' (addition) and the operand is `5`. The expression updates to '2**3*4+5'.
6. The final expression '2**3*4+5' is evaluated using the `eval` function. This calculates as follows:
   - 2**3 = 8
   - 8*4 = 32
   - 32+5 = 37
7. The function returns the result of the evaluated expression, which is `37`.
