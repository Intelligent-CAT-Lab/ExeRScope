<<<Analysis>>>
The function `filter_by_substring` is designed to filter a list of strings, returning only those strings that contain a specified substring. The input parameters are an empty list `[]` and the substring `'john'`.

The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each string in the list. For each string `x`, it checks if the substring `'john'` is present in `x`. If it is, `x` is included in the output list.

Since the input list is empty, there are no strings to check against the substring `'john'`. Therefore, the list comprehension iterates over an empty list and immediately returns an empty list as there are no elements to process.
