<<<Analysis>>>
The function `match_parens` takes a list of two strings and checks if any permutation of concatenating these strings results in a string with matching parentheses. The function `check` is used to determine if a given string has matching parentheses.

1. The input list is `['()(', ')']`.
2. The function concatenates the strings in two possible orders:
   - S1 = lst[0] + lst[1] = '()(' + ')' = '()()'
   - S2 = lst[1] + lst[0] = ')' + '()(' = ')()('
3. The function `check` is then used to validate each concatenated string:
   - For S1 = '()()':
     - Initialize `val` to 0.
     - Iterate through each character:
       - '(' increments `val` to 1.
       - ')' decrements `val` to 0.
       - '(' increments `val` to 1.
       - ')' decrements `val` to 0.
     - After the loop, `val` is 0, indicating balanced parentheses.
   - For S2 = ')()(':
     - Initialize `val` to 0.
     - Iterate through each character:
       - ')' decrements `val` to -1 (unbalanced at this point).
       - '(' increments `val` to 0.
       - ')' decrements `val` to -1.
       - '(' increments `val` to 0.
     - After the loop, `val` is 0, but it was negative during the iteration, indicating unbalanced parentheses.
4. Since S1 is balanced, the function returns 'Yes'.
