<<<Analysis>>>
The function `valid_date` is designed to validate a date string formatted as 'MM-DD-YYYY'. The input date string '03-11-2000' is passed to the function.
1. The function first strips any leading or trailing whitespace from the date string, though in this case, there are none.
2. It then splits the date string into three parts: month, day, and year using the '-' delimiter. This results in month='03', day='11', and year='2000'.
3. These string values are converted to integers: month=3, day=11, year=2000.
4. The function checks if the month value is valid (between 1 and 12). For month=3, this condition is true.
5. It then checks if the day value is valid for the given month. March (month 3) has 31 days, so the function checks if day is between 1 and 31. For day=11, this condition is true.
6. Since all conditions are met without any exceptions or errors, the function returns True, indicating that '03-11-2000' is a valid date.
