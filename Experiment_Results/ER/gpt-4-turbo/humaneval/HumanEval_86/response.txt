<<<Analysis>>>
The function `anti_shuffle` takes a string `s` as input. The input string 'Hi' is passed to the function.
The function first splits the string `s` by spaces using `s.split(' ')`. Since 'Hi' does not contain any spaces, the result of the split operation is a list containing the single element ['Hi'].
Next, the function uses a list comprehension to process each element of the list. For each element `i` in the list, it converts `i` into a list of characters, sorts this list, and then joins the sorted characters back into a string.
For the string 'Hi', converting to a list of characters gives ['H', 'i'], which when sorted lexicographically (considering ASCII values) results in ['H', 'i'] because 'H' (ASCII 72) comes before 'i' (ASCII 105).
The sorted list of characters is then joined back into the string 'Hi'.
Finally, the function joins all processed strings (in this case, just one) with spaces in between, resulting in the final output 'Hi'.

Hi
