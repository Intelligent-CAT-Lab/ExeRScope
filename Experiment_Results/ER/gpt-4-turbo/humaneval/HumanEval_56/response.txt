<<<Analysis>>>
The function `correct_bracketing` is designed to check if the string of brackets is correctly nested using '<' and '>' characters. The input string is "<<><>>".

1. The function initializes a variable `depth` to 0, which will track the nesting level of the brackets.
2. The function iterates over each character in the input string:
   - For the first character '<', `depth` is incremented to 1.
   - For the second character '<', `depth` is incremented to 2.
   - For the third character '>', `depth` is decremented to 1.
   - For the fourth character '<', `depth` is incremented back to 2.
   - For the fifth character '>', `depth` is decremented to 1.
   - For the sixth character '>', `depth` is decremented to 0.
3. After processing all characters, the function checks if `depth` equals 0, which would indicate that all brackets are correctly closed and nested.
4. Since `depth` is 0, the function returns `True`, indicating that the bracket string is correctly nested.
