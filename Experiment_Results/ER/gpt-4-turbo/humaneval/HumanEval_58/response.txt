<<<Analysis>>>
The function `common` takes two lists, `l1` and `l2`, as input. It initializes an empty set `ret` to store common elements found in both lists.
The function uses nested loops to compare each element `e1` from `l1` with each element `e2` from `l2`. If `e1` equals `e2`, it adds `e1` to the set `ret`. Using a set ensures that duplicates are not added.
For the given input lists `l1 = [1, 4, 3, 34, 653, 2, 5]` and `l2 = [5, 7, 1, 5, 9, 653, 121]`, the function compares:
- `1` from `l1` is found in `l2`.
- `5` from `l1` is found in `l2`.
- `653` from `l1` is found in `l2`.
These elements are added to the set `ret`.
After all comparisons, the set `ret` contains `{1, 653, 5}`.
The function then converts the set to a list and returns it sorted. The sorted list is `[1, 5, 653]`.
<<<Output>>>
[1, 5, 653]
