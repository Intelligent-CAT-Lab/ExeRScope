<<<Analysis>>>
The function `encode` is designed to modify a given message by swapping the case of all characters and then replacing vowels with the character that is two positions ahead in the ASCII table.

1. The input message is 'TEST'.
2. The `vowels` string contains all lowercase and uppercase vowels.
3. A dictionary `vowels_replace` is created where each vowel is mapped to a character that is two positions ahead in the ASCII table. For example, 'a' becomes 'c', 'A' becomes 'C', etc.
4. The message is then converted to its opposite case using `swapcase()`, resulting in 'test'.
5. The function iterates over each character in 'test'. Since none of these characters are vowels, the replacement does not occur.
6. The final result is the swapped case version of the original message, which is 'test'.

<<<Output>>>
