<<<Analysis>>>
The function `even_odd_palindrome` takes an integer `n` and returns a tuple containing counts of even and odd palindromic numbers up to `n`. The function `is_palindrome` checks if a number is a palindrome by comparing the string representation of the number with its reverse.

Here's the step-by-step analysis for `even_odd_palindrome(123)`:
1. Initialize `even_palindrome_count` and `odd_palindrome_count` to 0.
2. Loop through numbers from 1 to 123.
3. For each number `i`, check if it is a palindrome using the `is_palindrome` function.
4. If `i` is a palindrome and odd (`i % 2 == 1`), increment `odd_palindrome_count`.
5. If `i` is a palindrome and even (`i % 2 == 0`), increment `even_palindrome_count`.
6. Palindromic numbers from 1 to 123 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, 99, 101, 111, 121.
7. Among these, the even palindromes are: 2, 4, 6, 8, 22, 44, 66, 88.
8. The odd palindromes are: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 33, 55, 77, 99, 101, 111, 121.
9. Count of even palindromes is 8 and odd palindromes is 13.
