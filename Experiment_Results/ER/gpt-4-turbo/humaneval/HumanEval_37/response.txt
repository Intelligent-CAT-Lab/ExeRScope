The function `sort_even` takes a list `l` as input. In this case, the input list is `[1, 2, 3]`.
1. The function first extracts elements at even indices (0-based) into the list `evens` and elements at odd indices into the list `odds`. For the input `[1, 2, 3]`, `evens` will be `[1, 3]` and `odds` will be `[2]`.
2. Both `evens` and `odds` are sorted. After sorting, `evens` remains `[1, 3]` and `odds` remains `[2]`.
3. An empty list `ans` is initialized.
4. The function then uses a `zip` function to iterate over pairs of elements from `evens` and `odds`. For each pair `(e, o)`, it extends `ans` by adding both `e` and `o`. In this case, the pair `(1, 2)` is processed, resulting in `ans` becoming `[1, 2]`.
5. After the loop, the function checks if there are more elements in `evens` than in `odds`. If so, it appends the last element of `evens` to `ans`. In this case, `evens` has one more element (`3`), so `3` is appended to `ans`.
6. The final list `ans` is `[1, 2, 3]`.
7. The function returns `ans`, and since the question asks for the return value as a tuple, the final output is converted to a tuple.
