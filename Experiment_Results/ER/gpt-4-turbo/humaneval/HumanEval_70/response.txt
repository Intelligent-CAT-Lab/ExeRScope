<<<Analysis>>>
The function `strange_sort_list` takes a list `lst` as input. It initializes an empty list `res` and a boolean variable `switch` set to True. The function then enters a while loop that continues as long as `lst` is not empty.

1. In the first iteration, since `switch` is True, the function appends the minimum value of `lst` (which is 1) to `res` and removes this value from `lst`. The list `lst` becomes [2, 3, 4] and `switch` is toggled to False.

2. In the second iteration, `switch` is now False, so the function appends the maximum value of `lst` (which is 4) to `res` and removes this value from `lst`. The list `lst` becomes [2, 3] and `switch` is toggled to True.

3. In the third iteration, `switch` is True, so the function appends the minimum value of `lst` (which is 2) to `res` and removes this value from `lst`. The list `lst` becomes [3] and `switch` is toggled to False.

4. In the fourth iteration, `switch` is False, so the function appends the maximum value of `lst` (which is 3) to `res` and removes this value from `lst`. The list `lst` becomes empty and the loop ends.

The final result list `res` is [1, 4, 2, 3].
