<<<Analysis>>>
The function `sort_numbers` takes a single string input `numbers` which contains space-separated English words for digits. The input for this example is 'five zero four seven nine eight'.

1. A dictionary `value_map` is defined to map the English words for digits to their corresponding numerical values.
2. The function processes the input string by splitting it into individual words using `numbers.split(' ')`. This results in a list of words: ['five', 'zero', 'four', 'seven', 'nine', 'eight'].
3. A list comprehension is used to filter out any empty strings from the list, though in this case, there are none.
4. The list of words is then sorted based on their numerical values, which are retrieved from the `value_map` dictionary. This is done using the `sorted` function with a key function `lambda x: value_map[x]` that maps each word to its numerical value for sorting.
5. The sorted list based on numerical values is ['zero', 'four', 'five', 'seven', 'eight', 'nine'].
6. Finally, the sorted list of words is joined back into a single string with spaces separating the words, resulting in 'zero four five seven eight nine'.

<<<Output>>>
zero four five seven eight nine
