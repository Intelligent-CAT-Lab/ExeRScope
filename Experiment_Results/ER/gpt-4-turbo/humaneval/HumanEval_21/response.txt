<<<Analysis>>>
The function `rescale_to_unit` takes a list of floating-point numbers as input. In this case, the input list is `[2.0, 49.9]`.
The function first calculates the minimum and maximum values from the list. For the given list, `min_number` is 2.0 and `max_number` is 49.9.
The function then uses a list comprehension to rescale each number in the list to a unit scale. This is done by subtracting the minimum value from each number and then dividing by the range (max_number - min_number).
For the number 2.0, the calculation is `(2.0 - 2.0) / (49.9 - 2.0) = 0.0 / 47.9 = 0.0`.
For the number 49.9, the calculation is `(49.9 - 2.0) / (49.9 - 2.0) = 47.9 / 47.9 = 1.0`.
Thus, the function returns the list `[0.0, 1.0]`.

<<<Output>>>
[0.0, 1.0]
