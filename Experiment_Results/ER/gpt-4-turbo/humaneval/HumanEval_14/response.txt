<<<Analysis>>>
The function `all_prefixes` is designed to take a string as input and return a list of all prefixes of that string. The input string in this case is 'asdfgh'.
The function initializes an empty list `result` to store the prefixes.
It then enters a loop that iterates over the length of the string, which is 6 in this case (since 'asdfgh' has 6 characters).
In each iteration, the function appends a substring of the input string from the start up to the current index plus one to the `result` list. This is done using slicing `string[:i+1]`.
The iterations work as follows:
- In the first iteration (i=0), the substring 'a' is appended.
- In the second iteration (i=1), the substring 'as' is appended.
- In the third iteration (i=2), the substring 'asd' is appended.
- In the fourth iteration (i=3), the substring 'asdf' is appended.
- In the fifth iteration (i=4), the substring 'asdfg' is appended.
- In the sixth iteration (i=5), the substring 'asdfgh' is appended.
After completing the loop, the function returns the `result` list, which now contains all the prefixes of 'asdfgh'.

<<<Output>>>
['a', 'as', 'asd', 'asdf', 'asdfg', 'asdfgh']
