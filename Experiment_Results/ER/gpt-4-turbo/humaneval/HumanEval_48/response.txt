<<<Analysis>>>
The function `is_palindrome` is designed to check if the given string `text` is a palindrome. A palindrome is a string that reads the same backward as forward.

1. The input string 'xywyx' is passed to the function.
2. The function starts a loop that iterates over the indices of the string. The loop runs from 0 to the length of the string divided by 2 (not inclusive). This is because only half the string needs to be checked against its other half.
3. In each iteration, the function compares the character at the current index `i` with the character at the mirrored index from the end (`len(text) - 1 - i`).
   - For `i = 0`, it compares 'x' (text[0]) with 'x' (text[4]). They are the same.
   - For `i = 1`, it compares 'y' (text[1]) with 'y' (text[3]). They are the same.
   - For `i = 2`, it compares 'w' (text[2]) with 'w' (text[2]). They are the same.
4. Since all corresponding characters match and no mismatches are found, the loop completes without returning `False`.
5. After the loop, the function returns `True`, indicating that 'xywyx' is indeed a palindrome.
