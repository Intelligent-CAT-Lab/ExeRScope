<<<Analysis>>>
The function `add` is designed to sum elements of a list that are at odd indices and are even numbers. The input list provided is `[4, 88]`.
1. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the list `lst`. The range used in the list comprehension starts from index 1, goes up to the length of the list, and increments by 2, meaning it only considers elements at odd indices.
2. In this case, the list has only two elements, so the indices are 0 and 1. The list comprehension will only consider the element at index 1, which is 88.
3. The condition inside the list comprehension checks if the element at the odd index is even. Here, 88 is even.
4. Since 88 meets the condition, it is included in the list that will be summed.
5. The `sum` function then adds up the elements of the resulting list, which contains just one element: 88.
6. The function returns the sum, which is 88.
