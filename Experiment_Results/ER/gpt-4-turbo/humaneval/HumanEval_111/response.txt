<<<Analysis>>>
The function `histogram` takes a single string input and returns a dictionary where the keys are words from the input string and the values are the highest frequency of any word in the string.

1. The input string `'a b b a'` is split into a list `list1` containing the elements ['a', 'b', 'b', 'a'].
2. `dict1` is initialized as an empty dictionary, and `t` is initialized to 0, which will be used to store the maximum frequency of any word.
3. The function then iterates over each word in `list1`. For each word, it checks if the count of that word in `list1` is greater than `t` and if the word is not an empty string. During this iteration:
   - For 'a', the count is 2, which is greater than `t` (0), so `t` is updated to 2.
   - For 'b', the count is also 2, but since `t` is already 2, `t` remains unchanged.
4. After determining the maximum frequency `t` (which is 2), another loop iterates over `list1` again. This time, it checks if the count of each word equals `t` and if so, adds the word to `dict1` with its count as the value.
   - Both 'a' and 'b' have a count of 2, so they are added to `dict1` with the value 2.
5. Since the dictionary insertion checks for existing keys, each word is added only once, resulting in `dict1` containing {'a': 2, 'b': 2}.

The function returns this dictionary, which represents the words with the highest frequency in the input string and their respective counts.

<<<Output>>>
{'a': 2, 'b': 2}
