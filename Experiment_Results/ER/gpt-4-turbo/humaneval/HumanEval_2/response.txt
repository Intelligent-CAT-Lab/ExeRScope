<<<Analysis>>>
The function `truncate_number` takes a float `number` as input. The operation performed inside the function is `number % 1.0`, which calculates the remainder of the division of `number` by 1.0. This effectively extracts the fractional part of the number. For the input 3.5, the integer part is 3 and the fractional part is 0.5. When 3.5 is divided by 1.0, the remainder is 0.5, which is the fractional part of the number.
<<<Output>>>
0.5
