<<<Analysis>>>
The function `total_match` takes two lists of strings, `lst1` and `lst2`, as input. It calculates the total length of all strings in each list and compares these total lengths.

1. `lst1` is `['hi', 'admin']`. The lengths of the strings are 2 and 5, respectively. Thus, `l1` (the total length of strings in `lst1`) is 2 + 5 = 7.
2. `lst2` is `['hi', 'hi']`. The lengths of the strings are both 2. Thus, `l2` (the total length of strings in `lst2`) is 2 + 2 = 4.
3. The function then compares `l1` and `l2`. Since `l1` (7) is greater than `l2` (4), the function will return `lst2` according to the condition `if l1 <= l2`.

<<<Output>>>
['hi', 'hi']
