<<<Analysis>>>
The function `numerical_letter_grade` takes a list of GPA scores and converts each GPA into a corresponding letter grade based on predefined ranges. The input list for this function call is `[4.0, 3, 1.7, 2, 3.5]`.

1. For the first GPA, 4.0, the condition `gpa == 4.0` is true, so "A+" is appended to the `letter_grade` list.
2. For the second GPA, 3, it does not meet any of the conditions for "A+" or "A" grades and falls through the conditions until `gpa > 2.7` (for "B") is also false. It meets the condition `gpa > 2.3` (for "B-"), so "B-" is appended.
3. For the third GPA, 1.7, it meets the condition `gpa > 1.3` (for "C-"), so "C-" is appended.
4. For the fourth GPA, 2, it meets the condition `gpa > 1.7` (for "C"), so "C" is appended.
5. For the fifth GPA, 3.5, it meets the condition `gpa > 3.3` (for "A-"), so "A-" is appended.

The function returns the list of letter grades corresponding to each GPA in the input list.

<<<Output>>>
['A+', 'B-', 'C-', 'C', 'A-']
