<<<Analysis>>>
The function `sort_array` takes a list `arr` as input. The input list provided is `[1,5,2,3,4]`.
The function returns the list sorted in two steps:
1. The list is first sorted numerically, resulting in `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
2. The list is then sorted based on the count of '1's in their binary representation. The lambda function `lambda x: bin(x)[2:].count('1')` is used as the key for sorting:
   - `bin(1)[2:]` is '1', which has 1 '1'.
   - `bin(2)[2:]` is '10', which has 1 '1'.
   - `bin(3)[2:]` is '11', which has 2 '1's.
   - `bin(4)[2:]` is '100', which has 1 '1'.
   - `bin(5)[2:]` is '101', which has 2 '1's.
   Sorting by the count of '1's, the numbers with 1 '1' (1, 2, 4) remain in their original order from the first sort, and numbers with 2 '1's (3, 5) also remain in their original order. Thus, the final sorted list is `[1, 2, 4, 3, 5]`.

[1, 2, 4, 3, 5]
