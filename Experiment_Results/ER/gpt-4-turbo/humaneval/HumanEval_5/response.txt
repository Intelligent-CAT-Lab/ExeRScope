<<<Analysis>>>
The function `intersperse` is designed to take a list of integers `numbers` and an integer `delimeter`, and return a new list where the `delimeter` is inserted between each element of `numbers`.
1. The function first checks if the `numbers` list is empty. If it is, it immediately returns an empty list.
2. In this specific call `intersperse([], 7)`, the input list `numbers` is empty.
3. Since the list is empty, the function hits the condition `if not numbers:` and returns an empty list without proceeding to any further steps.
