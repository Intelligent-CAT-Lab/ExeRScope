<<<Analysis>>>
The function `unique_digits` takes a list of integers `x` as input. It initializes an empty list `odd_digit_elements` to store numbers that consist only of odd digits.
The function iterates over each element `i` in the input list `x`. For each element, it checks if all digits in the number are odd using a generator expression inside the `all` function. This is done by converting each digit `c` to an integer and checking if `int(c) % 2 == 1`.
The numbers from the input list are:
- 15: Both digits 1 and 5 are odd, so it meets the condition.
- 33: Both digits 3 and 3 are odd, so it meets the condition.
- 1422: Contains the digits 1, 4, 2, 2. Since 4 and 2 are even, it does not meet the condition.
- 1: The single digit 1 is odd, so it meets the condition.
The numbers that meet the condition (15, 33, 1) are then added to the `odd_digit_elements` list.
Finally, the function returns the `odd_digit_elements` list sorted in ascending order. The sorted list of numbers with only odd digits is [1, 15, 33].

<<<Output>>>
[1, 15, 33]
