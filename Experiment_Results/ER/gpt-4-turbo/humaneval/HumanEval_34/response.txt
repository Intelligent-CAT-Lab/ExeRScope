<<<Analysis>>>
The function `unique` takes a list `l` as input. The steps executed by the function are as follows:
1. The function converts the list `l` to a set, which automatically removes any duplicate elements because sets do not allow duplicates.
2. The set is then converted back into a list.
3. This list is sorted in ascending order.
4. The sorted list is returned.

For the input `[5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123]`, the steps are:
- Convert to set: `{0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123}`
- Convert set back to list: `[0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123]`
- Sort the list: `[0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123]`
- Return the sorted list.

<<<Output>>>
[0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123]
