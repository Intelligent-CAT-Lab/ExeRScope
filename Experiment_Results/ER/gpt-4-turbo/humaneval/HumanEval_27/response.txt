<<<Analysis>>>
The function `flip_case` takes a single argument, a string, and returns a new string where each uppercase letter in the original string is converted to lowercase, and each lowercase letter is converted to uppercase. This is achieved using the `swapcase()` method of the string class in Python.
For the input 'Hello!', the `swapcase()` method processes each character:
- 'H' (uppercase) becomes 'h' (lowercase)
- 'e' (lowercase) becomes 'E' (uppercase)
- 'l' (lowercase) becomes 'L' (uppercase)
- 'l' (lowercase) becomes 'L' (uppercase)
- 'o' (lowercase) becomes 'O' (uppercase)
- '!' remains '!' since it is not a letter.
Thus, the output string after applying `swapcase()` to 'Hello!' is 'hELLO!'.

<<<Output>>>
hELLO!
