<<<Analysis>>>
The function `reverse_delete` takes two parameters: a string `s` and a string `c`. The function processes the string `s` by removing all characters that are present in the string `c`.
1. The input string `s` is "abcde", and the characters to be removed `c` are "ae".
2. The list comprehension inside the function iterates through each character in "abcde" and includes it in the new string only if it is not in "ae".
3. The characters 'a' and 'e' are removed from "abcde", resulting in the string "bcd".
4. The function then checks if the resulting string "bcd" is a palindrome by comparing it with its reverse "dcb".
5. Since "bcd" is not equal to "dcb", the function returns a tuple containing the string "bcd" and the boolean value `False`.

<<<Output>>>
('bcd', False)
