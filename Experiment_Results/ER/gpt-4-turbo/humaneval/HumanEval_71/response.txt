<<<Analysis>>>
The function `triangle_area` is designed to calculate the area of a triangle given the lengths of its sides a, b, and c. The input values are a=3, b=4, and c=5.
1. The function first checks if the given sides can form a triangle using the triangle inequality theorem. The conditions checked are:
   - a + b <= c
   - a + c <= b
   - b + c <= a
   For the inputs 3, 4, and 5, none of these conditions are true, so the function proceeds to calculate the area.
2. The semi-perimeter `s` of the triangle is calculated as (a + b + c) / 2, which equals (3 + 4 + 5) / 2 = 6.
3. The area of the triangle is then calculated using Heron's formula:
   - area = sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c))
   - Plugging in the values, area = sqrt(6 * (6 - 3) * (6 - 4) * (6 - 5)) = sqrt(6 * 3 * 2 * 1) = sqrt(36) = 6.
4. The area is then rounded to two decimal places, resulting in 6.00.
5. The function returns the calculated area, which is 6.00.

<<<Output>>>
6.00
