<<<Analysis>>>
The function `fibfib` is a modified Fibonacci sequence function that takes an integer `n` as input. The function returns:
- 0 if `n` is 0 or 1.
- 1 if `n` is 2.
- The sum of the previous three terms of the sequence if `n` is greater than 2.

For the input `fibfib(2)`, the function checks:
- If `n` is 0, it returns 0.
- If `n` is 1, it returns 0.
- If `n` is 2, it returns 1.

Since the input is 2, the function directly matches the condition where `n` is 2 and returns 1.
