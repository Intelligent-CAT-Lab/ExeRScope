<<<Analysis>>>
The function `remove_duplicates` is designed to remove all elements from the list that appear more than once. The input list is `[1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 3, 5]`.
1. The function uses the `collections.Counter` to count the occurrences of each element in the list. The resulting counter `c` will be `{1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 2, 4: 1, 5: 1}`.
2. A list comprehension is used to create a new list. It includes only those numbers `n` from the original list `numbers` for which the count `c[n]` is less than or equal to 1.
3. According to the counter `c`, the numbers 1, 4, and 5 appear exactly once in the list. Therefore, these numbers will be included in the new list.
4. The numbers 2 and 3, which appear twice, will not be included in the new list.
5. The final list, after removing duplicates, is `[1, 4, 5]`.

<<<Output>>>
[1, 4, 5]
