<<<Analysis>>>
The function `choose_num` takes two parameters, `x` and `y`, which are initialized to 12 and 15 respectively.
1. The function first checks if `x` is greater than `y`. In this case, since 12 is not greater than 15, it does not return -1 and moves to the next condition.
2. Next, it checks if `y` is even by checking `y % 2 == 0`. Since 15 % 2 equals 1 (15 is odd), it does not return `y` and moves to the next condition.
3. Then, it checks if `x` is equal to `y`. Since 12 is not equal to 15, it does not return -1 and moves to the final return statement.
4. The final return statement is executed, returning `y - 1`, which is 15 - 1 = 14.
