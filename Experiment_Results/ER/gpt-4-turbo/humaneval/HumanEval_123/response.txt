<<<Analysis>>>
The function `get_odd_collatz` is designed to compute the Collatz sequence for a given number `n` and return a sorted list of the odd numbers encountered in the sequence. The input `n` is initialized to 14.

1. Since 14 is even, the list `odd_collatz` is initialized as an empty list.
2. The function enters a while loop that continues until `n` becomes 1.
3. Inside the loop:
   - Since 14 is even, it is halved to 7.
   - 7 is odd, so it is added to the `odd_collatz` list.
   - The next value of `n` is calculated as `7*3 + 1 = 22`.
   - 22 is even, so it is halved to 11.
   - 11 is odd, so it is added to the `odd_collatz` list.
   - The next value of `n` is `11*3 + 1 = 34`.
   - 34 is even, so it is halved to 17.
   - 17 is odd, so it is added to the `odd_collatz` list.
   - The next value of `n` is `17*3 + 1 = 52`.
   - 52 is even, so it is halved to 26.
   - 26 is even, so it is halved to 13.
   - 13 is odd, so it is added to the `odd_collatz` list.
   - The next value of `n` is `13*3 + 1 = 40`.
   - 40 is even, so it is halved to 20.
   - 20 is even, so it is halved to 10.
   - 10 is even, so it is halved to 5.
   - 5 is odd, so it is added to the `odd_collatz` list.
   - The next value of `n` is `5*3 + 1 = 16`.
   - 16 is even, so it is halved to 8.
   - 8 is even, so it is halved to 4.
   - 4 is even, so it is halved to 2.
   - 2 is even, so it is halved to 1, ending the loop.
4. The list `odd_collatz` now contains [7, 11, 17, 13, 5].
5. The list is sorted to [5, 7, 11, 13, 17].

<<<Output>>>
[5, 7, 11, 13, 17]
