<<<Analysis>>>
The function `file_name_check` is designed to validate file names based on specific rules. The input provided is "example.txt".

1. The function starts by defining a list `suf` containing valid file extensions: 'txt', 'exe', 'dll'.
2. The file name "example.txt" is split into a list `lst` using the dot separator, resulting in `lst = ['example', 'txt']`.
3. The function checks if the length of `lst` is exactly 2, which it is in this case.
4. It then checks if the second element of `lst` (the file extension) is in the `suf` list. 'txt' is indeed in the list.
5. Next, it checks if the first element of `lst` (the file name without the extension) is non-empty, which 'example' is.
6. The function checks if the first character of the file name is alphabetic, which is true for 'example'.
7. Finally, it counts the number of digits in the file name. 'example' contains no digits, so the count is 0, which is less than or equal to 3.

Since all conditions are met, the function returns 'Yes'.

<<<Output>>>
Yes
