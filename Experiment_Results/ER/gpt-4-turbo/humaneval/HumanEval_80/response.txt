<<<Analysis>>>
The function `is_happy` takes a string `s` as input. The first condition in the function checks if the length of `s` is less than 3. If it is, the function immediately returns `False`. In this case, the input string "a" has a length of 1, which is indeed less than 3. Therefore, the function does not proceed to the loop and directly returns `False`.

<<<Output>>>
False
