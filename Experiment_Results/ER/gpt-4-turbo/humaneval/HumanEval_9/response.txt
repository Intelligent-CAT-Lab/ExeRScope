<<<Analysis>>>
The function `rolling_max` takes a list of integers as input and returns a list of integers where each element is the maximum value encountered so far in the list.

1. The input list is `[3, 2, 3, 100, 3]`.
2. The variable `running_max` is initialized to `None` and `result` is an empty list.
3. The function iterates over each number in the input list:
   - For the first number `3`, since `running_max` is `None`, `running_max` is set to `3`. The `result` list becomes `[3]`.
   - For the second number `2`, `running_max` remains `3` because `max(3, 2)` is `3`. The `result` list becomes `[3, 3]`.
   - For the third number `3`, `running_max` remains `3` as `max(3, 3)` is `3`. The `result` list becomes `[3, 3, 3]`.
   - For the fourth number `100`, `running_max` updates to `100` because `max(3, 100)` is `100`. The `result` list becomes `[3, 3, 3, 100]`.
   - For the fifth number `3`, `running_max` remains `100` as `max(100, 3)` is `100`. The `result` list becomes `[3, 3, 3, 100, 100]`.
4. The function returns the `result` list.
