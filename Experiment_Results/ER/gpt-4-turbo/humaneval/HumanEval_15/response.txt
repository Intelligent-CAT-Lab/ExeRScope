<<<Analysis>>>
The function `string_sequence` takes an integer `n` as input. The function generates a sequence of integers from 0 to `n` inclusive. This sequence is then converted into a list of strings. Each integer in the range is converted to a string and collected into a list. The list of strings is then joined into a single string with spaces separating the elements. For the input `n = 0`, the range will be from 0 to 0, which includes just the number 0. Therefore, the list of strings will contain only one element, "0". The final output is the string "0" joined by spaces, which remains "0" as there is only one element.
<<<Output>>>
"0"
