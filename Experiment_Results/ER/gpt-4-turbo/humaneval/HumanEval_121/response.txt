<<<Analysis>>>
The function `solution` takes a list `lst` as input. The function returns the sum of elements in the list that are located at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) and are odd numbers.
Here's the breakdown for the input `[5, 8, 7, 1]`:
- The list comprehension iterates over the list with `enumerate` to get both the index and the value.
- It checks two conditions for each element: the index should be even (`idx%2==0`), and the element should be odd (`x%2==1`).
- For the list `[5, 8, 7, 1]`, the elements at even indices are 5 (index 0) and 7 (index 2). Both 5 and 7 are odd.
- The sum of these elements (5 and 7) is calculated, which equals 12.

<<<Output>>>
12
