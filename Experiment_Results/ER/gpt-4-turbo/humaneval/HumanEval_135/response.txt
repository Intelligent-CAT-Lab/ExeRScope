<<<Analysis>>>
The function `can_arrange` takes a list `arr` as input. The variable `ind` is initialized to -1, and `i` is initialized to 1. The function then enters a while loop that iterates as long as `i` is less than the length of the list `arr`.

During each iteration of the loop:
- The function checks if the current element `arr[i]` is less than the previous element `arr[i-1]`.
- If this condition is true, `ind` is updated to the current index `i`.
- The variable `i` is then incremented by 1.

For the input list `[1, 2, 4, 3, 5]`:
- When `i = 1`, `arr[1]` is 2 and `arr[0]` is 1. Since 2 is not less than 1, `ind` remains -1.
- When `i = 2`, `arr[2]` is 4 and `arr[1]` is 2. Since 4 is not less than 2, `ind` remains -1.
- When `i = 3`, `arr[3]` is 3 and `arr[2]` is 4. Since 3 is less than 4, `ind` is updated to 3.
- When `i = 4`, `arr[4]` is 5 and `arr[3]` is 3. Since 5 is not less than 3, `ind` remains 3.

After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `ind`, which is 3, indicating the index where the list first fails to be in ascending order.
