<<<Analysis>>>
The function `hex_key` takes a string `num` as input and initializes a tuple `primes` containing characters that represent prime numbers in hexadecimal ('2', '3', '5', '7', 'B', 'D'). It also initializes a variable `total` to 0, which will be used to count the occurrences of these prime characters in the input string.
The function then iterates over each character in the input string `num`. For each character, it checks if the character is in the `primes` tuple. If it is, it increments the `total` by 1.
In this specific case, the input string is "AB". The function checks each character:
- 'A' is not in `primes`, so `total` remains 0.
- 'B' is in `primes`, so `total` is incremented by 1.
After iterating through all characters, the function returns the value of `total`, which is 1 in this case.
