<<<Analysis>>>
The function `monotonic` is designed to check if a given list `l` is either non-decreasing or non-increasing. The input list provided is `[1, 2, 4, 10]`.
1. The function first checks if the list `l` is equal to the list sorted in non-decreasing order (`sorted(l)`). In this case, `sorted([1, 2, 4, 10])` results in `[1, 2, 4, 10]`, which is indeed equal to the original list.
2. Since the first condition is true, the function does not need to check the second condition (whether the list is equal to the list sorted in non-increasing order).
3. The function returns `True` because the list `[1, 2, 4, 10]` is sorted in non-decreasing order.

<<<Output>>>
