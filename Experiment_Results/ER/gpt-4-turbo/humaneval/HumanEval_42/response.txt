<<<Analysis>>>
The function `incr_list` takes a list `l` as an argument. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each element `e` in the list `l`. For each element `e`, it adds 1 to `e` and the result is collected into a new list. The input list is `[5, 2, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123]`. The function processes each element as follows:
- 5 becomes 6
- 2 becomes 3
- 5 becomes 6
- 2 becomes 3
- 3 becomes 4
- 3 becomes 4
- 9 becomes 10
- 0 becomes 1
- 123 becomes 124
The new list with these updated values is then returned by the function.
<<<Output>>>
[6, 3, 6, 3, 4, 4, 10, 1, 124]
