<<<Analysis>>>
The function `is_prime(n)` is designed to determine whether a given number `n` is a prime number. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

1. The input number `n` is 6.
2. The function first checks if `n` is less than 2. Since 6 is not less than 2, it proceeds to the next step.
3. The function then enters a loop where it checks if `n` is divisible by any number `k` from 2 to `n-1`. In this case, it will check for divisibility from 2 to 5.
4. When `k` is 2, the function checks if `6 % 2 == 0`. Since this condition is true (6 is divisible by 2), the function returns `False`, indicating that 6 is not a prime number.

The function does not need to check divisibility for the rest of the values of `k` because it has already determined that 6 is not a prime number when `k` was 2.
