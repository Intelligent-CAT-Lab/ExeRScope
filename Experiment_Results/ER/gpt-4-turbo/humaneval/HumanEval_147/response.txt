The function `get_max_triples(n)` is designed to find the number of triples `(A[i], A[j], A[k])` such that the sum of these three elements is divisible by 3. The list `A` is generated using the formula `i*i - i + 1` for each `i` from 1 to `n`.

For `n = 5`, the list `A` is computed as follows:
- For `i = 1`: `1*1 - 1 + 1 = 1`
- For `i = 2`: `2*2 - 2 + 1 = 3`
- For `i = 3`: `3*3 - 3 + 1 = 7`
- For `i = 4`: `4*4 - 4 + 1 = 13`
- For `i = 5`: `5*5 - 5 + 1 = 21`
Thus, `A = [1, 3, 7, 13, 21]`.

The function then iterates over all possible triples `(i, j, k)` where `i < j < k` and checks if the sum of the corresponding elements from `A` is divisible by 3:
- For `(i, j, k) = (0, 1, 2)`: `A[0] + A[1] + A[2] = 1 + 3 + 7 = 11` (not divisible by 3)
- For `(i, j, k) = (0, 1, 3)`: `A[0] + A[1] + A[3] = 1 + 3 + 13 = 17` (not divisible by 3)
- For `(i, j, k) = (0, 1, 4)`: `A[0] + A[1] + A[4] = 1 + 3 + 21 = 25` (not divisible by 3)
- For `(i, j, k) = (0, 2, 3)`: `A[0] + A[2] + A[3] = 1 + 7 + 13 = 21` (divisible by 3)
- For `(i, j, k) = (0, 2, 4)`: `A[0] + A[2] + A[4] = 1 + 7 + 21 = 29` (not divisible by 3)
- For `(i, j, k) = (0, 3, 4)`: `A[0] + A[3] + A[4] = 1 + 13 + 21 = 35` (not divisible by 3)
- For `(i, j, k) = (1, 2, 3)`: `A[1] + A[2] + A[3] = 3 + 7 + 13 = 23` (not divisible by 3)
- For `(i, j, k) = (1, 2, 4)`: `A[1] + A[2] + A[4] = 3 + 7 + 21 = 31` (not divisible by 3)
- For `(i, j, k) = (1, 3, 4)`: `A[1] + A[3] + A[4] = 3 + 13 + 21 = 37` (not divisible by 3)
- For `(i, j, k) = (2, 3, 4)`: `A[2] + A[3] + A[4] = 7 + 13 + 21 = 41` (not divisible by 3)

Only one triple `(0, 2, 3)` results in a sum that is divisible by 3. Therefore, the function returns the count of such triples, which is 1.
