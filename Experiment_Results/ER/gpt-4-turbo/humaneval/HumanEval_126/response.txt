<<<Analysis>>>
The function `is_sorted` takes a list `lst` as input. In this case, the input list is `[5]`.
1. A dictionary `count_digit` is created using a list comprehension and dictionary constructor. This dictionary counts occurrences of each element in the list. For the list `[5]`, the dictionary will be `{5: 0}` initially.
2. The dictionary is then updated in a loop to count the occurrences of each element. After processing the list `[5]`, the dictionary becomes `{5: 1}`.
3. The function then checks if any element in the list appears more than twice using the condition `any(count_digit[i] > 2 for i in lst)`. Since the maximum count is 1 (for element 5), this condition is False.
4. The function proceeds to check if the list is sorted in non-decreasing order. This is done using the condition `all(lst[i-1] <= lst[i] for i in range(1, len(lst)))`. Since the list has only one element, the range for the loop is empty, and the `all` function returns True on an empty input.
5. As the list passes both checks (no element appears more than twice and the list is sorted), the function returns `True`.
