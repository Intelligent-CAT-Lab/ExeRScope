<<<Analysis>>>
The function `special_factorial` is designed to compute a special factorial of a given number `n`. Here's how it works:
1. Two variables `fact_i` and `special_fact` are initialized to 1.
2. The function enters a loop that iterates from 1 to `n` (inclusive). For `n=4`, the loop will iterate through 1, 2, 3, and 4.
3. In each iteration:
   - `fact_i` is updated to be the factorial of the current loop index `i`. This is done by multiplying `fact_i` by `i`.
   - `special_fact` is then updated by multiplying it by the current value of `fact_i`.
4. The specific calculations for each iteration are:
   - When `i=1`: `fact_i` becomes `1*1 = 1`, and `special_fact` becomes `1*1 = 1`.
   - When `i=2`: `fact_i` becomes `1*2 = 2`, and `special_fact` becomes `1*2 = 2`.
   - When `i=3`: `fact_i` becomes `2*3 = 6`, and `special_fact` becomes `2*6 = 12`.
   - When `i=4`: `fact_i` becomes `6*4 = 24`, and `special_fact` becomes `12*24 = 288`.
5. After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `special_fact`, which is 288 for `n=4`.
