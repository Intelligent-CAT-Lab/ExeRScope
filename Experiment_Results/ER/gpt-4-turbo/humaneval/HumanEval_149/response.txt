<<<Analysis>>>
The function `sorted_list_sum` takes a list of strings as input. The input list is `["aa", "a", "aaa"]`.
1. The list is first sorted alphabetically, resulting in `["a", "aa", "aaa"]`.
2. A new list `new_lst` is initialized as an empty list.
3. The function then iterates over the sorted list. For each string in the list, it checks if the length of the string is even.
   - "a" has a length of 1, which is odd, so it is not added to `new_lst`.
   - "aa" has a length of 2, which is even, so it is added to `new_lst`.
   - "aaa" has a length of 3, which is odd, so it is not added to `new_lst`.
4. After the loop, `new_lst` contains ["aa"].
5. The function returns `new_lst` sorted by the length of the strings. Since `new_lst` contains only one string, it remains ["aa"] when sorted by length.

<<<Output>>>
["aa"]
