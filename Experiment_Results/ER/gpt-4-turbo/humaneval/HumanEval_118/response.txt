<<<Analysis>>>
The function `get_closest_vowel` is designed to find the closest vowel in a given word that is surrounded by non-vowel characters, starting the search from the third last character towards the beginning of the word. The input word is "yogurt".

1. The function first checks if the length of the word is less than 3. If it is, it returns an empty string. In this case, "yogurt" has 6 characters, so the function proceeds.
2. A set of vowels (both lowercase and uppercase) is defined.
3. The function then iterates over the word starting from the third last character (index 3 in "yogurt", which is 'u') and moves backwards towards the start of the word.
4. The loop checks each character to see if it is a vowel and if both the preceding and following characters are not vowels:
   - At index 3: 'u' is a vowel, 'r' (index 4) is not a vowel, and 'g' (index 2) is not a vowel. This satisfies the condition.
5. Since the condition is met at index 3, the function returns 'u'.

Thus, the closest vowel in "yogurt" that is surrounded by non-vowels, starting from the third last character, is 'u'.

<<<Output>>>
u
