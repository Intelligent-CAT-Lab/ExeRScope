The function `pairs_sum_to_zero` takes a list `l` as input and checks if there are any two distinct elements in the list that sum to zero. The input list provided is `[1, 3, 5, 0]`.

1. The function starts by iterating over each element `l1` of the list `l` using its index `i`.
2. For each element `l1`, it then iterates over the subsequent elements of the list starting from index `i + 1` to the end of the list.
3. For each pair `(l1, l[j])`, it checks if their sum equals zero.
4. The iterations proceed as follows:
   - For `i = 0` (l1 = 1), it checks:
     - `1 + 3` (j = 1)
     - `1 + 5` (j = 2)
     - `1 + 0` (j = 3)
   - For `i = 1` (l1 = 3), it checks:
     - `3 + 5` (j = 2)
     - `3 + 0` (j = 3)
   - For `i = 2` (l1 = 5), it checks:
     - `5 + 0` (j = 3)
   - For `i = 3` (l1 = 0), there are no more elements to check.
5. None of these sums equal zero.

Since no pair sums to zero, the function will return `False`.
