<<<Analysis>>>
The function `separate_paren_groups` is designed to separate groups of well-formed parentheses from a given string and return them as a list of strings. The input string is `'(()()) ((())) () ((())()())'`.

1. The function initializes an empty list `result` to store the final groups of parentheses, an empty list `current_string` to build the current group, and an integer `current_depth` to track the depth of nested parentheses.

2. The function iterates over each character `c` in the input string:
   - For `c == '('`: It increments `current_depth` by 1 and appends `c` to `current_string`.
   - For `c == ')'`: It decrements `current_depth` by 1 and appends `c` to `current_string`.
   - If after processing a `')'` the `current_depth` becomes 0, it means a complete group of parentheses has been formed. This group is joined into a string and added to `result`, and `current_string` is cleared for the next group.

3. The input string is processed as follows:
   - '(()())' forms a complete group when the depth returns to 0 after the last ')'.
   - ' ((()))' forms another group.
   - ' ()' forms a simple group.
   - ' ((())()())' forms the last group.

4. Each group is added to the `result` list as it is completed.

5. The function returns the list `result` containing all the separated groups of parentheses.

['(()())', '((()))', '()', '((())()())']
