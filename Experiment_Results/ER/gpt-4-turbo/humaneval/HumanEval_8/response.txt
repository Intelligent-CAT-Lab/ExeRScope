<<<Analysis>>>
The function `sum_product` is designed to take a list of integers as input and return a tuple containing the sum and the product of all the integers in the list.
The input list provided is `[1, 1, 1]`.
The function initializes `sum_value` to 0 and `prod_value` to 1.
It then iterates over each number in the list:
1. For the first number (1), it adds 1 to `sum_value` (making it 1) and multiplies 1 with `prod_value` (keeping it 1).
2. For the second number (1), it adds 1 to `sum_value` (making it 2) and multiplies 1 with `prod_value` (keeping it 2).
3. For the third number (1), it adds 1 to `sum_value` (making it 3) and multiplies 1 with `prod_value` (keeping it 3).
After processing all numbers, the function returns a tuple `(3, 1)`, where 3 is the sum of the numbers and 1 is their product.
<<<Output>>>
(3, 1)
