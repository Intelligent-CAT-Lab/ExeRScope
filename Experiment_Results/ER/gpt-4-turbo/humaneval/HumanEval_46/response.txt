<<<Analysis>>>
The function `fib4` is designed to compute a sequence where each term is the sum of the previous four terms, starting with the initial list [0, 0, 2, 0]. The function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the nth value of this sequence.

1. The initial list `results` is set to [0, 0, 2, 0].
2. If `n` is less than 4, the function directly returns `results[n]`. For `n = 5`, this condition is not met, so the function proceeds to the loop.
3. The loop starts from 4 and goes up to `n` (inclusive). In each iteration, a new element is appended to `results`. This new element is the sum of the last four elements of `results`.
4. After appending the new element, the first element of `results` is removed to maintain the length of the list at 4.
5. For `n = 5`, the loop runs only once:
   - The new element added is `results[-1] + results[-2] + results[-3] + results[-4]` = 0 + 2 + 0 + 0 = 2.
   - The list `results` becomes [0, 2, 0, 2] after appending 2 and removing the first 0.
6. The function returns the last element of `results`, which is 2.
