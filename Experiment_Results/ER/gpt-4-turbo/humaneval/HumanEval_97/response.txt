<<<Analysis>>>
The function `multiply` takes two parameters, `a` and `b`. It calculates the product of the last digits of both numbers. 
1. The last digit of `a` (148) is obtained using `148 % 10`, which results in 8.
2. The last digit of `b` (412) is obtained using `412 % 10`, which results in 2.
3. These last digits (8 and 2) are then multiplied together, resulting in `8 * 2 = 16`.
4. The function returns the product, which is 16.

<<<Output>>>
16
