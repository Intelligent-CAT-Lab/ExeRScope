The function `greatest_common_divisor` takes two integers, `a` and `b`, as input. Here, `a` is initialized to 3 and `b` to 7.
The function uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two numbers. The algorithm works by repeatedly replacing the larger number by the remainder when the larger number is divided by the smaller number, until the remainder is zero.
The steps are as follows:
1. Initially, `a = 3` and `b = 7`.
2. In the first iteration of the while loop, since `b` is not zero, we calculate `a % b` which is `3 % 7 = 3`. Then, we swap `a` and `b`, so now `a = 7` and `b = 3`.
3. In the second iteration, `a % b` is `7 % 3 = 1`. We swap again, so `a = 3` and `b = 1`.
4. In the third iteration, `a % b` is `3 % 1 = 0`. We swap one last time, so `a = 1` and `b = 0`.
5. Now `b` is zero, so the loop exits, and the function returns `a`, which is now 1.

Thus, the greatest common divisor of 3 and 7 is 1.
