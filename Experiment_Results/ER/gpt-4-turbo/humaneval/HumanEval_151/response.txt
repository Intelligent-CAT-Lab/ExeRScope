<<<Analysis>>>
The function `double_the_difference` takes a list `lst` as input. It returns the sum of the squares of elements in the list that are positive, odd integers. The list comprehension inside the function filters elements based on three conditions: the element should be greater than 0, it should be odd (i.e., `i % 2 != 0`), and it should not contain a decimal point (checked by ensuring that "." is not in the string representation of the element).

For the input `[0.2, 3, 5]`:
- `0.2` is not considered because it is not an integer (it contains a decimal point).
- `3` is considered because it is a positive odd integer.
- `5` is also considered because it is a positive odd integer.

The squares of the numbers that meet the conditions are:
- `3**2 = 9`
- `5**2 = 25`

The sum of these squares is `9 + 25 = 34`.
