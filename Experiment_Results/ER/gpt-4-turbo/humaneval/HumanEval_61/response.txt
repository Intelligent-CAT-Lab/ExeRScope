<<<Analysis>>>
The function `correct_bracketing` is designed to check if the given string of brackets is correctly bracketed. The input string is "(()())".
1. The function initializes a variable `depth` to 0, which will track the nesting level of the brackets.
2. The function iterates over each character in the string:
   - For the first character '(', `depth` is incremented to 1.
   - For the second character '(', `depth` is incremented to 2.
   - For the third character ')', `depth` is decremented to 1.
   - For the fourth character '(', `depth` is incremented back to 2.
   - For the fifth character ')', `depth` is decremented to 1.
   - For the sixth character ')', `depth` is decremented to 0.
3. After the loop, the function checks if `depth` is 0, which it is, indicating that all opened brackets have been closed correctly.
4. The function returns `True` because the string "(()())" is correctly bracketed with no unmatched opening or closing brackets and no negative depth at any point.
