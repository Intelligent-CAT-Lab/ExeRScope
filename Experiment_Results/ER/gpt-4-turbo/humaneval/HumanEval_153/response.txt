<<<Analysis>>>
The function `Strongest_Extension` takes two parameters: `class_name` and `extensions`. The `class_name` is 'Watashi', and `extensions` is a list containing the strings ['tEN', 'niNE', 'eIGHt8OKe'].

1. The function initializes `strong` to the first element of `extensions`, which is 'tEN'.
2. It calculates `my_val` for 'tEN' by finding the difference between the count of uppercase alphabetic characters and the count of lowercase alphabetic characters in 'tEN'. 
   - 'tEN' has 2 uppercase letters ('E', 'N') and 1 lowercase letter ('t'), so `my_val` is 2 - 1 = 1.
3. The function then iterates over each string in `extensions` to compare their respective values calculated similarly to `my_val`.
   - For 'niNE':
     - 2 uppercase ('N', 'E') and 2 lowercase ('n', 'i'), so the value is 2 - 2 = 0.
   - For 'eIGHt8OKe':
     - 5 uppercase ('I', 'G', 'H', 'O', 'K') and 2 lowercase ('e', 't'), so the value is 5 - 2 = 3.
4. During the iteration, when the function processes 'eIGHt8OKe', it finds that its value (3) is greater than the current `my_val` (1). Therefore, `strong` is updated to 'eIGHt8OKe' and `my_val` is updated to 3.
5. After completing the iteration, the function constructs the final answer by concatenating `class_name` with the strongest extension found, separated by a dot. Thus, the result is 'Watashi.eIGHt8OKe'.
