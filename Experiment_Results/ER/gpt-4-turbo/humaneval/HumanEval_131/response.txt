<<<Analysis>>>
The function `digits` is designed to calculate the product of the odd digits of a given number `n`. If there are no odd digits, it returns 0.

1. The input number `n` is 5.
2. The function initializes `product` to 1 and `odd_count` to 0.
3. The function converts the number `n` to a string and iterates over each character (digit) in the string.
4. For each digit, it checks if the digit is odd (i.e., `int_digit % 2 == 1`).
5. Since 5 is odd, the function multiplies `product` by 5 (product = 1 * 5 = 5) and increments `odd_count` by 1 (odd_count = 0 + 1 = 1).
6. After processing all digits, the function checks if `odd_count` is 0. In this case, `odd_count` is 1, so it returns the `product`, which is 5.

<<<Output>>>
5
