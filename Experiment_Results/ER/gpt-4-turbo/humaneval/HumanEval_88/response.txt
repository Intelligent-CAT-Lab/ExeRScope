<<<Analysis>>>
The function `sort_array` takes a list `array` as input. The function first checks if the list is empty. If it is, it returns an empty list. If not, it sorts the list. The direction of the sorting (ascending or descending) is determined by the sum of the first and last elements of the list. If this sum is even, the list is sorted in descending order; if odd, in ascending order.

For the input `[15, 42, 87, 32, 11, 0]`, the first element is 15 and the last element is 0. Their sum is 15 + 0 = 15, which is odd. Therefore, the list will be sorted in ascending order.

The sorted list in ascending order is `[0, 11, 15, 32, 42, 87]`.

<<<Output>>>
[0, 11, 15, 32, 42, 87]
