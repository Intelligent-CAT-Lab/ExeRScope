<<<Analysis>>>
The function `parse_music` takes a single string argument `music_string`. The function defines a dictionary `note_map` that maps musical notation strings to integer values. The function then splits the input string `music_string` by spaces and uses a list comprehension to convert each notation into its corresponding integer value based on the `note_map`. The list comprehension filters out any empty strings resulting from the split operation.

In this specific case, the input to the function is an empty string `''`. When the empty string is split by spaces, the result is a list containing one empty string `['']`. The list comprehension checks each element of the split result; since the element is an empty string and does not match any key in `note_map`, it is ignored (the `if x` condition in the list comprehension filters it out). Therefore, no elements are processed, and the list comprehension returns an empty list.
