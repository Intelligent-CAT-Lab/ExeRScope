<<<Analysis>>>
The function `tri(n)` is designed to generate a list of numbers based on a specific pattern. The input `n` determines the length of the list minus one (since indexing starts at 0).

1. If `n` is 0, the function immediately returns `[1]`.
2. For other values of `n`, the function initializes a list `my_tri` with the first two elements `[1, 3]`.
3. The function then enters a loop starting from `i = 2` to `i = n + 1` (inclusive). The loop uses the value of `i` to determine the next element to append to `my_tri`:
   - If `i` is even, it appends `i / 2 + 1` to `my_tri`.
   - If `i` is odd, it appends the sum of the last two elements of `my_tri` plus `(i + 3) / 2`.
4. For `n = 3`, the loop will run from `i = 2` to `i = 3`:
   - At `i = 2` (even), it appends `2 / 2 + 1 = 2.0` to `my_tri`, resulting in `[1, 3, 2.0]`.
   - At `i = 3` (odd), it appends `3 + 2.0 + (3 + 3) / 2 = 5.0 + 3.0 = 8.0` to `my_tri`, resulting in `[1, 3, 2.0, 8.0]`.
5. The function returns the list `[1, 3, 2.0, 8.0]`.

[1, 3, 2.0, 8.0]
