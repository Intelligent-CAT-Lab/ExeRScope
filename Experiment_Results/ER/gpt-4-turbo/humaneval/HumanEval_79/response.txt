<<<Analysis>>>
The function `decimal_to_binary` takes an integer input named `decimal`. The function converts this integer to its binary representation using Python's built-in `bin()` function. The `bin()` function returns a string that starts with '0b', which represents that the number is in binary format. The function then slices this string from the third character to remove the '0b' prefix. After slicing, it concatenates "db" at the beginning and the end of the binary string. For the input 0, `bin(0)` returns '0b0'. Slicing off the '0b' results in '0', and after adding 'db' at both ends, the final result is 'db0db'.
