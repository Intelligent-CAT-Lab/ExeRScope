<<<Analysis>>>
The function `words_in_sentence` takes a single string input `sentence` and processes it to filter out certain words based on specific conditions. The input sentence is "This is a test".

1. The function initializes an empty list `new_lst` to store words that meet the criteria.
2. The sentence is split into words: ["This", "is", "a", "test"].
3. The function iterates over each word in the list:
   - For "This":
     - The length of "This" is 4. It checks if 4 is divisible by any number from 2 to 3 (since 4-1=3). 4 is divisible by 2, so `flg` is set to 1. "This" is not added to `new_lst`.
   - For "is":
     - The length of "is" is 2. The condition `len(word) == 2` is true, so "is" is added to `new_lst` regardless of the value of `flg`.
   - For "a":
     - The length of "a" is 1. The condition `len(word) == 1` sets `flg` to 1. "a" is not added to `new_lst`.
   - For "test":
     - The length of "test" is 4. It checks if 4 is divisible by any number from 2 to 3. 4 is divisible by 2, so `flg` is set to 1. "test" is not added to `new_lst`.
4. The function returns the words in `new_lst` joined by spaces. The only word in `new_lst` is "is".

<<<Output>>>
is
