<<<Analysis>>>
The function `find_closest_elements` is designed to find the pair of elements in the list `numbers` that have the smallest absolute difference between them. The input list is `[1.0, 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2]`.

1. The function initializes `closest_pair` to `None` and `distance` to `None`.
2. It uses two nested loops to compare each element with every other element in the list. The outer loop iterates through each element `elem` with its index `idx`, and the inner loop does the same with `elem2` and `idx2`.
3. The condition `if idx != idx2` ensures that an element is not compared with itself.
4. For each pair of elements, it calculates the absolute difference `new_distance` between them.
5. If `distance` is `None` (which is true for the first comparison), or if `new_distance` is less than the current `distance`, it updates `distance` to `new_distance` and `closest_pair` to the sorted tuple of the two elements.
6. The smallest difference found through all comparisons determines the closest pair.

For the given list, the closest pair based on the smallest difference is between `3.9` and `4.0`, with a difference of `0.1`.

<<<Output>>>
(3.9, 4.0)
