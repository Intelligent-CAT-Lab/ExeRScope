The function `change_base` is designed to convert a number `x` from base 10 to a specified `base`. The input values are `x = 8` and `base = 3`.
1. The function initializes an empty string `ret` to build the result.
2. It enters a while loop that continues as long as `x` is greater than 0.
3. Inside the loop:
   - The remainder of `x` divided by `base` (3) is calculated. For the first iteration, `8 % 3` equals 2. This remainder is converted to a string and prepended to `ret`, making `ret = "2"`.
   - `x` is then integer divided by `base`. So, `8 // 3` equals 2, updating `x` to 2.
4. The loop runs again since `x` is still greater than 0:
   - Now, `2 % 3` equals 2. This is prepended to `ret`, updating `ret` to "22".
   - `x` is updated to `2 // 3`, which equals 0.
5. The loop exits because `x` is now 0.
6. The function returns `ret`, which is "22".

The result "22" represents the number 8 in base 3, where the digits from right to left represent increasing powers of 3 (i.e., \(2 \times 3^0 + 2 \times 3^1 = 2 + 6 = 8\)).
