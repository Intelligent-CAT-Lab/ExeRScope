<<<Analysis>>>
The function `remove_vowels` is designed to take a string `text` as input and return a new string with all vowels removed. The vowels considered are "a", "e", "i", "o", "u" in both uppercase and lowercase.
1. The input string 'fedcba' is passed to the function.
2. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each character `s` in the string.
3. For each character, it checks if `s.lower()` is not in the list of vowels ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"]. This ensures that both uppercase and lowercase vowels are removed.
4. The characters that are not vowels are 'f', 'd', 'c', 'b'.
5. These characters are joined together to form the resultant string "fdcb".
6. The function returns this new string "fdcb".

<<<Output>>>
fdcb
