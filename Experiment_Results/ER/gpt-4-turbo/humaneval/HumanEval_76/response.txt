<<<Analysis>>>
The function `is_simple_power` takes two arguments, `x` and `n`. The purpose of this function is to determine if `x` can be expressed as `n` raised to some integer power.

1. The function first checks if `n` is 1. If `n` is 1, it returns `True` if `x` is also 1, otherwise `False`. In this case, since `n` is 2, the function does not return at this point.
2. A variable `power` is initialized to 1. This variable will be used to store successive powers of `n`.
3. A while loop runs as long as `power` is less than `x`. In each iteration, `power` is multiplied by `n`.
   - First iteration: `power` = 1 * 2 = 2
   - Second iteration: `power` = 2 * 2 = 4
   - Third iteration: `power` = 4 * 2 = 8
   - Fourth iteration: `power` = 8 * 2 = 16
4. Once `power` equals `x` (16 in this case), the loop exits, and the function returns `True` because `power` (16) is equal to `x` (16).

Thus, the function checks if 16 can be expressed as a power of 2, which it can be as \(2^4\).
