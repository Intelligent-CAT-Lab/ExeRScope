<<<Analysis>>>
The function `get_positive` is designed to filter out and return only the positive elements from a given list. The input list provided is `[-1, -2, 4, 5, 6]`.
The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each element `e` in the list `l`. For each element, it checks if `e > 0`. If the condition is true, the element is included in the resulting list.
In the given list, the elements 4, 5, and 6 are positive (greater than 0), so they meet the condition `e > 0`.
The list comprehension collects these positive numbers and returns them as a new list.
<<<Output>>>
[4, 5, 6]
