<<<Analysis>>>
The function `prime_fib(n: int)` is designed to find the nth prime number in the Fibonacci sequence. The function starts by importing the `math` module and defining a helper function `is_prime(p)` to check if a number `p` is prime.

1. The Fibonacci sequence is initialized with `f = [0, 1]`.
2. The function enters a loop that continues indefinitely until `n` prime Fibonacci numbers have been found.
3. In each iteration, the next Fibonacci number is calculated by summing the last two numbers in the list `f` and appending the result to `f`.
4. The function then checks if the newly appended Fibonacci number is prime using the `is_prime` function.
5. If the number is prime, `n` is decremented by 1.
6. The loop exits when `n` becomes 0, i.e., when the nth prime Fibonacci number has been found.
7. The function returns the last number in the Fibonacci list `f`, which is the nth prime Fibonacci number.

For the input `prime_fib(1)`, the function will find the first prime number in the Fibonacci sequence:
- The Fibonacci sequence starts as [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ...]
- The first prime number in this sequence is 2.
