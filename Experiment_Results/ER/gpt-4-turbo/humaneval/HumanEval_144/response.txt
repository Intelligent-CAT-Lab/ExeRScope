<<<Analysis>>>
The function `simplify` takes two string inputs, `x` and `n`, representing fractions. In this case, `x` is "1/5" and `n` is "5/1".
The function splits these strings by the "/" character to separate the numerators and denominators:
- For `x`, `a` becomes '1' and `b` becomes '5'.
- For `n`, `c` becomes '5' and `d` becomes '1'.

The function then converts these string values to integers and calculates the product of the numerators and the product of the denominators:
- `numerator` is calculated as `1 * 5 = 5`.
- `denom` is calculated as `5 * 1 = 5`.

Next, the function checks if the division of `numerator` by `denom` results in an integer. In this case, `5 / 5` equals `1.0`, which is an integer.

Since the division result is an integer, the function returns `True`.
