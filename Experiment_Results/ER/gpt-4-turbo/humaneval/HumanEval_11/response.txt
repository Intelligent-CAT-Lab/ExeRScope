<<<Analysis>>>
The function `string_xor` takes two binary strings `a` and `b` as input. It defines a nested function `xor` that compares two characters: if they are the same, it returns '0'; otherwise, it returns '1'.
The main function uses a generator expression inside `join`. It iterates over pairs of characters from the two strings `a` and `b` using `zip`, which pairs elements from the two strings together. For each pair `(x, y)`, it calls the `xor` function.
For the input strings '111000' and '101010':
- Pair '1' and '1' results in '0' (same characters).
- Pair '1' and '0' results in '1' (different characters).
- Pair '1' and '1' results in '0' (same characters).
- Pair '0' and '0' results in '0' (same characters).
- Pair '0' and '1' results in '1' (different characters).
- Pair '0' and '0' results in '0' (same characters).
The resulting string from joining all these results is '010010'.
