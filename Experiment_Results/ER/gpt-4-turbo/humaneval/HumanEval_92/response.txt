<<<Analysis>>>
The function `any_int` takes three parameters: x, y, and z. It first checks if all three parameters are integers using `isinstance`. In this case, x=2, y=3, and z=1 are all integers, so the function proceeds to the next condition.
The function then checks if the sum of any two parameters equals the third. Specifically, it checks the following conditions:
1. x + y == z (2 + 3 == 1) which is False.
2. x + z == y (2 + 1 == 3) which is True.
3. y + z == x (3 + 1 == 2) which is False.
Since the second condition (x + z == y) is True, the function returns True.
