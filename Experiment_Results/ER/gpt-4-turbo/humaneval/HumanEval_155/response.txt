<<<Analysis>>>
The function `even_odd_count` is designed to count the number of even and odd digits in the absolute value of the given integer `num`.
1. The input number `num` is 7.
2. The function converts the absolute value of `num` to a string to iterate over each digit.
3. It initializes `even_count` and `odd_count` to 0.
4. The function then iterates over the string representation of `num`. In this case, it iterates over '7'.
5. For each digit, it checks if the digit is even or odd by taking the integer value of the digit and checking the remainder when divided by 2.
6. The digit '7' is odd (7 % 2 equals 1), so `odd_count` is incremented by 1.
7. Since there is only one digit and it is odd, `even_count` remains 0.
8. The function returns a tuple `(even_count, odd_count)`, which in this case is `(0, 1)`.

(0, 1)
