<<<Analysis>>>
The function `modp` takes two parameters, `n` and `p`, which are set to 3 and 5 respectively in this case. The function initializes a variable `ret` to 1. It then enters a loop that iterates `n` times (3 times in this case).

In each iteration of the loop:
1. First iteration (`i=0`): `ret` is updated to `(2 * 1) % 5`, which equals 2.
2. Second iteration (`i=1`): `ret` is updated to `(2 * 2) % 5`, which equals 4.
3. Third iteration (`i=2`): `ret` is updated to `(2 * 4) % 5`, which equals 3.

After completing the loop, the function returns the final value of `ret`, which is 3.
