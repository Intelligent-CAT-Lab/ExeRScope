<<<Analysis>>>
The function `largest_divisor` is designed to find the largest divisor of a given integer `n` that is less than `n` itself. The input provided is `n = 3`.

1. The function starts by iterating over a reversed range from `n` down to 1 (exclusive of `n` itself). This means it starts checking from `n-1`.
2. The range for `n = 3` will be from 2 down to 1.
3. The loop first checks if `3 % 2 == 0`. This condition is false because 3 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1.
4. The loop then checks the next value, which is 1. It checks if `3 % 1 == 0`. This condition is true because 3 divided by 1 has no remainder.
5. Since the condition is met, the function returns 1, which is the largest divisor of 3 that is less than 3 itself.
