<<<Analysis>>>
The function `strlen` is defined to take a single parameter, `string`, which is expected to be of type `str`. The function simply returns the length of the input string using Python's built-in `len()` function.
In this case, the input to the function is the string 'asdasnakj'. The length of this string is calculated by counting the number of characters in it. The string 'asdasnakj' consists of 9 characters.
<<<Output>>>
9
