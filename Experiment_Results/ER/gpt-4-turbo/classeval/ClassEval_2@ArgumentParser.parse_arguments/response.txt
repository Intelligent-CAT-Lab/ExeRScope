<<<Analysis>>>
The `Test.test()` method initializes an instance of `ArgumentParser`. It then defines a command string "script --name=John" and adds two arguments to the parser: "name" and "age". The "age" argument is optional and expects an integer type, while "name" is required by default and expects a string.

The `parse_arguments` method is called with the command string. It processes the command string by splitting it and iterating over the parts:
1. It skips "script".
2. It processes "--name=John", splitting it into key "name" and value "John". Since "name" is expected to be a string (default type), it converts "John" to a string and stores it in the `arguments` dictionary.

The method then checks for missing required arguments. Since "name" was provided and "age" is not required, there are no missing required arguments.

Finally, the method returns `(True, None)` indicating that parsing was successful and there are no missing required arguments.

<<<Output>>>
(True, None)
