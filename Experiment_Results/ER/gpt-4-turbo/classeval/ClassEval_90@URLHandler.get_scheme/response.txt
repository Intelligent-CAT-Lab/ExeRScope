<<<Analysis>>>
The `Test.test()` method creates an instance of the `URLHandler` class with a URL string as its argument. The URL provided is "https://www.bing.com/search?pglt=41&q=humaneval&cvid=4dc2da2bb4bc429eb498c85245ae5253&aqs=edge.0.0l7j69i61j69i60.10008j0j1&FORM=ANNTA1&PC=U531&mkt=zh-CN".

The `get_scheme()` method of the `URLHandler` class is then called on this instance. This method is designed to extract the scheme part of the URL. It does this by finding the position of "://" in the URL string. If found, it returns the substring from the beginning of the URL up to (but not including) the position of "://".

In the provided URL, "://" is found after "https". Therefore, the method will return the substring from the start of the URL up to the position just before "://", which is "https".

https
