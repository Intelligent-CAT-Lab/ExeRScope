<<<Analysis>>>
The `Test.test()` method in the provided code performs the following steps:
1. An instance of `JSONProcessor` is created.
2. A dictionary `test_data` is defined but not used in the test method.
3. A file path `test.json` is specified.
4. The file `test.json` is opened in write mode and the string "Invalid JSON" is written to it. This string is not a valid JSON format.
5. The `read_json` method of `JSONProcessor` is then called with `self.file_path` as the argument.
6. Inside `read_json`, it first checks if the file exists using `os.path.exists(file_path)`. Since the file was just created, it exists.
7. The method then attempts to open and read the JSON data from the file using `json.load(file)`.
8. Because the content of the file ("Invalid JSON") is not valid JSON, the `json.load(file)` will raise a `JSONDecodeError`.
9. The `except` block in `read_json` catches this exception and returns `-1` as the result.
10. Finally, `Test.test()` returns this result, which is `-1`.
