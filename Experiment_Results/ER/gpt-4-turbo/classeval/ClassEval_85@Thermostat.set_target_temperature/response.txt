<<<Analysis>>>
In the test() method, an instance of the Thermostat class is created with initial parameters: current_temperature = 25, target_temperature = 25, and mode = 'cool'.
The method set_target_temperature(10) is then called on this instance, which sets the target_temperature of the thermostat to 10.
Afterwards, the method get_target_temperature() is called, which simply returns the current value of target_temperature.
Since the target_temperature was set to 10 in the previous step, the get_target_temperature() method will return 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
