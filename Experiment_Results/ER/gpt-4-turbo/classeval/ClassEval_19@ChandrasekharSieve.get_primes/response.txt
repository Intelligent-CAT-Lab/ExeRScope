<<<Analysis>>>
The `Test.test()` method initializes an instance of `ChandrasekharSieve` with `n=15`. The constructor (`__init__`) calls the `generate_primes()` method to compute prime numbers up to 15.

In `generate_primes()`:
1. A sieve list of boolean values is initialized to `True` for all indices from 0 to 15, except for indices 0 and 1 which are set to `False` (indicating that 0 and 1 are not prime).
2. The sieve algorithm starts with the smallest prime number, 2. It marks all multiples of 2 (from 4 to 15) as `False`.
3. The next prime, 3, is found and all its multiples from 9 to 15 are marked as `False`.
4. The algorithm continues with the next potential prime, 4, but since it's already marked as `False`, it moves to 5. Multiples of 5 from 25 onwards would be marked, but since 25 is outside the range, no action is taken for 5.
5. The process continues similarly for 6, 7, and 11. For 7, multiples from 49 onwards are outside the range. For 11, multiples from 121 are outside the range.
6. The loop stops when `p * p` exceeds `n` (i.e., when `p` is 5 because 5*5=25 > 15).
7. A list of primes is then constructed by collecting indices that remain `True` in the sieve.

The primes up to 15 are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13.

The `get_primes()` method simply returns the list of primes that was computed during initialization.
