<<<Analysis>>>
In the provided code, the `Test.test()` method creates an instance of the `Thermostat` class with initial parameters: current_temperature = 20, target_temperature = 25, and mode = 'heat'. The method then calls `t.get_mode()` on this instance.

The `get_mode()` method of the `Thermostat` class simply returns the value of the instance's `mode` attribute. Since the mode was set to 'heat' during the initialization of the `Thermostat` instance and no other method was called to change the mode, the `get_mode()` method will return the string 'heat'.

<<<Output>>>
'heat'
