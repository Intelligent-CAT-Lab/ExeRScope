<<<Analysis>>>
The `Test.test()` method creates an instance of the `Manacher` class with the input string 'ababaxse'. It then calls the `palindromic_length` method on this instance with the parameters center=2, diff=1, and the string 'a|b|a|b|a|x|s|e'.

The `palindromic_length` method is designed to calculate the length of the palindrome centered at a given index (`center`) in the string, expanding outwards by `diff`. The method uses recursion to check if characters at positions `center - diff` and `center + diff` are the same and within the bounds of the string. If they are, it continues to check the next characters outward by increasing `diff` by 1 and adding 1 to the palindrome length.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown for the given parameters:
- Initial call: center=2, diff=1, string='a|b|a|b|a|x|s|e'
  - Checks characters at positions 1 ('|') and 3 ('|'). They are not the same.
  - The base case is met (characters are not the same), so it returns 0.

Since the characters at positions `center - diff` and `center + diff` are not the same right from the first recursive call, the method returns 0 immediately.
