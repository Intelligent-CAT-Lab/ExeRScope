<<<Analysis>>>
The `Test.test()` method initializes an instance of `MinesweeperGame` with parameters `n=1` and `k=4`. Here, `n=1` indicates that the game board is a 1x1 grid, and `k=4` suggests that 4 mines are to be placed on the board. However, since the board is only 1x1, it can accommodate only one mine, regardless of the value of `k`.

The `generate_playerMap()` method is called within the constructor of `MinesweeperGame`. This method creates a player map which is a 1x1 grid initialized with '-' indicating that the cell is not yet revealed. The method uses list comprehensions to create a 2D list filled with '-' characters based on the size `n`.

Given the size `n=1`, the player map will be a single cell grid with the initial unrevealed state represented by '-'.
