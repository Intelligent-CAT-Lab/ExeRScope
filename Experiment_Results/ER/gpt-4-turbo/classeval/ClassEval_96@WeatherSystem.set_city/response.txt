<<<Analysis>>>
The `Test.test()` method initializes an instance of the `WeatherSystem` class with the city 'New York'. Immediately after initialization, the `set_city` method is called with the argument 'Beijing'. This method updates the `city` attribute of the `WeatherSystem` instance to 'Beijing'. The method then returns the updated `city` attribute of the instance, which is now 'Beijing'.

<<<Output>>>
Beijing
