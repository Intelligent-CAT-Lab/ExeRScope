The `Test.test()` method performs several operations involving a SQLite database to test the functionality of the `UserLoginDB` class. Here's a breakdown of the steps:

1. **Database Setup**: A temporary database file `test_db.db` is created in the system's temporary directory. A connection to this database is established, and a cursor is obtained.

2. **Table Creation**: A SQL command is executed to create a table named `users` with two columns: `username` and `password`. This table is created only if it does not already exist.

3. **Inserting User**: An instance of `UserLoginDB` is created with the path to the temporary database. The `insert_user` method of this instance is called with the username 'user3' and password 'pass3'. This method inserts these values into the `users` table.

4. **Searching User**: The `search_user_by_username` method is called with the username 'user3'. This method queries the `users` table for a user with this username. Since the user was just inserted, the query should successfully find the user.

5. **Return Value**: The method returns a tuple containing the fetched user record and the individual fields (username and password) of this record. Given the operations performed, the user record should be `('user3', 'pass3')`.

The expected output should be the tuple containing the user record and its fields, which are `('user3', 'pass3')`.

<<<Output>>>
(('user3', 'pass3'), 'user3', 'pass3')
