The `Test.test()` method creates an instance of the `TriCalculator` class and then calls the `factorial` method with the argument 2. The `factorial` method is designed to compute the factorial of a given number `a` using a while loop. Here's the step-by-step breakdown of the `factorial` method when `a = 2`:
1. Initialize `b` to 1.
2. Enter the while loop since `a` is not 1.
3. Multiply `b` by `a` (b = 1 * 2 = 2).
4. Decrement `a` by 1 (a = 2 - 1 = 1).
5. The loop condition `a != 1` is now false, so exit the loop.
6. Return the value of `b`, which is now 2.

Thus, the method returns 2 when called with the argument 2.
