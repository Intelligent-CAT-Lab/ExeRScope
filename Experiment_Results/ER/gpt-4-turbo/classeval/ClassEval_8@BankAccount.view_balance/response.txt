<<<Analysis>>>
In the provided code, the `Test.test()` method is used to test the functionality of the `BankAccount` class. Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. An instance of `BankAccount` named `account1` is created. The constructor `__init__` is called with the default parameter `balance=0`. This sets the `balance` attribute of `account1` to 0.

2. The method `view_balance()` is called on `account1`. This method simply returns the current balance of the account, which is 0, as no deposits or withdrawals have been made since the account was created.

Thus, the method `view_balance()` will return 0 when called on `account1`.

<<<Output>>>
0
