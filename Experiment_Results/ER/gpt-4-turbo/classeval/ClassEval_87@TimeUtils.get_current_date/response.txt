<<<Analysis>>>
In the `Test.test()` method, an instance of the `TimeUtils` class is created. This instance initializes its `datetime` attribute to the current date and time at the moment of its creation.

The method then calls `get_current_date()` on the `timeutils` instance. This method formats the `datetime` attribute of the instance to a string in the format "%Y-%m-%d", which represents the current date in the year-month-day format.

Next, the method directly accesses the `datetime` attribute of the `timeutils` instance and formats it to the same string format "%Y-%m-%d" using the `strftime` method.

Since both the `get_current_date()` method and the direct formatting of the `datetime` attribute use the same format and are executed sequentially with negligible time difference, they will both return the same date string representing the current date.

Therefore, the output of `Test.test()` will be a tuple containing the same current date string twice.

<<<Output>>>
("YYYY-MM-DD", "YYYY-MM-DD")  # Replace YYYY-MM-DD with the actual current date
