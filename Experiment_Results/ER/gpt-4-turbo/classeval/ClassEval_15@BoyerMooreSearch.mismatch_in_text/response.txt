<<<Analysis>>>
The `Test.test()` method creates an instance of `BoyerMooreSearch` with the text "ABAABA" and the pattern "ABC". It then calls the `mismatch_in_text()` method with the argument `3`.

The `mismatch_in_text()` method checks for mismatches between the pattern and the text starting from the given position (in this case, position 3). The pattern length (`patLen`) is 3.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown:
- The loop iterates over the pattern from the last character to the first.
- i=2 (last character of the pattern): Compares `pattern[2]` ('C') with `text[3+2]` ('A'). Since 'C' != 'A', it returns the mismatch index, which is `3+2=5`.

Thus, the first mismatch is found at index 5 of the text.

5
