<<<Analysis>>>
The `Test.test()` method initializes a new instance of `BlackjackGame`. It then defines two hands: `player_hand` with cards ['2S', '4S', '5S'] and `dealer_hand` with cards ['2S', 'JS', 'QS'].

The `check_winner()` method is called with these hands. Inside `check_winner()`, the `calculate_hand_value()` method is called for both the player's and dealer's hands to determine their respective values.

For the player's hand:
- '2S' contributes 2 to the total.
- '4S' contributes 4 to the total.
- '5S' contributes 5 to the total.
The total value of the player's hand is 2 + 4 + 5 = 11.

For the dealer's hand:
- '2S' contributes 2 to the total.
- 'JS' contributes 10 to the total (as face cards J, Q, K count as 10).
- 'QS' also contributes 10 to the total.
The total value of the dealer's hand is 2 + 10 + 10 = 22.

After calculating the hand values:
- Player's hand value = 11
- Dealer's hand value = 22

According to the rules defined in `check_winner()`:
- If both player and dealer have values over 21, the one with the value closest to 21 wins. However, in this case, only the dealer's value is over 21.
- Since the dealer's value exceeds 21 and the player's does not, the player wins.

Thus, the method will return 'Player wins'.

Player wins
