<<<Analysis>>>
The `multiply` method of the `BigNumCalculator` class is designed to multiply two large numbers represented as strings. The method uses a manual multiplication approach similar to how multiplication is performed by hand.

1. The method first determines the lengths of the two input strings `num1` and `num2`.
2. It initializes a result list of zeros with a length equal to the sum of the lengths of `num1` and `num2`.
3. The method then iterates over each digit of `num1` and `num2` in reverse order (from least significant to most significant digit).
4. For each pair of digits, it calculates the product and adds it to the appropriate position in the result list, taking into account any carry from previous calculations.
5. After processing all digit pairs, the method adjusts for any carries that might propagate through the result list.
6. Finally, it converts the result list into a string, removing any leading zeros.

For the specific input values '923456789' and '187654321':
- The lengths of the numbers are 9 each.
- The result list initially has 18 zeros.
- The method performs digit-by-digit multiplication and accumulates the results in the appropriate positions of the result list.
- After processing all digits and adjusting for carries, the method constructs the final result string from the list.

The multiplication of '923456789' by '187654321' is computed step by step, and the final result is obtained by converting the list to a string and stripping leading zeros.
