<<<Analysis>>>
The `Test.test()` method creates an instance of the `BinaryDataProcessor` class with the input string "0sd1000daf3e4r01100101011011addf0110001d1111". The constructor of `BinaryDataProcessor` initializes the instance variable `binary_string` with this input and then calls the `clean_non_binary_chars()` method.

The `clean_non_binary_chars()` method filters out any characters from the `binary_string` that are not '0' or '1'. This is done using a lambda function within the `filter()` method, which checks if each character is in the string '01'. The result is then joined back into a string and assigned back to `binary_string`.

The input string "0sd1000daf3e4r01100101011011addf0110001d1111" contains several non-binary characters. After filtering, only the binary characters remain:
- Original: "0sd1000daf3e4r01100101011011addf0110001d1111"
- Filtered: "01000110100101101101100011111"

The `test()` method then returns the cleaned `binary_string`.
