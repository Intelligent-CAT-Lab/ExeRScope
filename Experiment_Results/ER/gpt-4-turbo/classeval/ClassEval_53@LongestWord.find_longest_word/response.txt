<<<Analysis>>>
The `Test.test()` method initializes an instance of the `LongestWord` class and adds the word "a" to its word list. It then defines a sentence "I am a student." and calls the `find_longest_word` method with this sentence.

1. The `find_longest_word` method first converts the sentence to lowercase, resulting in "i am a student.".
2. It then removes punctuation using a regular expression, which strips the period at the end, resulting in "i am a student".
3. The sentence is split into words based on spaces, resulting in the list `['i', 'am', 'a', 'student']`.
4. The method iterates through each word in this list. It checks if the word is in the `word_list` and if its length is greater than the current `longest_word`.
5. The word "a" is found in `word_list`, and since `longest_word` is initially an empty string, "a" becomes the new `longest_word`.
6. No other words in the sentence are in the `word_list`, so the method returns "a" as the longest word found that matches the criteria.

<<<Output>>>
a
