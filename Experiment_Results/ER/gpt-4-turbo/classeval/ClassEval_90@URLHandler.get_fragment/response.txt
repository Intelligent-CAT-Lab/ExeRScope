<<<Analysis>>>
The `Test.test()` method creates an instance of the `URLHandler` class with the URL "https://www.baidu.com/s?wd=aaa&rsv_spt=1#bbb". It then calls the `get_fragment()` method on this instance.

The `get_fragment()` method is designed to extract the fragment part of the URL, which is the part after the "#" character. Here's how it works:
1. The method finds the position of the "#" character in the URL using `self.url.find("#")`.
2. If the "#" character is found (i.e., `fragment_start` is not -1), it slices the URL string from the character immediately following "#" to the end of the string.
3. If the "#" character is not found, it returns `None`.

In the given URL "https://www.baidu.com/s?wd=aaa&rsv_spt=1#bbb":
- The `fragment_start` is found at position 39.
- The method then slices the URL from position 40 to the end, resulting in the string "bbb".

Thus, the `get_fragment()` method should return "bbb".

<<<Output>>>
bbb
