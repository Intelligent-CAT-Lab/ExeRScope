<<<Analysis>>>
The `Test.test()` method initializes a new instance of the `ShoppingCart` class. The `ShoppingCart` class has methods to add items, remove items, view items, and calculate the total price of items in the cart.

1. A `ShoppingCart` instance is created, initializing an empty dictionary `items`.
2. The `add_item` method is called with arguments "apple", 1, and 1. This adds an item "apple" with a price of 1 and quantity of 1 to the `items` dictionary.
3. The `add_item` method is called again with arguments "banana", 2, and 1. This adds another item "banana" with a price of 2 and quantity of 1 to the `items` dictionary.
4. The `total_price` method is called to calculate the total price of the items in the cart. It iterates over the `items` dictionary values and calculates the sum of the products of the price and quantity for each item:
   - For "apple": 1 (price) * 1 (quantity) = 1
   - For "banana": 2 (price) * 1 (quantity) = 2
   - Total price = 1 + 2 = 3

The method returns the total price, which is 3.
