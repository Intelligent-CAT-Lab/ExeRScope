The method `_to_camel_case` of the `CamelCaseMap` class is called with the string 'first_name' as an argument. This method is designed to convert snake_case strings to camelCase.

1. The input string 'first_name' is split into parts using the underscore as a delimiter, resulting in the list `['first', 'name']`.
2. The method then constructs a new string. The first element of the list ('first') remains unchanged.
3. The subsequent elements are transformed by capitalizing the first letter of each part. In this case, 'name' becomes 'Name'.
4. These parts are then concatenated together, resulting in 'firstName'.

Thus, the method transforms 'first_name' to 'firstName'.

<<<Output>>>
firstName
