<<<Analysis>>>
The `Test.test()` method initializes an instance of the `Thermostat` class with the parameters `current_temperature=20`, `target_temperature=25`, and `mode='heat'`. 
The `set_mode()` method of the `Thermostat` class is then called with the argument `'cool'`. This method checks if the provided mode is either `'heat'` or `'cool'`. Since `'cool'` is a valid mode, it sets the thermostat's mode to `'cool'`.
After setting the mode, the `get_mode()` method is called, which simply returns the current mode of the thermostat, which is now `'cool'`.
<<<Output>>>
'cool'
