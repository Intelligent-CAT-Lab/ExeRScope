<<<Analysis>>>
The `Test.test()` method initializes a `DiscountStrategy` object with a customer, a cart, and a promotion strategy (`FidelityPromo`). The customer has a fidelity score of 1800, which qualifies for a discount under the `FidelityPromo` strategy. The cart contains two items: one with a quantity of 10 and price of 20.0, and another with a quantity of 5 and price of 10.0.

1. The `DiscountStrategy` constructor is called with the customer, cart, and `FidelityPromo` as the promotion.
2. Inside the constructor, the `total()` method is called to calculate the total price of the cart:
   - For the first item: 10 * 20.0 = 200.0
   - For the second item: 5 * 10.0 = 50.0
   - Total cart value = 200.0 + 50.0 = 250.0
3. The `FidelityPromo` static method is then used as the promotion strategy. This method checks if the customer's fidelity score is 1000 or more, which it is (1800). Therefore, it applies a 5% discount:
   - Discount = 250.0 * 0.05 = 12.5
4. The `test()` method then calculates the actual discount using the promotion method directly and compares it to an expected discount value of 12.5.

The expected output is the actual discount calculated and the expected discount value.

<<<Output>>>
(12.5, 12.5)
