<<<Analysis>>>
In the test() method, an instance of JobMarketplace is created named jobMarketplace. Initially, both job_listings and resumes lists are empty. The resumes list is then manually set to contain one resume, which belongs to "Tom" with skills ['skill1', 'skill2'] and "experience".

The method withdraw_resume() is called with the first (and only) resume in the resumes list as the argument. This method removes the specified resume from the resumes list.

After the resume is removed, the resumes list becomes empty. The method then returns the current state of the resumes list, which is empty.
