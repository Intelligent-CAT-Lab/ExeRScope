<<<Analysis>>>
The `test()` method in the `Test` class initializes an instance of `JobMarketplace`. It then manually sets the `resumes` and `job_listings` attributes of this instance. The `resumes` list contains two resumes for "Tom" and "John" with different sets of skills. The `job_listings` list contains one job listing for a "Software Engineer" position at "ABC Company" with requirements for 'skill6' and 'skill7'.

The method then calls `get_job_applicants()` on the job listing for "Software Engineer". This method iterates over each resume in the `resumes` list and checks if the resume matches the job requirements using the `matches_requirements()` method.

The `matches_requirements()` method checks if all skills in the resume are present in the job's requirements. For both resumes:
- Tom's skills are 'skill1' and 'skill2', neither of which matches 'skill6' or 'skill7'.
- John's skills are 'skill3' and 'skill4', neither of which matches 'skill6' or 'skill7'.

Since neither resume matches the job requirements, the list of applicants will be empty.
