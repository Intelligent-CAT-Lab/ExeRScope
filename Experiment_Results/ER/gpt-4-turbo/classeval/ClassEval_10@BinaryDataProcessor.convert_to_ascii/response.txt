<<<Analysis>>>
The `Test.test()` method creates an instance of `BinaryDataProcessor` with the binary string "01101000011011010110001001101111". The constructor of `BinaryDataProcessor` initializes the instance variable `binary_string` and then calls `clean_non_binary_chars()` method. This method filters out any characters that are not '0' or '1'. However, since the input string contains only '0' and '1', the binary string remains unchanged.

Next, the `convert_to_ascii()` method is called. This method processes the binary string in chunks of 8 bits (1 byte) and converts each byte to its corresponding ASCII character:
- The first 8 bits "01101000" correspond to the decimal value 104, which is the ASCII character 'h'.
- The next 8 bits "01101101" correspond to the decimal value 109, which is the ASCII character 'm'.
- The following 8 bits "01100010" correspond to the decimal value 98, which is the ASCII character 'b'.
- The last 8 bits "01101111" correspond to the decimal value 111, which is the ASCII character 'o'.

These characters are combined to form the string "hmbo".
