The `Test.test()` method calls the `VectorUtil.similarity(vector_1, vector_2)` method with two vectors, both being `[1, 1]`. The `similarity` method computes the cosine similarity between two vectors using the dot product of their unit vectors.

1. The `matutils.unitvec` function is used to convert each vector into a unit vector. A unit vector is a vector of length 1, which is calculated by dividing each component of the vector by its magnitude (Euclidean norm).
2. For both `vector_1` and `vector_2`, the magnitude is `sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2)`. Thus, each unit vector becomes `[1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)]`.
3. The dot product of these unit vectors is calculated as `(1/sqrt(2) * 1/sqrt(2)) + (1/sqrt(2) * 1/sqrt(2)) = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1`.
4. Since the vectors are identical and normalized, their cosine similarity is 1, indicating perfect similarity.

Thus, the method returns a similarity score of 1.
