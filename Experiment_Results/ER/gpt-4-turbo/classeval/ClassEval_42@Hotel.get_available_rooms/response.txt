<<<Analysis>>>
The `Test.test()` method initializes a `Hotel` object with the name 'Test Hotel' and a dictionary of available rooms: {'single': 3, 'double': 2, 'triple': 2}. This means initially there are 3 single rooms, 2 double rooms, and 2 triple rooms available.

The method then calls `book_room('single', 3, 'guest 1')` on the hotel object. This method checks if there are enough single rooms available to fulfill the booking request for 3 rooms. Since there are exactly 3 single rooms available, the booking is successful. The method updates the `booked_rooms` dictionary to include 'guest 1' with 3 booked single rooms and decreases the count of available single rooms to 0.

Finally, `get_available_rooms('single')` is called, which returns the number of available single rooms. Since all single rooms were booked by 'guest 1', the number of available single rooms is now 0.
