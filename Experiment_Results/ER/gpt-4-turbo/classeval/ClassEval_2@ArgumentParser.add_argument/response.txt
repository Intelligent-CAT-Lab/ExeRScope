The `Test.test()` method initializes an instance of the `ArgumentParser` class and then adds three arguments to it using the `add_argument` method. Here's a breakdown of the steps and the internal state changes:

1. An instance of `ArgumentParser` is created. This initializes:
   - `self.arguments` as an empty dictionary `{}`.
   - `self.required` as an empty set `set()`.
   - `self.types` as an empty dictionary `{}`.

2. The `add_argument` method is called with the argument "name":
   - Since the `required` parameter defaults to `False` and is not specified, "name" is not added to the `self.required` set.
   - The `arg_type` defaults to `str`, so `self.types` is updated to `{'name': str}`.

3. The `add_argument` method is called with the argument "age", with `required=False` and `arg_type=int`:
   - "age" is not added to the `self.required` set because `required` is `False`.
   - `self.types` is updated to include `{'age': int}`.

4. The `add_argument` method is called with the argument "verbose", with `arg_type=bool`:
   - "verbose" is not added to the `self.required` set because `required` is not specified and defaults to `False`.
   - `self.types` is updated to include `{'verbose': bool}`.

Finally, the method returns the current state of `self.required`, an empty set (since no arguments were added as required), and `self.types`, which now contains the types for each argument.

<<<Output>>>
(set(), set(), {'name': str, 'age': int, 'verbose': bool})
