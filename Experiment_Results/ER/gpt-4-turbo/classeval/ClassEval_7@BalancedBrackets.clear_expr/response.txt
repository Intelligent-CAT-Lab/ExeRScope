<<<Analysis>>>
The `Test.test()` method creates an instance of the `BalancedBrackets` class with the expression "[a](b){c}". The `clear_expr()` method of this class is then called on this instance.

The `clear_expr()` method is designed to filter out all characters from the `expr` attribute of the instance that are not brackets. It does this by iterating over each character in `expr` and including it in a new string only if it is one of the characters in `self.left_brackets` or `self.right_brackets`. These lists contain the characters "(", "{", "[", ")", "}", and "]".

In the given expression "[a](b){c}", the characters that are brackets are "[", "(", ")", "{", and "}". The `clear_expr()` method will thus transform the expression to "[(){}]".

After the `clear_expr()` method is called, the `test()` method returns the modified `expr` attribute of the `BalancedBrackets` instance, which is now "[(){}]".
