<<<Analysis>>>
In the `test()` method of the `Test` class, an instance of `TwentyFourPointGame` is created. The method `evaluate_expression('4*3+6+6')` is then called on this instance.

The `evaluate_expression()` method is designed to evaluate a given arithmetic expression and check if the result equals 24. The method uses Python's built-in `eval()` function to compute the result of the expression.

The expression '4*3+6+6' is evaluated as follows:
- 4 * 3 = 12
- 12 + 6 = 18
- 18 + 6 = 24

Since the result of the expression is 24, the method should return `True`.

<<<Output>>>
True
