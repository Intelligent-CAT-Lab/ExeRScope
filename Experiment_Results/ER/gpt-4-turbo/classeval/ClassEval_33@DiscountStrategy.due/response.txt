<<<Analysis>>>
The `Test.test()` method initializes a `DiscountStrategy` object with a customer, a cart, and a promotion strategy (`FidelityPromo`). The customer has a fidelity score of 900, and the cart contains two items with specified quantities and prices.

1. The `DiscountStrategy` constructor is called with the customer, cart, and `FidelityPromo` as the promotion.
2. Inside the constructor, the `total()` method is called to calculate the total price of the cart:
   - The total is calculated as `(10 * 20.0) + (5 * 10.0) = 200 + 50 = 250.0`.
3. The `due()` method is then called to calculate the amount due after applying the promotion:
   - Since the `FidelityPromo` is used, it checks if the customer's fidelity score is 1000 or more to apply a 5% discount. Here, the fidelity score is 900, which is less than 1000, so no discount is applied.
   - The discount is 0, and thus the due amount is `250.0 - 0 = 250.0`.

The `test()` method returns a tuple containing the actual due amount and the expected due amount, both of which are 250.0.

<<<Output>>>
(250.0, 250.0)
