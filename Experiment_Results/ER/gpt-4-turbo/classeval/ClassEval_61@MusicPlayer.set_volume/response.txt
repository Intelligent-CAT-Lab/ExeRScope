<<<Analysis>>>
In the test() method, an instance of MusicPlayer is created. The constructor initializes the playlist as an empty list, sets the current_song to None, and sets the volume to 50.

The method set_volume(100) is then called on the musicPlayer instance. This method checks if the provided volume value is between 0 and 100. Since 100 is within this range, the volume of the musicPlayer instance is set to 100. The method does not explicitly return any value, so it returns None by default.

Finally, the test method returns a tuple containing the result of the set_volume method (which is None) and the current volume of the musicPlayer instance (which is now 100).

<<<Output>>>
(None, 100)
