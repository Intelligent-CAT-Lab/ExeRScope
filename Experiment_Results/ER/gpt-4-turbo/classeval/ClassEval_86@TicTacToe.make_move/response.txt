<<<Analysis>>>
The `Test.test()` method initializes an instance of the `TicTacToe` class with the default size of 3x3 for the board. The `current_player` is initialized to 'X'.

1. The `current_player` is 'X' at the beginning.
2. The `make_move(0, 0)` method is called:
   - The move is made at position (0, 0) on the board.
   - The `current_player` is switched to 'O'.
   - The method returns `True` because the move was successful.
3. The `make_move(0, 1)` method is called:
   - The move is made at position (0, 1) on the board.
   - The `current_player` is switched back to 'X'.
   - The method returns `True` because the move was successful.
4. The `make_move(0, 0)` method is called again:
   - This position is already occupied by 'X' from the first move.
   - The method returns `False` because the move was unsuccessful.
5. The `current_player` remains 'X' because the last move was not successful.

The method returns a tuple containing the initial `current_player`, the results of the three `make_move` calls, and the final `current_player`.

<<<Output>>>
('X', True, True, False, 'X')
