<<<Analysis>>>
In the `Test.test()` method, an instance of `NLPDataProcessor` is created. The method then defines a list of strings `string_list` containing three sentences. An empty list `stop_word_list` is also defined, which is intended to contain stop words but is left empty in this test case.

The `remove_stop_words` method of `NLPDataProcessor` is called with `string_list` and the empty `stop_word_list`. Inside `remove_stop_words`, an empty list `answer` is initialized to store the results. The method iterates over each string in `string_list`, splits the string into words, and checks each word against the `stop_word_list`. Since `stop_word_list` is empty, no words are removed from any string. Each list of words (unchanged from the original string) is then appended to `answer`.

The expected output `expected_words_list` is defined to be a list of lists, where each inner list contains the words of the corresponding string in `string_list` split by spaces. However, since the `stop_word_list` is empty, the actual output `words_list` will be identical to `expected_words_list`.

Thus, the method will return a tuple containing `words_list` and `expected_words_list`, both of which are identical and represent the original strings split into lists of words without any words removed.
