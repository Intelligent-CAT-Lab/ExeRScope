<<<Analysis>>>
The `Test.test()` method initializes an instance of the `AssessmentSystem` class and manually sets the `students` dictionary with three students: Alice, Bob, and Charlie. Each student has a name, grade, major, and a dictionary of courses with their respective scores.

- Alice has no courses listed.
- Bob has one course, Physics, with a score of 85.
- Charlie has two courses, Chemistry with a score of 70 and Physics with a score of 80.

The `get_top_student()` method is then called on the `assessment_system` instance. This method iterates through each student, calculates their GPA using the `get_gpa()` method, and determines the student with the highest GPA.

- For Alice, the GPA calculation returns `None` because she has no courses.
- For Bob, the GPA is calculated as 85 (since he has only one course).
- For Charlie, the GPA is calculated as the average of his two scores: (70 + 80) / 2 = 75.

The method compares the GPAs:
- Alice's GPA is `None`, so she is not considered.
- Bob's GPA of 85 is higher than Charlie's GPA of 75.

Thus, Bob is determined to be the top student based on the highest GPA.

'Bob'
