The `Test.test()` method calls the `DataStatistics4.kurtosis([1, 5, 3])` method. The purpose of this method is to calculate the kurtosis of a given dataset. Here, the dataset is [1, 5, 3].

1. **Calculate the Mean**: 
   - The mean of the data [1, 5, 3] is calculated as (1 + 5 + 3) / 3 = 3.

2. **Calculate the Standard Deviation**:
   - The variance is calculated using the formula: sum((x - mean) ** 2 for x in data) / n.
   - For each x in [1, 5, 3], the squared differences from the mean are (1-3)^2 = 4, (5-3)^2 = 4, and (3-3)^2 = 0.
   - The variance is (4 + 4 + 0) / 3 = 8 / 3.
   - The standard deviation (std_dev) is the square root of the variance, which is sqrt(8/3).

3. **Calculate the Fourth Moment**:
   - The centered data is calculated as [x - mean for x in data], resulting in [1-3, 5-3, 3-3] = [-2, 2, 0].
   - The fourth moment is calculated using the formula: sum(x ** 4 for x in centered_data) / n.
   - The fourth powers of the centered data are (-2)^4 = 16, 2^4 = 16, and 0^4 = 0.
   - The fourth moment is (16 + 16 + 0) / 3 = 32 / 3.

4. **Calculate Kurtosis**:
   - Kurtosis is calculated using the formula: (fourth_moment / std_dev ** 4) - 3.
   - std_dev ** 4 = (sqrt(8/3))^4 = 8/3 * 8/3 = 64/9.
   - Kurtosis = (32/3) / (64/9) - 3 = (32/3) * (9/64) - 3 = 9/6 - 3 = 1.5 - 3 = -1.5.

The kurtosis of the data [1, 5, 3] is -1.5.

<<<Output>>>
-1.5
