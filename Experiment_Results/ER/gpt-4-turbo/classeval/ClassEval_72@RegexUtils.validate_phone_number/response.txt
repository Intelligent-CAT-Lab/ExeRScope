<<<Analysis>>>
The `test()` method in the `Test` class creates an instance of `RegexUtils` and then calls the `validate_phone_number` method with the input "1234567890".

1. Inside `validate_phone_number`, the method `generate_phone_number_pattern` is called to get the regex pattern for validating phone numbers. The pattern returned is `r'\b\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}\b'`, which matches phone numbers formatted as "XXX-XXX-XXXX" where X is a digit.

2. The `match` method of `RegexUtils` is then called with the pattern `r'\b\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}\b'` and the text "1234567890".

3. Inside the `match` method, `re.match` is used to check if the beginning of the string matches the pattern. Since "1234567890" does not have dashes separating groups of three and four digits as required by the pattern, `re.match` returns `None`.

4. The `match` method then checks if the result from `re.match` is truthy. Since it is `None`, the method returns `False`.

Therefore, the `validate_phone_number` method returns `False` because the input "1234567890" does not match the required phone number format.
