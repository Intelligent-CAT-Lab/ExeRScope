<<<Analysis>>>
The `Test.test()` method calls the `HtmlUtil._HtmlUtil__format_line_feed()` method with the string 'aaa\n\n\n\n' as an argument. This method is designed to format line feeds in a text by replacing multiple newline characters (`\n`) with a single newline character.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown of the method:
1. The method uses the `re.sub()` function from the `re` module to substitute occurrences of the regex pattern `r'\n+'` with a single `'\n'`. The pattern `r'\n+'` matches one or more newline characters.
2. The input string 'aaa\n\n\n\n' contains four consecutive newline characters. According to the regex pattern, these will be replaced by a single newline character.
3. The resulting string after substitution will be 'aaa\n'.

Thus, the method returns the string 'aaa\n' after processing.

<<<Output>>>
'aaa\n'
