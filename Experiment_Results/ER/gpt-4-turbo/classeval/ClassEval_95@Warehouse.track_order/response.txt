<<<Analysis>>>
The `Test.test()` method performs the following operations:
1. A `Warehouse` object is instantiated. This initializes two dictionaries: `inventory` and `orders`.
2. The `add_product` method is called with parameters `product_id=1`, `name='product 5'`, and `quantity=100`. This adds a product with ID 1, name 'product 5', and quantity 100 to the `inventory` dictionary.
3. The `create_order` method is called with parameters `order_id=1`, `product_id=1`, and `quantity=10`. Inside this method:
   - The `get_product_quantity` method is called to check if the quantity of product ID 1 is sufficient (>=10). It returns 100, which is sufficient.
   - The `update_product_quantity` method is then called to reduce the quantity of product ID 1 by 10, updating the quantity from 100 to 90.
   - An order with `order_id=1` is created in the `orders` dictionary with details including the `product_id`, `quantity`, and `status` set to 'Shipped'.
4. The `track_order` method is called with `order_id=1` to retrieve the status of the order. It finds the order in the `orders` dictionary and returns the status 'Shipped'.

<<<Output>>>
'Shipped'
