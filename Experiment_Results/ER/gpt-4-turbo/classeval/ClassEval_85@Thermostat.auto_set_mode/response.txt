<<<Analysis>>>
In the `Test.test()` method, an instance of the `Thermostat` class is created with the parameters `current_temperature=25`, `target_temperature=25`, and `mode='cool'`. The `auto_set_mode()` method is then called on this instance.

The `auto_set_mode()` method checks if the `current_temperature` is less than the `target_temperature`. If true, it sets the mode to 'heat'. If false, it sets the mode to 'cool'. In this case, since `current_temperature` is equal to `target_temperature`, the method sets the mode to 'cool' as per the else condition.

After setting the mode, the `get_mode()` method is called, which simply returns the current mode of the thermostat, which is 'cool'.

Thus, the output of the `Test.test()` method will be 'cool'.
