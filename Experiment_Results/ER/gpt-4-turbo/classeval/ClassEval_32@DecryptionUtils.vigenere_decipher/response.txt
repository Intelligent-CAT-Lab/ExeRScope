The `Test.test()` method creates an instance of `DecryptionUtils` with the key 'key' and then calls the `vigenere_decipher` method with the ciphertext 'ifmmp'.

The `vigenere_decipher` method decrypts the ciphertext using the VigenÃ¨re cipher technique. The decryption process involves the following steps:
1. Initialize `decrypted_text` as an empty string and `key_index` as 0.
2. Iterate through each character in the ciphertext:
   - For each alphabetic character, calculate the shift using the ASCII value of the corresponding character in the key (repeated cyclically) subtracted by the ASCII value of 'a'.
   - Adjust the character by subtracting the shift from its ASCII value, wrapping around using modulo 26, and converting it back to a character.
   - Append the decrypted character to `decrypted_text`, maintaining the case (uppercase or lowercase) of the original character.
   - Non-alphabetic characters are appended directly to `decrypted_text` without decryption.
3. The key 'key' corresponds to shifts of 10, 4, and 24 for 'k', 'e', and 'y' respectively.

Step-by-step decryption of 'ifmmp':
- 'i' (shift 10): 'i' -> 'y'
- 'f' (shift 4): 'f' -> 'b'
- 'm' (shift 24): 'm' -> 'o'
- 'm' (shift 10): 'm' -> 'c'
- 'p' (shift 4): 'p' -> 'l'

Thus, the decrypted text is 'ybocl'.
