The `subtract` method of the `BigNumCalculator` class is called with the inputs '12345678901234567' and '98765432109876543210'. The method is designed to subtract the second number from the first.

1. The method first checks if `num1` is shorter than `num2`. In this case, it is true, so `num1` and `num2` are swapped, and a flag `negative` is set to `True` to indicate the result will be negative.

2. Both numbers are then zero-padded to the same length for straightforward subtraction.

3. The subtraction is performed digit by digit from right to left. If a borrow is needed (when the digit of `num1` is less than the corresponding digit of `num2`), the borrow is noted, and 10 is added to the current digit difference.

4. After the loop, leading zeros are removed from the result list.

5. Since the `negative` flag is `True`, a '-' is added at the beginning of the result list.

6. The list of characters is joined to form the final result string.

The subtraction operation essentially calculates `98765432109876543210 - 12345678901234567`, which results in `98765419764197641943`. Since `num1` was originally smaller, the result is negative.
