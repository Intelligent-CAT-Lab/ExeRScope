The `Test.test()` method performs several operations using the `Server` class:
1. An instance of `Server` is created. This initializes `white_list`, `send_struct`, and `receive_struct` as empty.
2. The `add_white_list` method is called with the argument 66. Since 66 is not in `white_list`, it is added to the list, and the updated list `[66]` is returned.
3. The `send` method is called with a dictionary `{"addr": 22, "content": "abc"}`. The method checks if the dictionary structure is correct and then updates `send_struct` to `{"addr": 22, "content": "abc"}`. The method does not return any value.
4. The `recv` method is called with a dictionary `{"addr": 66, "content": "ABC"}`. The method checks if the dictionary structure is correct and if the address 66 is in the `white_list`. Since 66 is in the `white_list`, it updates `receive_struct` to `{"addr": 66, "content": "ABC"}` and returns the content `"ABC"`.
5. Finally, the `show` method is called with the argument `'send'`. This method returns the current state of `send_struct`, which is `{"addr": 22, "content": "abc"}`.

<<<Output>>>
{'addr': 22, 'content': 'abc'}
