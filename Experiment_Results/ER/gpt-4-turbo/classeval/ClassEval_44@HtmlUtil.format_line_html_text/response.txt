<<<Analysis>>>
The `Test.test()` method creates an instance of the `HtmlUtil` class and then calls the `format_line_html_text` method with a simple HTML string containing a paragraph element (`<p>Some sentence here.</p>`).

1. The `format_line_html_text` method first checks if the input HTML text is None or empty. In this case, it is not, so it proceeds.
2. A BeautifulSoup object (`soup`) is created using the input HTML text and the 'lxml' parser.
3. The method then searches for `<pre>` and `<blockquote>` tags to replace their content with the `CODE_MARK`. Since there are none in the input HTML, this step does not modify the HTML.
4. It searches for `<ul>` and `<ol>` tags to format list items, but none are present in the input HTML, so this step also does not modify the HTML.
5. The method then processes `<p>` tags. It finds one `<p>` tag with the text "Some sentence here.". Since the text ends with a punctuation mark (a period), it sets the string of the `<p>` tag to the same text without modification.
6. The method then converts the modified HTML back to text using `soup.get_text()`, which results in the string "Some sentence here.".
7. Finally, the `__format_line_feed` method is called to format line feeds. It replaces multiple newline characters with a single newline. Since there are no multiple newlines in "Some sentence here.", the text remains unchanged.

The final output is the text "Some sentence here." with no additional modifications or formatting applied.

<<<Output>>>
Some sentence here.
