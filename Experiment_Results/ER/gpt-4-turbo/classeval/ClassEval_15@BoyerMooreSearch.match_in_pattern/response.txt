<<<Analysis>>>
The `Test.test()` method creates an instance of the `BoyerMooreSearch` class with the text "ABAABA" and the pattern "ABAB". It then calls the `match_in_pattern` method with the character 'B'.

The `match_in_pattern` method iterates through the pattern "ABAB" from the last character to the first. It checks if the character 'B' matches any character in the pattern. The iteration steps are as follows:
- First iteration: i=3, pattern[3] = 'B'. Since 'B' matches the input character 'B', the method returns the index 3.

Thus, the method returns 3 as the index of the last occurrence of 'B' in the pattern "ABAB".

<<<Output>>>
3
