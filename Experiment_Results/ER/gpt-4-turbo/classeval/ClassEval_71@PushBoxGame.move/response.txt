<<<Analysis>>>
The `PushBoxGame` class is initialized with a game map. The `init_game` method is called during initialization to set up the game state. It identifies the player's starting position, the positions of boxes, and the targets on the map.

1. The game map is:
   ```
   "#####",
   "#O  #",
   "# X #",
   "#  G#",
   "#####"
   ```
   - 'O' represents the player's starting position at (1, 1).
   - 'X' represents a box at (2, 2).
   - 'G' represents a target at (3, 3).

2. The `move` method is called with the direction 's' (south), which means the player attempts to move down from (1, 1) to (2, 1).
   - The new position (2, 1) is empty (a space), so the player moves successfully to (2, 1).

3. After moving, the `check_win` method is called to determine if all boxes are on target positions.
   - Since there is only one box and it is not on the target (box at (2, 2) and target at (3, 3)), the game is not over.

The final state after the move:
- Player's position: (2, 1)
- Box's position: unchanged at (2, 2)
- Game over status: False

<<<Output>>>
(1, 2, False)
