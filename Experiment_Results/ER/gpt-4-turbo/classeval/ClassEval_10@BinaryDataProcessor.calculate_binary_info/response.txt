<<<Analysis>>>
The `Test.test()` method creates an instance of `BinaryDataProcessor` with the binary string "011010011111001". The constructor of `BinaryDataProcessor` initializes the instance variable `binary_string` and then calls the `clean_non_binary_chars()` method.

The `clean_non_binary_chars()` method filters out any characters from the `binary_string` that are not '0' or '1'. In this case, the input string "011010011111001" contains only binary characters, so the string remains unchanged.

Next, the `calculate_binary_info()` method is called on the `BinaryDataProcessor` instance. This method calculates the count of '0's and '1's in the binary string, as well as the total length of the string. The binary string "011010011111001" has a length of 15 characters, with 5 '0's and 10 '1's.

The method then calculates the percentage of '0's and '1's in the string:
- Zeroes percentage = 5/15 = 0.3333 (approximately)
- Ones percentage = 10/15 = 0.6667 (approximately)

Finally, the method returns a dictionary containing the percentages of '0's and '1's, and the total bit length of the binary string.

<<<Output>>>
{'Zeroes': 0.3333333333333333, 'Ones': 0.6666666666666666, 'Bit length': 15}
