<<<Analysis>>>
The `Test.test()` method creates an instance of the `BalancedBrackets` class with the expression "a(b{c]]". The `check_balanced_brackets()` method is then called on this instance.

1. **Initialization**: The `BalancedBrackets` constructor initializes the instance with an empty stack, lists of left and right brackets, and the expression "a(b{c]]".

2. **Clear Expression**: The `clear_expr()` method is called to filter out non-bracket characters from the expression. The resulting expression becomes "(b{c]]".

3. **Check Balanced Brackets**:
   - The method iterates over the cleaned expression "(b{c]]".
   - For '(': It is a left bracket, so it is added to the stack.
   - For 'b': It is not a bracket, so it is ignored.
   - For '{': It is a left bracket, so it is added to the stack.
   - For 'c': It is not a bracket, so it is ignored.
   - For ']': It is a right bracket. The method pops the top of the stack, which is '{'. Since '{' does not match with ']', the method returns `False`.
   - The method does not proceed further as it has already determined the brackets are not balanced.

4. **Return Value**: The method returns `False` because the brackets are not balanced.
