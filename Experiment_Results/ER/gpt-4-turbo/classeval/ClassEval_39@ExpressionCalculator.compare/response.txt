<<<Analysis>>>
The `Test.test()` method creates an instance of `ExpressionCalculator` and then calls the `compare` method with the operators `*` and `+` as arguments.

The `compare` method is designed to determine the precedence of two operators. It uses a list `operat_priority` where the indices correspond to the ASCII values of the operators minus 40. The operators are `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `(`, `)`, `,`, and `%`. The precedence values are `[0, 3, 2, 1, -1, 1, 0, 2]`.

For the operators `*` and `+`:
- ASCII value of `*` is 42, and `42 - 40` gives index 2 in `operat_priority`, which corresponds to a precedence value of 2.
- ASCII value of `+` is 43, and `43 - 40` gives index 3 in `operat_priority`, which corresponds to a precedence value of 1.

The `compare` method checks if the precedence of the operator at the top of the stack (`peek_op`, which is `+` in this case) is greater than or equal to the precedence of the current operator (`cur`, which is `*`). Since the precedence value of `*` (2) is greater than the precedence value of `+` (1), the method returns `False`.
