The `test()` method in the `Test` class calls the `NumberConverter.hex_to_decimal('29a77')` method. This method is designed to convert a hexadecimal number to its decimal equivalent.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown:
1. The input hexadecimal string is '29a77'.
2. The `hex_to_decimal` method uses Python's built-in `int()` function with a base of 16 to convert the hexadecimal string to a decimal integer.
3. The conversion process interprets '29a77' as a hexadecimal number and converts it to its decimal equivalent.

The hexadecimal number '29a77' is calculated in decimal as follows:
- '2' in hexadecimal is 2 * (16^4) = 2 * 65536 = 131072
- '9' in hexadecimal is 9 * (16^3) = 9 * 4096 = 36864
- 'a' in hexadecimal is 10 * (16^2) = 10 * 256 = 2560
- '7' in hexadecimal is 7 * (16^1) = 7 * 16 = 112
- '7' in hexadecimal is 7 * (16^0) = 7 * 1 = 7

Adding these values together gives:
131072 + 36864 + 2560 + 112 + 7 = 169615

Thus, the decimal equivalent of the hexadecimal '29a77' is 169615.
