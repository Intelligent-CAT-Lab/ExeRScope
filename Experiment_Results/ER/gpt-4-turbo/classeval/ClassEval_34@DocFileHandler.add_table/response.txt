<<<Analysis>>>
The `Test.test()` method performs the following operations:
1. Initializes a `DocFileHandler` instance with the file path "test_example.docx".
2. Creates a new Word document and adds a paragraph with the text "Initial content". This document is then saved to "test_example.docx".
3. Calls the `add_table` method of the `DocFileHandler` class, passing a 2D list `data` containing headers and rows. This method attempts to:
   - Open the existing document "test_example.docx".
   - Add a table with the dimensions based on the `data` list (3 rows and 2 columns).
   - Populate the table cells with the corresponding values from `data`.
   - Save the document.
4. Reopens the document "test_example.docx" and retrieves the first table.
5. Returns the number of rows and columns in the table, and the text from specific cells (cell at row 1, column 0 and cell at row 2, column 1).

Assuming all file operations and document manipulations are successful (i.e., no exceptions are thrown and the file path is correct), the table should be correctly added and populated with the data provided. The method should then correctly retrieve and return the specified values from the table.
