<<<Analysis>>>
The `Test.test()` method initializes an instance of the `BookManagement` class and then performs a series of operations on the book inventory.

1. An instance of `BookManagement` is created, initializing an empty inventory dictionary.
2. The `add_book` method is called with the title "book1" and quantity 2. Since "book1" is not in the inventory, it is added with a quantity of 2.
3. The `add_book` method is called again, this time with the title "book2" and the default quantity of 1. Since "book2" is not in the inventory, it is added with a quantity of 1.
4. The `remove_book` method is called with the title "book1" and quantity 2. Since "book1" is in the inventory and has a quantity of 2, which matches the quantity to be removed, the quantity is subtracted, resulting in a quantity of 0 for "book1". The entry for "book1" is then deleted from the inventory because its quantity reaches 0.
5. Finally, the method returns the current state of the inventory.

After these operations, the inventory contains only "book2" with a quantity of 1, as the entry for "book1" was removed completely.

<<<Output>>>
{'book2': 1}
