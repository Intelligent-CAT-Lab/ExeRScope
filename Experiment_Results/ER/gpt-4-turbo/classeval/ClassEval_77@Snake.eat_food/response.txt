<<<Analysis>>>
The `Test.test()` method initializes a `Snake` object with a screen width and height of 100 units each, a block size of 1 unit, and an initial food position at (51, 51). The snake's initial length is set to 1, and its initial score is 0.

The `eat_food()` method is called four times within the `test()` method. Each call to `eat_food()` performs the following actions:
1. Increases the snake's length by 1.
2. Increases the snake's score by 100 points.
3. Calls `random_food_position()` to generate a new food position. This method ensures that the new food position is not within the snake's current positions. Given the randomness and the lack of specific seed or control over `random.randint()`, the exact position of the food after each call is unpredictable but will be within the bounds of the screen size adjusted by the block size.

Initially:
- Length = 1
- Score = 0

After each `eat_food()` call:
1. Length = 2, Score = 100
2. Length = 3, Score = 200
3. Length = 4, Score = 300
4. Length = 5, Score = 400

Finally, the `test()` method returns the snake's length and score twice, which after four calls to `eat_food()` would be 5 and 400 respectively.

<<<Output>>>
(5, 400, 5, 400)
