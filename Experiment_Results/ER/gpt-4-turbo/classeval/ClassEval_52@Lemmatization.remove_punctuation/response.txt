<<<Analysis>>>
The `Test.test()` method in the provided code initializes an instance of the `Lemmatization` class and then calls the `remove_punctuation` method with the string "Is this a test? I hope it is...". The purpose of `remove_punctuation` is to remove all punctuation from the input sentence.

The `remove_punctuation` method uses Python's `str.translate` method combined with `str.maketrans` to create a translation table that maps all punctuation characters (as defined in `string.punctuation`) to `None`, effectively removing them from the string.

The input string "Is this a test? I hope it is..." contains punctuation characters such as question marks and periods. The method processes the string to remove these characters, resulting in the string "Is this a test I hope it is".

The `test()` method then returns a tuple containing the result of the `remove_punctuation` method and the expected string "Is this a test I hope it is".

<<<Output>>>
('Is this a test I hope it is', 'Is this a test I hope it is')
