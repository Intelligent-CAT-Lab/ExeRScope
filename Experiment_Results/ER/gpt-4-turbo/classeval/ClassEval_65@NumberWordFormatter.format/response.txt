<<<Analysis>>>
The `Test.test()` method creates an instance of `NumberWordFormatter` and calls the `format` method with the argument `1.23`.

1. The `format` method converts the number `1.23` to a string and passes it to `format_string`.
2. In `format_string`, the string "1.23" is split into `lstr` = "1" and `rstr` = "23".
3. `lstrrev` is the reverse of `lstr`, which is "1". Since its length is 1, two zeros are added to make it "100".
4. The loop processes the string in chunks of three characters. Here, `a[0]` becomes "100".
5. `trans_three("100")` is called:
   - Since the first character is "1", and the rest are "00", it returns "ONE HUNDRED".
6. `parse_more(0)` returns an empty string because it corresponds to units (less than thousand).
7. The formatted left side (`lm`) becomes "ONE HUNDRED".
8. `trans_two("23")` processes the right side:
   - Since the first digit is "2" (not "0" or "1"), and the second digit is "3", it returns "TWENTY THREE".
9. The final formatted string combines the left and right parts, resulting in "ONE HUNDRED AND CENTS TWENTY THREE ONLY".

<<<Output>>>
ONE HUNDRED AND CENTS TWENTY THREE ONLY
