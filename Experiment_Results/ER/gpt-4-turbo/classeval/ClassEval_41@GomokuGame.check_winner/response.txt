<<<Analysis>>>
The `Test.test()` method initializes an instance of `GomokuGame` with a board size of 10. The `GomokuGame` constructor sets up a 10x10 board filled with spaces (' ') and sets the current player to 'X'.

The `check_winner()` method is then called on this instance. This method checks if there is a winner by looking for five consecutive identical symbols (either 'X' or 'O') in any row, column, or diagonal.

1. The `check_winner()` method iterates over each cell in the board.
2. For each cell that is not empty (in this case, all cells are empty since no moves have been made), it checks in four directions: horizontal, vertical, diagonal down-right, and diagonal down-left.
3. The `_check_five_in_a_row()` helper method is used to check for five consecutive symbols in the specified direction starting from the current cell. It checks if the next four cells in the direction have the same symbol as the current cell and are within the board boundaries.
4. Since the board is initially empty, no cell will trigger a positive check for five consecutive symbols.

Given that no moves have been made and the board is empty, there are no five consecutive symbols in any direction. Therefore, the `check_winner()` method will return `None`.

<<<Output>>>
None
