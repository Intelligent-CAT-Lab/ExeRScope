<<<Analysis>>>
The `Test.test()` method invokes `VectorUtil.n_similarity(vector_list1, vector_list2)`. Here's the step-by-step analysis of what happens inside `n_similarity`:

1. **Input Vectors**:
   - `vector_list1` contains two vectors: `[1, 1]` and `[0, 1]`.
   - `vector_list2` contains two vectors: `[0, 0]` and `[1, 1]`.

2. **Check for Empty Lists**:
   - The method first checks if either of the input lists is empty. If either is empty, it raises a `ZeroDivisionError`. In this case, both lists are non-empty.

3. **Mean Vectors Calculation**:
   - The method calculates the mean of the vectors in each list:
     - For `vector_list1`, the mean vector is calculated as `([1, 1] + [0, 1]) / 2 = [0.5, 1]`.
     - For `vector_list2`, the mean vector is calculated as `([0, 0] + [1, 1]) / 2 = [0.5, 0.5]`.

4. **Unit Vectors**:
   - The method then converts these mean vectors into unit vectors using `matutils.unitvec`:
     - Unit vector of `[0.5, 1]` is calculated.
     - Unit vector of `[0.5, 0.5]` is calculated.

5. **Dot Product of Unit Vectors**:
   - The cosine similarity between these two unit vectors is computed using the dot product. This is the measure of cosine similarity between the average directions of the vectors in the two lists.

6. **Return Value**:
   - The computed similarity value is returned.

Given the vectors, the cosine similarity will be calculated based on the normalized mean vectors. The exact numerical value depends on the normalization and dot product calculations performed by numpy and gensim's matutils.
