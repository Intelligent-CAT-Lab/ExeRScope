<<<Analysis>>>
The `Test.test()` method creates an instance of the `AccessGatewayFilter` class and then calls the `is_start_with()` method with the `request_uri` set to '/def/data'.

The `is_start_with()` method checks if the `request_uri` starts with any of the strings in the list `start_with`, which contains the strings "/api" and "/login". The method iterates through the list and uses the `startswith()` method to check if `request_uri` starts with any of these strings.

In this case:
- '/def/data' does not start with '/api'
- '/def/data' does not start with '/login'

Since '/def/data' does not start with any of the specified strings in the list, the method returns `False`.

<<<Output>>>
False
