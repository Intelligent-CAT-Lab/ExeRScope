The `Test.test()` method creates an instance of the `SplitSentence` class and then calls the `count_words` method with the string "abc def bbb1" as an argument.

1. Inside the `count_words` method:
   - The input string "abc def bbb1" is processed to remove any non-alphabetic characters except spaces. This is done using the regular expression `re.sub(r'[^a-zA-Z\s]', '', sentence)`. The regex pattern `[^a-zA-Z\s]` matches any character that is not a letter or a space. The `re.sub` function replaces these matched characters with an empty string.
   - After substitution, the string becomes "abc def bbb".
   - Next, the cleaned string "abc def bbb" is split into words using the `split()` method, which by default splits by whitespace. This results in a list of words: `['abc', 'def', 'bbb']`.
   - The length of this list is calculated using `len(words)`, which is 3 because there are three words.

2. The `count_words` method returns the count of words, which is 3.

Therefore, the output of `Test.test()` will be 3.
