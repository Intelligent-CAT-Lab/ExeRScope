<<<Analysis>>>
The `test()` method in the `Test` class creates an instance of `MetricsCalculator` and then calls the `update()` method with two lists of predicted and true labels. The `update()` method iterates over these lists to update the counts of true positives, false positives, false negatives, and true negatives based on the conditions provided.

Here's the breakdown of the `update()` method with the provided inputs:
- predicted_labels = [1, 1, 0, 0]
- true_labels = [1, 1, 0, 1]

For the first pair (1, 1):
- Both predicted and true are 1, so `true_positives` is incremented by 1.

For the second pair (1, 1):
- Both predicted and true are 1 again, so `true_positives` is incremented by 1 again.

For the third pair (0, 0):
- Both predicted and true are 0, so `true_negatives` is incremented by 1.

For the fourth pair (0, 1):
- Predicted is 0 and true is 1, so `false_negatives` is incremented by 1.

After processing all pairs, the counts are:
- true_positives = 2
- false_positives = 0
- false_negatives = 1
- true_negatives = 1

The `test()` method does not return any value explicitly, so the return value of `Test.test()` is `None`.
