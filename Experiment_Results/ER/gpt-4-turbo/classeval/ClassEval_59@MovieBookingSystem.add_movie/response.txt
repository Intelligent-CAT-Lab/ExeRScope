<<<Analysis>>>
The `test()` method in the `Test` class performs the following operations:
1. An instance of `MovieBookingSystem` is created.
2. A movie named 'Batman' with a price of 29.9, starting at '17:05' and ending at '19:25', with a 3x3 seating arrangement (n=3) is added to the system using the `add_movie()` method.
3. The `add_movie()` method constructs a dictionary for the movie with the specified attributes. The start and end times are converted from string format to `datetime` objects. The seating arrangement is initialized as a 3x3 numpy array filled with zeros.
4. The method then returns a tuple containing:
   - The length of the `movies` list in the system, which should be 1 since one movie was added.
   - The name of the first movie in the list, which is 'Batman'.
   - The price of the first movie, which is 29.9.
   - The start time of the first movie as a `datetime` object, which should match the `datetime` object created from the string '17:05'.
   - The `datetime` object created directly from the string '17:05' for comparison.
   - The end time of the first movie as a `datetime` object, which should match the `datetime` object created from the string '19:25'.
   - The `datetime` object created directly from the string '19:25' for comparison.
   - The shape of the numpy array representing the seats, which should be (3, 3).

<<<Output>>>
(1, 'Batman', 29.9, datetime.datetime(1900, 1, 1, 17, 5), datetime.datetime(1900, 1, 1, 17, 5), datetime.datetime(1900, 1, 1, 19, 25), datetime.datetime(1900, 1, 1, 19, 25), (3, 3))
