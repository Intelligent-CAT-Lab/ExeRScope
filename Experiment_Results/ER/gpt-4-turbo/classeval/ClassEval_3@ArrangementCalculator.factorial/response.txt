In the test() method, the ArrangementCalculator.factorial(4) method is called. This method calculates the factorial of the number provided, which in this case is 4.
The factorial() method initializes a variable `result` to 1. It then uses a for loop to iterate from 2 up to and including n (4 in this case), multiplying `result` by each integer in that range.
Here's the step-by-step calculation:
- Initially: result = 1
- First iteration: i=2, result = 1 * 2 = 2
- Second iteration: i=3, result = 2 * 3 = 6
- Third iteration: i=4, result = 6 * 4 = 24
After completing the loop, the method returns the value of `result`, which is 24.

<<<Output>>>
24
