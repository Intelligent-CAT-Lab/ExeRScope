<<<Analysis>>>
The `Test.test()` method creates an instance of the `CamelCaseMap` class and then calls the `_convert_key` method with the argument 'first_name'. The `_convert_key` method checks if the key is a string, which it is, and then calls the `_to_camel_case` method to convert the key from snake_case to camelCase.

The `_to_camel_case` method works as follows:
1. It splits the input string 'first_name' into parts using underscore as the delimiter, resulting in the list `['first', 'name']`.
2. It keeps the first part 'first' as is, and capitalizes the first letter of each subsequent part. In this case, 'name' becomes 'Name'.
3. It then joins these parts together, resulting in 'firstName'.

Thus, the output of the `_convert_key` method for the input 'first_name' is 'firstName'.
<<<Output>>>
'firstName'
