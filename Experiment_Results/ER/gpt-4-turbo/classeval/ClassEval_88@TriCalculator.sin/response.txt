<<<Analysis>>>
The `Test.test()` method creates an instance of the `TriCalculator` class and then calls the `sin` method with an argument of 0.

The `sin` method first converts the input angle from degrees to radians. Since the input is 0, the conversion results in 0 radians (0 / 180 * pi = 0).

The method initializes `g` to 0, `t` to the radian value (which is 0), and `n` to 1. The while loop condition checks if the absolute value of `t` is greater than or equal to 1e-15. Since `t` is 0 from the start, the condition fails immediately, and the loop does not execute.

As a result, the method returns the value of `g`, which remains 0, rounded to 10 decimal places.
