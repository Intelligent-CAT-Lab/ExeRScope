<<<Analysis>>>
The `Test.test()` method initializes an instance of `AccessGatewayFilter` and then creates a `request` dictionary with specific headers. The headers include an 'Authorization' key, which itself is a dictionary containing a 'user' dictionary and a 'jwt' string. The 'jwt' string is constructed by concatenating the user's name ('user1') with a date string that represents the date five days before the current date.

The `get_jwt_user()` method of `AccessGatewayFilter` is then called with this `request` dictionary. Inside `get_jwt_user()`, the method attempts to extract the 'Authorization' token from the request headers and then the 'user' from the token.

The method checks if the 'jwt' string starts with the user's name ('user1'). If true, it then extracts the date part of the 'jwt' string by splitting it using the user's name. This extracted date string is then converted into a `datetime` object.

The method then checks if the difference between today's date and the extracted date is greater than or equal to 3 days. In this case, since the 'jwt' was constructed with a date 5 days before today, the condition is true. Therefore, the method should return `None` because the token is considered expired.
