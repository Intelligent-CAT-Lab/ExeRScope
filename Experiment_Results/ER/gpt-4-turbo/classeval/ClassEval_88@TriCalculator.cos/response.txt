The `Test.test()` method creates an instance of the `TriCalculator` class and then calls the `cos` method with the argument 0. The `cos` method internally uses the `taylor` method to compute the cosine using the Taylor series expansion.

1. The `cos` method is called with x = 0 and internally calls `taylor(x, 50)`.
2. In the `taylor` method:
   - x is converted from degrees to radians. Since x = 0, x in radians is also 0.
   - The variable `a` is initialized to 1.
   - A loop runs from k = 1 to 49 (since n = 50). In each iteration:
     - The Taylor series alternates between subtraction and addition of terms.
     - Since x = 0, all terms `(x ** (2 * k))` become 0.
     - Therefore, the factorial calculations do not affect the result because any number times 0 is 0.
   - The loop effectively does nothing to change `a` from its initial value of 1.
3. The `taylor` method returns 1.
4. The `cos` method rounds this result to 10 decimal places, which remains 1.

Thus, the output of `tricalculator.cos(0)` is 1.0.
