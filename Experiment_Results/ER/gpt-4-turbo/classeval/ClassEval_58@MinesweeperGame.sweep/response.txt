<<<Analysis>>>
In the `Test.test()` method, an instance of `MinesweeperGame` is created with a grid size of 3x3 and 1 mine. The `minesweeper_map` and `player_map` are manually set to predefined values for testing purposes. The `minesweeper_map` has a mine ('X') at position (0,0) and numbers indicating the count of adjacent mines in other cells. The `player_map` is initialized with all cells covered ('-').

The `sweep` method is then called with coordinates (0, 0). This method checks the `minesweeper_map` at the given coordinates:
1. If there is a mine ('X') at the coordinates, the method returns `False` immediately.
2. If there is no mine, it reveals the cell on the `player_map` and increments the score by 1. It then checks if the game is won by calling `check_won`, which verifies if all non-mine cells are revealed.

In this specific test case, since the `sweep` method is called on a cell containing a mine (0,0), the method will return `False` immediately. The score, which starts at 0, will not be incremented because the game ends as soon as a mine is revealed.

Thus, the output of the `test()` method will be the tuple `(False, 0)`, indicating that the sweep was unsuccessful (hit a mine) and the score remains 0.

(False, 0)
