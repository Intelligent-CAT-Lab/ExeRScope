<<<Analysis>>>
The `Test.test()` method in the provided code initializes an instance of the `Calculator` class and then calls the `precedence` method twice, once with the operator '+' and once with the operator '-'. 

The `precedence` method in the `Calculator` class is designed to return the precedence level of arithmetic operators. According to the method's implementation:
- '+' and '-' have a precedence of 1.
- '*' and '/' have a precedence of 2.
- '^' has a precedence of 3.

When `calculator.precedence('+')` is called, it looks up the precedence dictionary and finds that '+' has a precedence of 1. Similarly, `calculator.precedence('-')` also returns a precedence of 1 because '-' is also defined with a precedence of 1 in the dictionary.

Thus, the method `test()` will return the tuple (1, 1) as the result of these two calls.

<<<Output>>>
(1, 1)
