The `test()` method in the `Test` class calls the `octal_to_decimal()` static method of the `NumberConverter` class with the octal string '51427' as an argument. The purpose of this method is to convert an octal number (base 8) to a decimal number (base 10).

Here's how the `octal_to_decimal()` method works:
1. The method receives the octal string '51427'.
2. It uses Python's built-in `int()` function with a base of 8 to convert the octal string to a decimal integer.
3. The `int()` function interprets the string '51427' as an octal number and converts it to its decimal equivalent.

To manually calculate the decimal equivalent of the octal number 51427:
- 7 (units place) * 8^0 = 7
- 2 (tens place) * 8^1 = 16
- 4 (hundreds place) * 8^2 = 256
- 1 (thousands place) * 8^3 = 512
- 5 (ten-thousands place) * 8^4 = 20480
Adding these values together gives: 7 + 16 + 256 + 512 + 20480 = 21271

Thus, the decimal equivalent of the octal number '51427' is 21271.
