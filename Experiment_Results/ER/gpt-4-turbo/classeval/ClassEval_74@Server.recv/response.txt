<<<Analysis>>>
In the `test()` method of the `Test` class, an instance of the `Server` class is created named `server`. The `recv()` method of the `Server` class is then called with the dictionary `{"content": "abc"}` as an argument.

The `recv()` method first checks if the input `info` is a dictionary and contains both "addr" and "content" keys. In this case, the input dictionary does not contain the "addr" key, so the method immediately returns `-1`.

Since the `recv()` method returns `-1`, the `receive_struct` attribute of the `server` instance remains unchanged from its initial state, which is an empty dictionary `{}`.

Therefore, the `test()` method returns a tuple containing the `receive_struct` (which is `{}`) and the flag (which is `-1`).
