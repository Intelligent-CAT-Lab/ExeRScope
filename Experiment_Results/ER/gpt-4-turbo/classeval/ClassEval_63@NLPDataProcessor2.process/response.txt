In the `test()` method of the `Test` class, an instance of `NLPDataProcessor2` is created. The method then defines an empty list `string_list` and another empty list `expected_output`. The `process_data()` method of `NLPDataProcessor2` is called with `string_list` as its argument.

The `process_data()` method is designed to process a list of strings by removing non-English letters, converting the text to lowercase, and splitting the strings into words. Here's the step-by-step breakdown for the `process_data()` method when given an empty list:
1. An empty list `words_list` is initialized.
2. The method iterates over each string in the input `string_list`. Since `string_list` is empty, the loop does not execute.
3. The method returns the empty `words_list`.

Since `string_list` is empty, the `process_data()` method returns an empty list. The `test()` method then returns a tuple containing this empty list and `expected_output`, which is also an empty list.
