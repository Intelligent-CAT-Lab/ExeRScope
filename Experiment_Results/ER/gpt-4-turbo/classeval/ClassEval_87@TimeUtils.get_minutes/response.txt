<<<Analysis>>>
The `Test.test()` method creates an instance of the `TimeUtils` class and then calls the `get_minutes` method with two specific datetime strings: '2001-7-18 1:1:1' and '2001-7-18 5:1:1'.

1. Inside the `get_minutes` method, the `string_to_datetime` method is called twice to convert the input strings to datetime objects. The format used for parsing is "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S".
   - For '2001-7-18 1:1:1', it converts to July 18, 2001, at 01:01:01.
   - For '2001-7-18 5:1:1', it converts to July 18, 2001, at 05:01:01.

2. The difference between the two datetime objects (`time2 - time1`) is calculated. The difference is 4 hours, which is equivalent to 14400 seconds.

3. The method then calculates the number of minutes from the seconds difference by dividing by 60. The result is 240 minutes.

4. The result is rounded using the `round` function, though in this case, it remains 240 as it's already an integer.

Thus, the method returns 240, representing the number of minutes between 1:01:01 and 5:01:01 on the same day.

<<<Output>>>
240
