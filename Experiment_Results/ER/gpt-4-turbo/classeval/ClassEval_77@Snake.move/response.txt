<<<Analysis>>>
The `Test.test()` method initializes a `Snake` object with the following parameters:
- SCREEN_WIDTH = 100
- SCREEN_HEIGHT = 100
- BLOCK_SIZE = 1
- food_position = (51, 51)

The initial position of the snake is calculated as the center of the screen, which is (SCREEN_WIDTH / 2, SCREEN_HEIGHT / 2) = (50, 50). The snake's length is initialized to 1, and its score is 0.

The `move()` method is then called with the direction (0, 0), which means there is no change in the x or y coordinates. The new position of the snake is calculated as:
- new x = (50 + (0 * 1)) % 100 = 50
- new y = (50 + (0 * 1)) % 100 = 50

Since the new position (50, 50) does not match the food position (51, 51), the snake does not eat the food. The snake's length remains 1, and its score remains 0. The positions list is updated to have the new position at the beginning, but since the length is 1, it remains with the single position (50, 50).

Finally, the `test()` method returns the snake's length, the first position in the positions list, and the score, which are 1, (50, 50), and 0 respectively.

<<<Output>>>
(1, (50, 50), 0)
