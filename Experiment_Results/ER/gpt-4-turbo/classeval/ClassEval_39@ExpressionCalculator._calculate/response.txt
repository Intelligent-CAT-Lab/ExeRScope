<<<Analysis>>>
The `Test.test()` method initializes an instance of the `ExpressionCalculator` class and then directly calls the `_calculate` method of this instance with the arguments "2", "3", and "*". The `_calculate` method is designed to perform arithmetic operations based on the operator provided. In this case, the operator is "*", which denotes multiplication.

The `_calculate` method converts the string arguments "2" and "3" into `Decimal` objects and then performs the multiplication operation. The `Decimal` class is used for decimal floating point arithmetic, and it helps in maintaining precision for operations involving decimals.

Here's the breakdown of the `_calculate` method when called with "2", "3", and "*":
1. Convert "2" to a `Decimal` object.
2. Convert "3" to a `Decimal` object.
3. Multiply these two `Decimal` objects.
4. The result of `Decimal('2') * Decimal('3')` is `Decimal('6')`.

The method then returns this result. The test method returns a tuple containing this result and `Decimal(6.0)`. However, `Decimal(6.0)` is not the same as `Decimal('6')` due to the way floating-point numbers are handled, but in this context, they represent the same value.

<<<Output>>>
(Decimal('6'), Decimal('6.0'))
