<<<Analysis>>>
The `Test.test()` method creates an instance of the `TriCalculator` class and calls the `taylor` method with arguments 90 and 50. The `taylor` method is designed to approximate the cosine of an angle using the Taylor series expansion.

1. The angle `x` is converted from degrees to radians by multiplying it by `pi/180`. For `x = 90`, this results in `pi/2`.
2. The variable `a` is initialized to 1, and `count` is initialized to 1.
3. A loop runs from `k = 1` to `k = 49` (since `n = 50`).
4. Inside the loop, depending on whether `count` is odd or even, the series alternates between subtracting and adding terms of the form `(x ** (2 * k)) / self.factorial(2 * k)`.
5. The factorial of `2 * k` is calculated using the `factorial` method, which iteratively multiplies numbers down from `2 * k` to 1.
6. The power `x ** (2 * k)` is computed for each `k`.
7. These terms are added or subtracted from `a` based on the parity of `count`.
8. After completing the loop, the method returns the value of `a`.

Given that the Taylor series for cosine converges to the actual cosine value, and since the cosine of `pi/2` (or 90 degrees) is 0, the expected result of the series should be close to 0, especially with 50 terms in the series.
