<<<Analysis>>>
The `Test.test()` method performs the following operations:
1. Initializes a new instance of `MovieTicketDB` with the database name 'test_database.db'. This triggers the `__init__` method in `MovieTicketDB`, which connects to the SQLite database and calls `create_table()` to ensure the 'tickets' table exists.
2. Inserts a ticket into the database using `insert_ticket()` method with the details for the movie 'Avengers: Endgame', theater 'Cinema 1', seat 'A1', and customer 'bbb'.
3. Searches for tickets by the customer name 'bbb' using `search_tickets_by_customer()`. This method queries the database for tickets where the customer name matches 'bbb'.
4. Fetches the results using `fetchall()`, which returns a list of tuples representing the rows in the database that match the query. Each tuple contains the ticket details.
5. The method then selects the first ticket from the list (since only one ticket was inserted) and returns the length of the tickets list and the details of the first ticket (excluding the ticket id).

The expected output will be the details of the inserted ticket, which includes the length of the list (1, since only one ticket was inserted), and the details of the ticket: movie name, theater name, seat number, and customer name.

<<<Output>>>
(1, 'Avengers: Endgame', 'Cinema 1', 'A1', 'bbb')
