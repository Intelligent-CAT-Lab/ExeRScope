<<<Analysis>>>
The `Test.test()` method performs several operations on a SQLite database related to user management:
1. A temporary database file `test_db.db` is created.
2. A connection to this database is established, and a cursor is obtained.
3. A table named `users` is created in the database if it does not already exist. This table has two columns: `username` and `password`.
4. The connection is committed and closed.
5. A new connection to the same database is established through the `UserLoginDB` class.
6. A user with username 'user2' and password 'pass2' is inserted into the `users` table.
7. The user with username 'user2' is then deleted from the `users` table.
8. The method `search_user_by_username('user2')` is called to find the user with username 'user2'.
9. Since the user was deleted in the previous step, the search should return `None` because there is no such user in the database anymore.

The final operation is to return the result of the search, which should be `None` since the user was deleted.
