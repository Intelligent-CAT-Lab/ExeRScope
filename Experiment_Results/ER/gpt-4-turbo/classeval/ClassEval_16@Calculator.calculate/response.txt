The `Test.test()` method creates an instance of the `Calculator` class and then calls the `calculate` method with the expression '1+2*3'.

1. The `calculate` method initializes empty stacks for operands and operators, and an empty string `num_buffer` for accumulating number characters.
2. It iterates over each character in the expression '1+2*3':
   - For '1', it adds '1' to `num_buffer`.
   - For '+', it pushes the number 1.0 (converted from `num_buffer`) to `operand_stack` and clears `num_buffer`. It then pushes '+' to `operator_stack`.
   - For '2', it adds '2' to `num_buffer`.
   - For '*', it pushes the number 2.0 to `operand_stack` and clears `num_buffer`. Since '*' has higher precedence than '+', it simply pushes '*' to `operator_stack`.
   - For '3', it adds '3' to `num_buffer`.
3. After the loop, it pushes the number 3.0 to `operand_stack`.
4. The expression has been fully parsed, so the method processes the remaining operators in `operator_stack`:
   - It applies '*' first, popping 3.0 and 2.0 from `operand_stack`, calculates 2.0 * 3.0 = 6.0, and pushes the result back to `operand_stack`.
   - It then applies '+', popping 6.0 and 1.0 from `operand_stack`, calculates 1.0 + 6.0 = 7.0, and pushes the result back to `operand_stack`.
5. The final result is 7.0, which is the only value in `operand_stack`.

<<<Output>>>
7.0
