<<<Analysis>>>
In the test() method, an instance of CurrencyConverter is created, and the convert method is called with parameters 64, '???', and 'USD'. The convert method first checks if the from_currency is the same as to_currency, which it is not in this case. Then, it checks if both the from_currency and to_currency are present in the rates dictionary. The from_currency '???' is not a valid key in the rates dictionary, which includes only 'USD', 'EUR', 'GBP', 'JPY', 'CAD', 'AUD', and 'CNY'. Since '???' is not found in the rates dictionary, the method returns False.
<<<Output>>>
False
