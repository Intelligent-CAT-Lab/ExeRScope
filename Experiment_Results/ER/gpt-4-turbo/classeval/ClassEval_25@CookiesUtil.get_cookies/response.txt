<<<Analysis>>>
In the `test()` method of the `Test` class, an instance of `CookiesUtil` is created with the filename 'cookies.json'. This instance is stored in `self.cookies_util`.

Next, a dictionary named `self.response` is defined, containing multiple key-value pairs, where one of the keys is 'cookies'. This 'cookies' key points to another dictionary with keys 'key1' and 'key2' having values 'value1' and 'value2', respectively.

The `get_cookies()` method of the `CookiesUtil` class is then called with `self.response` as the argument. Inside `get_cookies()`, the method accesses `reponse['cookies']` which retrieves the dictionary `{'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2'}`. This dictionary is then assigned to the instance variable `self.cookies`.

The `_save_cookies()` method is called within `get_cookies()`. This method attempts to save the cookies dictionary to a file named 'cookies.json'. The success or failure of this operation does not affect the output of `test()` directly, as the return value of `_save_cookies()` is not used in `get_cookies()`.

Finally, `test()` returns the value of `self.cookies_util.cookies`, which is the dictionary `{'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2'}` that was retrieved from the response and saved to the instance variable.

<<<Output>>>
{'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2'}
