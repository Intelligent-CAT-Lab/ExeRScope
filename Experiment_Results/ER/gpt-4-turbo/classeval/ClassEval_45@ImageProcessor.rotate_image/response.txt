<<<Analysis>>>
In the `test()` method of the `Test` class, the following steps are executed:

1. An instance of `ImageProcessor` is created.
2. A new image file "test.png" is created with dimensions 100x100 pixels and a white background (RGB values of 255, 255, 255).
3. This image is saved to the path specified by `self.image_path`.
4. The `load_image()` method of `ImageProcessor` is called with `self.image_path`, loading the image into the `self.image` attribute of the `ImageProcessor` instance.
5. The original image loaded into `self.processor.image` is stored in `original_image`.
6. The `rotate_image()` method is called with a rotation of 360 degrees. Rotating an image by 360 degrees results in an image that is visually identical to the original image.
7. The `ImageChops.difference()` function is used to compare the difference between the original image rotated by 360 degrees and the image stored in `self.processor.image` after the rotation. Since both operations (the manual rotation in `original_image.rotate(360)` and the rotation in `self.processor.rotate_image(360)`) result in the same transformation, there should be no difference between the two images.
8. `ImageChops.difference().getbbox()` returns `None` if there is no difference between the two images, which means the images are identical.

Based on these steps, the expected result of the comparison is that there is no difference between the original image and the processed image, hence the return value should be `True`.
