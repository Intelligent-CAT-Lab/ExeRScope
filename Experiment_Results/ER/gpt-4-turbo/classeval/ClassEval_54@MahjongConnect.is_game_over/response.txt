<<<Analysis>>>
In the `test()` method of the `Test` class, an instance of `MahjongConnect` is created with a board size of 4x4 and icons 'a', 'b', 'c'. The board is then manually set to a specific configuration where most of the tiles are empty (' '), except for one tile at position (1, 0) which contains the icon 'a'.

The `is_game_over()` method of the `MahjongConnect` class is called to determine if the game is over. This method checks if all icons on the board have been removed (i.e., all positions are ' '). It iterates through each row of the board and checks if there is any icon that is not ' ' (empty). If it finds any non-empty icon, it returns `False`, indicating the game is not over. If it completes the iteration without finding any non-empty icons, it returns `True`, indicating the game is over.

In the provided board setup:
- The first row is entirely empty.
- The second row has one icon 'a' at position (1, 0) and the rest are empty.
- The third and fourth rows are entirely empty.

Since there is at least one non-empty position (with 'a'), the `is_game_over()` method will return `False`.
