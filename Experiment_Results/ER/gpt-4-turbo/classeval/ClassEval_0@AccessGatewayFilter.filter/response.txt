<<<Analysis>>>
The `Test.test()` method creates an instance of `AccessGatewayFilter` and then calls the `filter` method with a specific request dictionary. The request dictionary has a path '/abc', method 'POST', and headers containing an 'Authorization' dictionary with user details and a JWT token.

1. The `filter` method first checks if the request URI starts with "/api" or "/login" using the `is_start_with` method. Since '/abc' does not start with these prefixes, the method returns False.

2. The method then proceeds to extract the JWT token using `get_jwt_user`. It retrieves the token from the request headers and checks if the JWT starts with the user's name followed by the current date in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD'. Since the JWT is constructed correctly in the test case, it returns the token dictionary.

3. Back in the `filter` method, it checks if the user's level is greater than 2. The user level in the test case is 5, which is greater than 2.

4. The method then calls `set_current_user_info_and_log` to log the user's information. This method logs the user's name, address, and the current datetime.

5. Since all conditions are met and no exceptions are thrown, the `filter` method returns True.
