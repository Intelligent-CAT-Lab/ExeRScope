The `test()` method in the `Test` class creates an instance of `DataStatistics` and then calls the `median()` method with the list `[2, 5, 1, 3, 4]` as an argument.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown of the `median()` method:
1. The input data `[2, 5, 1, 3, 4]` is sorted, resulting in the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
2. The length `n` of the sorted list is calculated, which is 5.
3. Since `n` is odd (5 % 2 != 0), the method calculates the middle index as `n // 2`, which is `5 // 2 = 2`.
4. The method then returns the value at the middle index of the sorted list, which is `sorted_data[2]`. The value at index 2 in `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` is `3`.

Thus, the median of the list `[2, 5, 1, 3, 4]` is `3`.
