<<<Analysis>>>
The `test()` method in the `Test` class performs several operations:
1. It initializes a list of file names (`self.files`) and a list of contents (`self.contents`) corresponding to each file.
2. It iterates over these lists and writes each content to its corresponding file. This setup ensures that each file contains the specified content.
3. An instance of `TextFileProcessor` is created with the path to the first file (`'test_1.txt'`).
4. The `read_file_as_json()` method of `TextFileProcessor` is called, which reads the content of `'test_1.txt'` and attempts to parse it as JSON.
5. The content of `'test_1.txt'` is a JSON string representing an object with properties "name" and "age".
6. The method `read_file_as_json()` should successfully parse this JSON string and return a Python dictionary equivalent to the JSON object.
7. The expected output is defined as `{"name": "test", "age": 12}`.
8. The method returns a tuple containing the type of the data returned by `read_file_as_json()`, which should be `<class 'dict'>`, and the data itself, which should match the expected dictionary.

<<<Output>>>
(<class 'dict'>, {'name': 'test', 'age': 12})
