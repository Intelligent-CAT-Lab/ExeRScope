<<<Analysis>>>
The `Test.test()` method creates an instance of the `IPAddress` class with the IP address "10.10.10.10". It then calls the `get_octets()` method on this instance.

1. The `get_octets()` method first calls the `is_valid()` method to check if the IP address is valid.
2. Inside `is_valid()`, the IP address "10.10.10.10" is split into octets resulting in the list `['10', '10', '10', '10']`.
3. It checks if the number of octets is exactly 4, which is true in this case.
4. It then checks each octet to ensure they are all digits and within the range of 0 to 255. All octets '10' meet these conditions.
5. Since all conditions are met, `is_valid()` returns `True`.
6. Returning to `get_octets()`, since the IP address is valid, it returns the list of octets `['10', '10', '10', '10']`.

<<<Output>>>
['10', '10', '10', '10']
