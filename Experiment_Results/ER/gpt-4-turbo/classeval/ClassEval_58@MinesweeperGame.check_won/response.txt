<<<Analysis>>>
The `Test.test()` method initializes a `MinesweeperGame` object with a 3x3 grid and 1 mine. The `minesweeper_map` and `player_map` are manually set to predefined values for the purpose of the test.

The `minesweeper_map` is:
[['X', 1, 0],
 [1, 1, 0],
 [0, 0, 0]]

The `player_map` is:
[['-', '-', '-'],
 ['-', 1, '-'],
 ['-', '-', '-']]

The `check_won()` method of the `MinesweeperGame` class is called with the `player_map`. This method checks if all non-mine cells ('-') in the `player_map` are revealed. If any non-mine cell is still hidden ('-'), the method returns `False`, indicating the game is not yet won.

In the `player_map`, there are several cells with '-' that correspond to non-mine cells in the `minesweeper_map`. Specifically, the cells at positions (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), and (2,2) are not revealed and do not contain mines. Since these cells are still hidden, the game is not won.

Therefore, the `check_won()` method will return `False`.

<<<Output>>>
False
