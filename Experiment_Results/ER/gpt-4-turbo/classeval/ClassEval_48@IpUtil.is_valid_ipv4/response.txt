<<<Analysis>>>
The `test()` method in the `Test` class calls the `is_valid_ipv4()` method of the `IpUtil` class with the IP address '10.10.10.10' as an argument. The purpose of `is_valid_ipv4()` is to check if the given string is a valid IPv4 address.

Here's how `is_valid_ipv4()` works:
1. It uses the `socket.inet_pton()` function with `socket.AF_INET` to attempt parsing the IP address as an IPv4 address.
2. If `socket.inet_pton()` does not raise an exception (`socket.error`), it means the IP address is a valid IPv4 address, and the method returns `True`.
3. If a `socket.error` is raised, it indicates that the IP address is not a valid IPv4 address, and the method returns `False`.

For the IP address '10.10.10.10':
- This is a standard format for an IPv4 address, consisting of four octets separated by dots, with each octet being a decimal number from 0 to 255.
- The address '10.10.10.10' adheres to this format and falls within the valid range for each octet.
- Therefore, `socket.inet_pton()` should successfully parse this address without raising an exception.

Based on this analysis, the method `is_valid_ipv4('10.10.10.10')` should return `True`.
