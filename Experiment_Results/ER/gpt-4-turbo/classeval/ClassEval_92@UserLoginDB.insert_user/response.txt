The `Test.test()` method performs several operations involving a SQLite database to test the functionality of the `UserLoginDB` class. Here's a breakdown of the steps:

1. A temporary database file `test_db.db` is created in the system's temporary directory.
2. A connection to this database is established, and a cursor is obtained for executing SQL commands.
3. A SQL command to create a table named `users` with columns `username` and `password` is executed. This table is created if it does not already exist.
4. The connection is committed to save the changes and then closed.
5. A new instance of `UserLoginDB` is created with the path to the temporary database. This instance connects to the database and prepares to execute further operations.
6. The `insert_user` method of the `UserLoginDB` instance is called with parameters 'user5' and 'pass5', inserting these values into the `users` table.
7. The `search_user_by_username` method is called with the parameter 'user5' to retrieve the user details from the database.
8. The method fetches the user details, which should be a tuple containing ('user5', 'pass5') since these were the values inserted in step 6.
9. The method returns a tuple containing the user tuple and the individual elements of the tuple, i.e., 'user5' and 'pass5'.

The expected output is a tuple where the first element is another tuple containing the username and password, and the subsequent elements are the username and password extracted from the first tuple.

<<<Output>>>
(('user5', 'pass5'), 'user5', 'pass5')
