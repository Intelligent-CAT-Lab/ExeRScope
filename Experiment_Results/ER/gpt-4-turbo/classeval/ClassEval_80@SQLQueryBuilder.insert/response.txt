<<<Analysis>>>
The `test()` method in the `Test` class calls the `insert` method of the `SQLQueryBuilder` class with parameters 'students' as the table name and a dictionary `{'name': 'Tom', 'age': 18}` representing the data to be inserted.

Inside the `insert` method:
1. The `keys` variable is created by joining the keys of the data dictionary with a comma, resulting in the string "name, age".
2. The `values` variable is created by joining the values of the data dictionary, each enclosed in single quotes, with a comma. This results in the string "'Tom', '18'".
3. The method then constructs an SQL insert statement using the table name, keys, and values. The resulting SQL statement is "INSERT INTO students (name, age) VALUES ('Tom', '18')".

The method returns this SQL statement.

<<<Output>>>
"INSERT INTO students (name, age) VALUES ('Tom', '18')"
