<<<Analysis>>>
The `Test.test()` method involves the following steps:
1. An instance of `CamelCaseMap` is created.
2. The `__setitem__` method is called with the key 'first_name' and value 'John'. This method internally calls `_convert_key` to convert the key to camel case.
   - `_convert_key` checks if the key is a string and then calls `_to_camel_case`.
   - `_to_camel_case` splits 'first_name' into ['first', 'name'] and converts it to 'firstName'.
   - The key 'firstName' is then used to store the value 'John' in the `_data` dictionary.
3. The `__delitem__` method is called with the key 'firstName'.
   - `_convert_key` is called again, which directly returns 'firstName' since it's already in camel case.
   - The key 'firstName' is found in the `_data` dictionary and the corresponding item is deleted.
4. The `test` method does not return any value explicitly, so it returns `None` by default.
