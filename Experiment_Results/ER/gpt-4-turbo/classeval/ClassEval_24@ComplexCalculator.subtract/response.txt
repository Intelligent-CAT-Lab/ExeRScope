<<<Analysis>>>
The `Test.test()` method creates an instance of `ComplexCalculator` and then calls the `subtract` method with two complex numbers: `1 + 2j` and `3 + 4j`.

The `subtract` method calculates the subtraction of two complex numbers as follows:
1. It calculates the real part of the result by subtracting the real part of the second complex number from the real part of the first complex number: `1 - 3 = -2`.
2. It calculates the imaginary part of the result by subtracting the imaginary part of the second complex number from the imaginary part of the first complex number: `2 - 4 = -2`.
3. It then returns a new complex number formed by combining these calculated real and imaginary parts: `-2 - 2j`.

Thus, the result of the subtraction is the complex number `-2 - 2j`.

<<<Output>>>
(-2-2j)
