<<<Analysis>>>
The `test()` method in the `Test` class creates an instance of `MetricsCalculator` and then calls the `accuracy` method with two lists of predicted and true labels.

1. The `accuracy` method first calls the `update` method with the same lists.
2. In the `update` method:
   - It iterates over the zipped lists of predicted and true labels.
   - For the first pair (1, 1), both predicted and true are 1, so `true_positives` is incremented by 1.
   - For the second pair (1, 0), predicted is 1 and true is 0, so `false_positives` is incremented by 1.
   - For the third pair (0, 0), both predicted and true are 0, so `true_negatives` is incremented by 1.
   - For the fourth pair (1, 1), both predicted and true are 1 again, so `true_positives` is incremented by 1 again.
3. After updating the counts:
   - `true_positives` = 2
   - `false_positives` = 1
   - `false_negatives` = 0
   - `true_negatives` = 1
4. The `accuracy` method then calculates the total number of cases, which is 4 (sum of all positives and negatives).
5. The accuracy is calculated as `(true_positives + true_negatives) / total`, which is `(2 + 1) / 4 = 0.75`.

Thus, the accuracy of the predictions given the true labels is 0.75.
