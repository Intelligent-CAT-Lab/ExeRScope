<<<Analysis>>>
In the `Test.test()` method, an instance of `TimeUtils` is created. This instance initializes its `datetime` attribute to the current date and time at the moment of its creation.

The `add_seconds(300)` method of the `TimeUtils` class is called with `300` as an argument. This method adds 300 seconds (or 5 minutes) to the `datetime` attribute of the `TimeUtils` instance. It then formats this new datetime object into a string using the format "%H:%M:%S" and returns this string.

Simultaneously, the method calculates the new datetime by adding 300 seconds to the `datetime` attribute directly in the test method itself and formats it using the same format string '%H:%M:%S'.

Since both operations (inside the `add_seconds` method and directly in the test method) add the same amount of time (300 seconds) to the same initial datetime and format it in the same way, the outputs from both should be identical.

<<<Output>>>
("HH:MM:SS", "HH:MM:SS")  # where "HH:MM:SS" represents the formatted time after adding 300 seconds to the initial time captured at the creation of the TimeUtils instance.
