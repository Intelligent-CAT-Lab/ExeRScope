<<<Analysis>>>
The `Test.test()` method initializes an instance of `ExpressionCalculator` and then calls the `calculate` method with the expression "2 * 3 * 4".

1. **Transforming the Expression**:
   - The `transform` method is called with "2 * 3 * 4".
   - It removes spaces and checks for unary minus signs, but since there are none, the expression remains "2*3*4".

2. **Preparing the Expression**:
   - The `prepare` method converts the infix expression "2*3*4" to postfix notation using a stack.
   - The expression is processed character by character:
     - '2' is added directly to `postfix_stack`.
     - '*' is pushed to `op_stack`.
     - '3' is added directly to `postfix_stack`.
     - Another '*' causes the first '*' to be popped to `postfix_stack` and the new '*' is pushed to `op_stack`.
     - '4' is added directly to `postfix_stack`.
   - After processing all characters, the remaining operators in `op_stack` are moved to `postfix_stack`.
   - The final `postfix_stack` is ['2', '3', '*', '4', '*'].

3. **Calculating the Result**:
   - The `calculate` method processes the postfix expression using a `result_stack`.
   - It pops elements from `postfix_stack` and performs operations based on whether the element is an operator or an operand.
   - For '2' and '3', they are pushed to `result_stack`.
   - The '*' operator pops '3' and '2', multiplies them to get '6', and pushes '6' back to `result_stack`.
   - '4' is pushed to `result_stack`.
   - The next '*' pops '4' and '6', multiplies them to get '24', and pushes '24' back to `result_stack`.
   - The final result in `result_stack` is ['24'].

4. **Returning the Result**:
   - The final result '24' is converted to float and returned.
