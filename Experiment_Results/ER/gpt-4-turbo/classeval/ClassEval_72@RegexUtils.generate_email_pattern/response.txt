<<<Analysis>>>
The `Test.test()` method initializes an instance of the `RegexUtils` class and then calls the `generate_email_pattern()` method to get a regular expression pattern for validating email addresses. The pattern generated is `r'\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\b'`, which matches typical email formats.

Next, the `match()` method of the `RegexUtils` class is used with the generated pattern and the string 'iustd87t2euh@163.com'. The `match()` method internally uses Python's `re.match()` function, which checks if the beginning of the string conforms to the pattern.

The email 'iustd87t2euh@163.com' correctly matches the pattern from the start of the string:
- It starts with a word boundary (`\b`).
- Followed by one or more alphanumeric characters, dots, underscores, percent signs, plus signs, or hyphens (`[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+`).
- Includes an '@' symbol.
- Followed by one or more alphanumeric characters or dots (`[A-Za-z0-9.-]+`).
- Ends with a dot followed by two or more alphabetic characters (`\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}`).

Since the string matches the pattern from the start, `re.match()` returns a match object, which evaluates to `True` in the conditional check in the `match()` method. Therefore, the method returns `True`.
