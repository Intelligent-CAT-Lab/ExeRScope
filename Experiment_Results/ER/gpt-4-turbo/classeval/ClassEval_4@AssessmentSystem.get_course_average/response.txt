<<<Analysis>>>
The `Test.test()` method initializes an instance of the `AssessmentSystem` class and manually sets the `students` dictionary with data for three students: Alice, Bob, and Charlie. The method then calls `get_course_average('Physics')` on this instance.

The `get_course_average()` method calculates the average score for a specified course across all students. It initializes `total` and `count` to zero. It then iterates over each student in the `students` dictionary:
1. For Alice, the 'Physics' course is not present, so nothing is added to `total` or `count`.
2. For Bob, the 'Physics' course is present with a score of 85. Thus, `total` becomes 85 and `count` becomes 1.
3. For Charlie, the 'Physics' course is present but the score is `None`. Since the score is `None`, it does not contribute to the `total` or `count`.

After iterating through all students, the method checks if `count` is greater than 0. Since `count` is 1, it returns the average score for 'Physics', which is `total / count = 85 / 1 = 85`.

<<<Output>>>
85
