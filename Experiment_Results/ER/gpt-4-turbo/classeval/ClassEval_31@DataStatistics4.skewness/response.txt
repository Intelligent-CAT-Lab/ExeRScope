The `Test.test()` method calls the `DataStatistics4.skewness([1, 1, 1])` method. The purpose of this method is to calculate the skewness of the data provided. Skewness measures the asymmetry of the probability distribution of a real-valued random variable about its mean.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown of the `skewness` method:
1. The input data is `[1, 1, 1]`.
2. The number of data points `n` is 3.
3. The mean of the data is calculated as `(1 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 1`.
4. The variance is calculated using the formula `sum((x - mean) ** 2 for x in data) / n`. Since all data points are equal to the mean, each term in the sum is `(1 - 1) ** 2 = 0`. Therefore, the variance is `0`.
5. The standard deviation is the square root of the variance, which is also `0`.
6. The skewness formula is `sum((x - mean) ** 3 for x in data) * n / ((n - 1) * (n - 2) * std_deviation ** 3)`. Since the standard deviation is `0`, the formula checks for this condition and returns `0` to avoid division by zero.

Thus, the skewness of a dataset where all elements are the same (and hence perfectly symmetric around the mean) is `0`.
