<<<Analysis>>>
In the `Test.test()` method, an instance of `HRManagementSystem` is created named `hr_system`. The `employees` attribute of this instance is manually set to contain one employee with ID 1 and corresponding details.

The `remove_employee` method is then called with the employee ID 1. This method checks if the employee ID exists in the `employees` dictionary:
- Since the employee ID 1 exists, it is removed from the dictionary using `del self.employees[employee_id]`.
- The method then returns `True` indicating the employee was successfully removed.

After the removal operation, the `employees` dictionary is checked again, which is now empty because the only employee was removed.

The `test()` method returns a tuple containing the result of the `remove_employee` method (`True`) and the current state of the `employees` dictionary (which is `{}` after the removal).

<<<Output>>>
(True, {})
