<<<Analysis>>>
In the `test()` method of the `Test` class, an instance of `CalendarUtil` is created. Initially, the `events` attribute of this instance is empty. The method then assigns two events to the `events` list directly. These events are scheduled for January 1, 2023, and January 2, 2023.

Next, the `remove_event()` method of the `CalendarUtil` class is called with the second event (scheduled for January 2, 2023) as the argument. The `remove_event()` method checks if the event exists in the `events` list and removes it if found. Since the event is present in the list, it is successfully removed.

Finally, the `test()` method returns the modified `events` list, which now contains only the first event (scheduled for January 1, 2023) because the second event was removed.
