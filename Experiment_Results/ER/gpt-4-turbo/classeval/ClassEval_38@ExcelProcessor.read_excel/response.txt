<<<Analysis>>>
In the `Test.test()` method, an instance of `ExcelProcessor` is created and the `read_excel` method is called with an empty string as the file name (`self.test_file_name = ''`). 

The `read_excel` method attempts to open an Excel workbook using `openpyxl.load_workbook(file_name)`. Since the file name is an empty string, this will likely cause an error when trying to open the file. The method is wrapped in a try-except block, and in case of any exception, it returns `None`.

Therefore, since an invalid file name (empty string) is provided, it is expected that an exception will occur when attempting to open the workbook, and the method will return `None`.

<<<Output>>>
None
