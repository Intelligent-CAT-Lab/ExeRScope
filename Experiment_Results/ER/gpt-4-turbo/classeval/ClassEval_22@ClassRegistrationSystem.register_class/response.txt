<<<Analysis>>>
In the `test()` method, an instance of `ClassRegistrationSystem` is created. Then, the `register_class` method is called with `student_name='John'` and `class_name='CS101'`.

The `register_class` method checks if the `student_name` exists in the `students_registration_classes` dictionary. Since this is the first time the method is called and no students have been registered yet, `student_name='John'` does not exist in the dictionary.

As a result, the method initializes a new entry in the dictionary with `student_name` as the key and a list containing `class_name` as the value. The method then returns this list.

Since no prior registration exists for 'John', the list returned will only contain the class 'CS101'.

<<<Output>>>
['CS101']
