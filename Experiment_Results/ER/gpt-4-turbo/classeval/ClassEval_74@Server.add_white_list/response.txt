<<<Analysis>>>
The `Test.test()` method initializes an instance of the `Server` class and then proceeds to add addresses to the server's white list using the `add_white_list` method. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. A `Server` instance is created. Initially, `self.white_list` is an empty list.
2. The address `88` is added to the white list. Since `88` is not in the white list, it is appended to the list, and the updated list `[88]` is returned.
3. The address `11` is added next. Similarly, `11` is not in the white list, so it is appended, and the updated list `[88, 11]` is returned.
4. The address `22` is then added. As `22` is not in the white list, it is appended, and the updated list `[88, 11, 22]` is returned.
5. Finally, the address `22` is attempted to be added again. This time, since `22` is already in the white list, the method returns `False` as per the condition in the `add_white_list` method.

Thus, the final return value of `Test.test()` is `False` because the last operation to add `22` again finds it already in the list and returns `False`.
