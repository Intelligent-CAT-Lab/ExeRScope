<<<Analysis>>>
The `Test.test()` method initializes an instance of the `Lemmatization` class and then calls the `get_pos_tag` method with the sentence "The dog's barked at the mailman.".

1. Inside `get_pos_tag`, the method `remove_punctuation` is called to remove any punctuation from the sentence. The sentence "The dog's barked at the mailman." becomes "The dogs barked at the mailman" after removing the apostrophe.
2. The cleaned sentence is tokenized into words using `word_tokenize`, resulting in the list `['The', 'dogs', 'barked', 'at', 'the', 'mailman']`.
3. `pos_tag` is then used to generate part-of-speech tags for each tokenized word. The expected output for POS tagging this list of words would be:
   - 'The' as 'DT' (determiner)
   - 'dogs' as 'NNS' (noun, plural)
   - 'barked' as 'VBD' (verb, past tense)
   - 'at' as 'IN' (preposition or subordinating conjunction)
   - 'the' as 'DT' (determiner)
   - 'mailman' as 'NN' (noun, singular)
4. These tags are collected into a list `['DT', 'NNS', 'VBD', 'IN', 'DT', 'NN']` and returned by the `get_pos_tag` method.
5. The `test` method returns both the result of the `get_pos_tag` method and the expected list of tags for comparison.

<<<Output>>>
(['DT', 'NNS', 'VBD', 'IN', 'DT', 'NN'], ['DT', 'NNS', 'VBD', 'IN', 'DT', 'NN'])
