<<<Analysis>>>
The `test()` method in the `Test` class initializes an instance of `ClassRegistrationSystem`. It then manually sets the `students` attribute of this instance with a list of dictionaries, each representing a student with their name and major.

The method then calls `get_students_by_major("Computer Science")`:
- This method initializes an empty list `student_list`.
- It iterates over each student in the `students` list.
- If a student's major matches "Computer Science", their name is appended to `student_list`.
- For the provided students list, "John" and "Bob" match the major "Computer Science", so their names are added to the list.

Next, the method calls `get_students_by_major("Mathematics")`:
- Similarly, this method initializes an empty list `student_list`.
- It iterates over each student in the `students` list.
- If a student's major matches "Mathematics", their name is appended to `student_list`.
- For the provided students list, "Alice", "Tom", and "Jerry" match the major "Mathematics", so their names are added to the list.

Finally, the method returns a tuple containing the lists of student names for the majors "Computer Science" and "Mathematics".

<<<Output>>>
(['John', 'Bob'], ['Alice', 'Tom', 'Jerry'])
