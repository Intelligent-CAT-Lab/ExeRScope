<<<Analysis>>>
In the test() method, a customer dictionary and a cart list of dictionaries are defined. The customer has a fidelity score of 1200, and the cart contains two items with specified quantities and prices.

An instance of DiscountStrategy is created with the customer and cart as arguments. The constructor (__init__) initializes the instance variables and calls the total() method to calculate the total price of the items in the cart.

The total() method calculates the total price by iterating over each item in the cart and multiplying the item's quantity by its price. The calculation is as follows:
- For the first item: 10 (quantity) * 10.0 (price) = 100.0
- For the second item: 5 (quantity) * 10.0 (price) = 50.0
The sum of these values is 150.0, which is stored in self.__total and returned.

The test() method then compares the calculated total (actual_total) with an expected value (expected_total) of 150.0. Both values should match as the calculation is straightforward.

Finally, the test() method returns a tuple containing the actual_total and expected_total.

<<<Output>>>
(150.0, 150.0)
