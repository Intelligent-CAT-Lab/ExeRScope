In the test() method, an instance of BlackjackGame is created, and then the calculate_hand_value method is called with the hand ['JS', 'QS', 'AS', 'AS', 'AS'].

Here's the breakdown of the calculate_hand_value method:
1. Initialize value to 0 and num_aces to 0.
2. Iterate through each card in the hand:
   - 'JS' and 'QS' are face cards, each adding 10 to the value. So, value becomes 20.
   - 'AS' (Ace) is encountered three times. Each 'AS' adds 11 initially, so after three Aces, the value becomes 53 (20 + 11 + 11 + 11).
   - num_aces is incremented by 3 (one for each Ace).
3. After processing all cards, check if the total value exceeds 21 and if there are any Aces that can be adjusted:
   - Since value is 53 and num_aces is 3, the loop to adjust Aces runs:
     - Reduce value by 10 (from 53 to 43), reduce num_aces by 1 (to 2).
     - Reduce value by 10 again (from 43 to 33), reduce num_aces by 1 (to 1).
     - Reduce value by 10 once more (from 33 to 23), reduce num_aces by 1 (to 0).
4. The final value after adjustments is 23, which is the total value of the hand after accounting for the Aces being either 1 or 11 to stay as close to 21 without going over.

<<<Output>>>
23
