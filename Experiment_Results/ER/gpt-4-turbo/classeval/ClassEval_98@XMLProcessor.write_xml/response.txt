<<<Analysis>>>
The `Test.test()` method performs several operations involving XML file handling and processing:

1. A temporary XML file named 'test.xml' is created with root and two item elements containing the texts "apple" and "orange".
2. An instance of `XMLProcessor` is created with 'test.xml' as the file to process.
3. The XML file is parsed, and its root is set to the processor's root attribute.
4. The `write_xml` method of `XMLProcessor` is called to write the XML content to a new file named 'output.xml'. This method should return `True` if the file is successfully written.
5. Another `XMLProcessor` instance is created for 'output.xml' to verify the contents.
6. The new XML file 'output.xml' is parsed, and its root is set to the new processor's root attribute.
7. The `findall` method is used to find all 'item' elements in the root of 'output.xml'.
8. The temporary files 'output.xml' and 'test.xml' are removed.
9. The method returns a tuple containing the result of the `write_xml` method, the root of the processed XML, and the text of the two item elements.

Since the XML content is written and read correctly, and the text in the items remains unchanged (the `process_xml_data` method which modifies the text is not called), the output should reflect the original text values of the items.

(True, <Element 'root' at MEMORY_ADDRESS>, 'apple', 'orange')
