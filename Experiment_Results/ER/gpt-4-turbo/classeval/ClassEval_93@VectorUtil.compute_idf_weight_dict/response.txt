The `Test.test()` method calls the `VectorUtil.compute_idf_weight_dict()` method with `total_num` equal to 2 and `number_dict` containing two keys with values 0.2 and 0.5. The method is designed to compute the inverse document frequency (IDF) weights for each key in the dictionary.

1. `index_2_key_map` is initialized as an empty dictionary, and `index` is set to 0.
2. `count_list` is initialized as an empty list.
3. The method iterates over the `number_dict` items:
   - For 'key1' with count 0.2, it adds 0.2 to `count_list` and maps index 0 to 'key1'.
   - For 'key2' with count 0.5, it adds 0.5 to `count_list` and maps index 1 to 'key2'.
   - `index` is incremented accordingly after each iteration.
4. `count_list` is converted to a numpy array `a`.
5. The IDF formula is applied: `a = np.log((total_num + 1) / (a + 1))`. This computes the log of the ratio of (total_num + 1) to (each count + 1).
   - For 'key1': `np.log((2 + 1) / (0.2 + 1))` = `np.log(3 / 1.2)` ≈ 1.0116
   - For 'key2': `np.log((2 + 1) / (0.5 + 1))` = `np.log(3 / 1.5)` ≈ 0.6931
6. A new dictionary `result` is created, and the computed weights are assigned to the corresponding keys using `index_2_key_map`.
7. The method returns the `result` dictionary containing the IDF weights for 'key1' and 'key2'.

The `test()` method then retrieves and returns the values for 'key1' and 'key2' from the result dictionary.
