<<<Analysis>>>
In the `test()` method, two instances of `RPGCharacter` are created: `character1` with the name "John", 100 hp, 20 attack power, and 10 defense, and `character2` with the name "Enemy", 100 hp, 15 attack power, and 5 defense.

The `attack()` method of `RPGCharacter` is called twice from `character1` targeting `character2`. The `attack()` method calculates the damage as the difference between the attacker's attack power and the defender's defense, but ensures a minimum damage of 1.

1. First attack:
   - Damage calculation: `20 (attack power of character1) - 5 (defense of character2) = 15`
   - `character2.hp` is reduced by 15, resulting in `100 - 15 = 85`.

2. Second attack:
   - Damage calculation remains the same: `20 - 5 = 15`.
   - `character2.hp` is further reduced by 15, resulting in `85 - 15 = 70`.

After these two attacks, the health points (`hp`) of `character2` are 70.

<<<Output>>>
70
