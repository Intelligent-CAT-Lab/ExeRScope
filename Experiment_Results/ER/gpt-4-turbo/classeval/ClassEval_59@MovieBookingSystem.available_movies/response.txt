<<<Analysis>>>
The `Test.test()` method initializes a `MovieBookingSystem` instance and adds two movies to the system: 'Batman' and 'Spiderman'. The `add_movie` method stores each movie as a dictionary with details including name, price, start and end times (converted from string to datetime objects), and a seating arrangement (a numpy array initialized to zeros).

The `available_movies` method is then called with the parameters '20:00' and '23:00'. This method converts these string times into datetime objects. It then checks each movie to see if its start time is greater than or equal to the provided start time and its end time is less than or equal to the provided end time.

For the movie 'Batman', the start time is '17:05' and the end time is '19:25', which does not fall within the '20:00' to '23:00' range. Therefore, it is not included in the result.

For the movie 'Spiderman', the start time is '20:00' and the end time is '22:30', which falls within the '20:00' to '23:00' range. Therefore, it is included in the result.

The method returns a list of movie names that are available within the given time range. In this case, only 'Spiderman' meets the criteria.

<<<Output>>>
['Spiderman']
