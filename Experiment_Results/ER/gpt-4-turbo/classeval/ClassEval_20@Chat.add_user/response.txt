<<<Analysis>>>
In the test() method, an instance of the Chat class is created. Initially, the users dictionary of the Chat instance is manually set to {'John': []}, indicating that there is one user named "John" with an empty list of messages.

The add_user() method is then called with the argument 'Mary'. Inside the add_user() method:
- It checks if 'Mary' is already a key in the users dictionary. Since 'Mary' is not present, it adds 'Mary' with an empty list as her value in the dictionary.
- The method then returns True, indicating that the user was successfully added.

Finally, the test() method returns a tuple containing the result of the add_user() method (True) and the current state of the users dictionary, which now includes both 'John' and 'Mary' with their respective empty message lists.

<<<Output>>>
(True, {'John': [], 'Mary': []})
