<<<Analysis>>>
The `Test.test()` method initializes an instance of the `Order` class and sets up the menu and sales discount rates. It then adds two dishes to the order: "dish1" with 2 units and "dish3" with 2 units. Both additions are successful as the counts are available in the menu.

The `calculate_total()` method is then called to compute the total cost of the selected dishes. The calculation involves iterating over each selected dish, multiplying the dish's price by the count and the sales discount rate for that dish.

Here's the breakdown:
1. "dish1" has a price of 10, count of 2, and a sales discount of 0.9. The total for "dish1" is 10 * 2 * 0.9 = 18.
2. "dish3" has a price of 20, count of 2, and a sales discount of 0.8. The total for "dish3" is 20 * 2 * 0.8 = 32.

Adding these totals gives 18 + 32 = 50.

Thus, the `calculate_total()` method returns 50, which is then returned by the `test()` method.

<<<Output>>>
50
