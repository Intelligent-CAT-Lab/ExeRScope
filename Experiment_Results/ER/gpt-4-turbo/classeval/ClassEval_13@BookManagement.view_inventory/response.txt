<<<Analysis>>>
The `Test.test()` method initializes an instance of the `BookManagement` class. The `BookManagement` class has an attribute `inventory` which is a dictionary used to store book titles and their quantities.

1. An instance of `BookManagement` is created, initializing `inventory` as an empty dictionary.
2. The `add_book` method is called with the title "book1" and quantity 2. Since "book1" is not in the inventory, it is added with a quantity of 2.
3. The `add_book` method is called again, this time with the title "book2" and the default quantity of 1. Since "book2" is not in the inventory, it is added with a quantity of 1.
4. The expected result is set as a dictionary `{"book1": 2, "book2": 1}`.
5. The method returns a tuple containing the expected dictionary and the actual `inventory` of the `bookManagement` instance.

Since the operations performed on the inventory are straightforward additions and there are no removals or exceptions, the `inventory` should match the expected result exactly.

<<<Output>>>
({"book1": 2, "book2": 1}, {"book1": 2, "book2": 1})
