<<<Analysis>>>
The `test()` method in the `Test` class creates an instance of `RegexUtils` and then calls the `sub()` method on it. The `sub()` method is used to replace occurrences of a pattern in a given text with a specified replacement string.

Here, the pattern used is `r'\b\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}\b'`, which matches strings that represent phone numbers in the format `xxx-xxx-xxxx` where `x` is a digit. The replacement string is `'phone num'`.

The input text for the `sub()` method is `"1234567890 abiguygusu 8762869876 kjgufwycs 9877629767"`. This text contains sequences of digits but none of them are in the format `xxx-xxx-xxxx`. Therefore, there are no matches for the pattern in the text.

Since there are no matches, the `sub()` method will not perform any replacements, and the output will be the same as the input text.

<<<Output>>>
"1234567890 abiguygusu 8762869876 kjgufwycs 9877629767"
