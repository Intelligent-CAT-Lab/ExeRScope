<<<Analysis>>>
The `Test.test()` method creates an instance of the `TriCalculator` class and then calls the `tan(60)` method on this instance. The `tan(x)` method internally uses the `cos(x)` and `sin(x)` methods to compute the tangent of x, where x is given in degrees.

1. **Conversion to Radians**: Both `cos(x)` and `sin(x)` first convert the angle x from degrees to radians using the formula `x = x / 180 * pi`.

2. **Computing Cosine using Taylor Series**:
   - The `cos(x)` method uses a Taylor series expansion to approximate the cosine value. It iterates 50 times (as specified in the method call `taylor(x, 50)`).
   - The series alternates between subtraction and addition of terms, which are powers of x divided by the factorial of the term's degree.
   - The factorial is computed using a while loop in the `factorial(a)` method.

3. **Computing Sine using Series Expansion**:
   - The `sin(x)` method uses another series expansion, adding terms until the next term is smaller than `1e-15`.
   - It uses a while loop to compute terms of the series, adjusting the term in each iteration based on the previous term and using factorial-like expressions for denominators.

4. **Computing Tangent**:
   - The `tan(x)` method computes the tangent by dividing the sine of x by the cosine of x.
   - If the cosine of x is zero, it returns `False` to indicate an undefined tangent (as tangent is undefined where cosine is zero).

For `x = 60` degrees:
- The cosine of 60 degrees is approximately 0.5.
- The sine of 60 degrees is approximately 0.8660254038.
- Therefore, the tangent, which is the sine divided by the cosine, would be approximately 1.7320508076.
