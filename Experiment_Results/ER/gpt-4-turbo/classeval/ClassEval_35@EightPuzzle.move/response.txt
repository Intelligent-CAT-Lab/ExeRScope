<<<Analysis>>>
The `Test.test()` method initializes an instance of the `EightPuzzle` class with an initial state of `[[2, 3, 4], [5, 0, 1], [6, 8, 7]]`. The `EightPuzzle` class is designed to solve the 8-puzzle game where the goal is to move the tiles to reach a goal state of `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 0]]`.

1. The `move` method is called with the direction 'left'. This method first finds the position of the blank (0) in the current state using the `find_blank` method. In the initial state, the blank is located at position (1, 1).

2. The `move` method then creates a deep copy of the current state to avoid modifying the original state. This is done using a list comprehension that copies each row.

3. Since the direction is 'left', the method swaps the blank with the element to its left. This results in the blank moving from position (1, 1) to (1, 0), and the element 5 moving from (1, 0) to (1, 1).

4. The new state after this move is `[[2, 3, 4], [0, 5, 1], [6, 8, 7]]`.

5. The method returns this new state, and the test method also defines an expected result of `[[2, 3, 4], [0, 5, 1], [6, 8, 7]]`.

6. Finally, the test method returns a tuple containing the result of the move and the expected result.

([[2, 3, 4], [0, 5, 1], [6, 8, 7]], [[2, 3, 4], [0, 5, 1], [6, 8, 7]])
