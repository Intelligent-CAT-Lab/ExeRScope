<<<Analysis>>>
The `Test.test()` method creates an instance of `URLHandler` with the URL "https://www.baidu.com/s?wd=aaa&rsv_spt=1#page". It then calls the `get_query_params()` method on this instance.

1. The `get_query_params()` method starts by finding the positions of the "?" and "#" in the URL to isolate the query string. In this URL, "?" is at position 27 and "#" is at position 42.
2. The query string is extracted using these positions, resulting in "wd=aaa&rsv_spt=1".
3. The method then splits this string by "&" to separate different parameters, resulting in the list ["wd=aaa", "rsv_spt=1"].
4. Each element of the list is further split by "=", which separates the keys and values:
   - "wd=aaa" splits into ["wd", "aaa"]
   - "rsv_spt=1" splits into ["rsv_spt", "1"]
5. These key-value pairs are stored in a dictionary: {'wd': 'aaa', 'rsv_spt': '1'}.
6. This dictionary is returned as the output of the `get_query_params()` method.

<<<Output>>>
{'wd': 'aaa', 'rsv_spt': '1'}
