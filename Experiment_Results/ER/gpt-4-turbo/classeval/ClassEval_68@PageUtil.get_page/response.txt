<<<Analysis>>>
In the `test()` method of the `Test` class, an instance of `PageUtil` is created with a list of integers from 1 to 10 and a page size of 3. The `PageUtil` class is designed to manage pagination of a dataset.

1. The `PageUtil` constructor (`__init__`) initializes the instance with the provided data and page size. It also calculates the total number of items (`total_items`) which is 10 in this case, and the total number of pages (`total_pages`). The total pages are calculated as `(total_items + page_size - 1) // page_size`, which results in `(10 + 3 - 1) // 3 = 4`.

2. The `get_page` method is then called with `page_number` set to 0. This method first checks if the `page_number` is less than 1 or greater than `total_pages`. Since `page_number` is 0, it is less than 1.

3. Due to the invalid `page_number`, the `get_page` method returns an empty list.

4. The `test()` method then returns a tuple containing the result of the `get_page` method (which is an empty list) and another explicitly defined empty list for comparison.

Thus, the output of the `test()` method will be a tuple of two empty lists.
