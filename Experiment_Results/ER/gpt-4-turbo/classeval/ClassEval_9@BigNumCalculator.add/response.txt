<<<Analysis>>>
The `Test.test()` method calls the `BigNumCalculator.add()` method with two string arguments representing large numbers: '123456789012345678922' and '98765432109876543210'.

1. Inside the `add()` method, the maximum length of the two numbers is determined using `max(len(num1), len2)`. Here, `len(num1) = 21` and `len(num2) = 20`, so `max_length = 21`.

2. Both numbers are zero-padded to the maximum length for alignment. `num1` remains '123456789012345678922' and `num2` becomes '098765432109876543210'.

3. The method initializes `carry = 0` and an empty list `result = []`.

4. A loop iterates over the indices of the numbers from right to left (from index 20 to 0). In each iteration, it calculates the sum of the corresponding digits of `num1` and `num2` along with the `carry`. The sum is then split into a new `carry` (for the next higher digit) and the current digit to be added to the result.

5. After processing all digits, if there is a remaining `carry`, it is added to the front of the result list.

6. The list of characters in `result` is joined to form the final string result.

Step-by-step addition:
- Digits from rightmost to leftmost are added with carry adjustments.
- For example, last digits 2 (from num1) and 0 (from num2) with carry 0 give 2. Next, 2 and 1 with carry 0 give 3, and so on.
- This continues until all digits are processed.

7. The final result after processing all digits and adjusting for carries is obtained.
