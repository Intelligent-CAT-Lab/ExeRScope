<<<Analysis>>>
The `Test.test()` method creates an instance of the `SQLGenerator` class with the table name 'table1'. It then calls the `select_by_age_range` method on this instance with arguments 50 and 60.

Inside the `select_by_age_range` method:
- A condition string is constructed using the provided minimum and maximum ages, resulting in "age BETWEEN 50 AND 60".
- This condition is passed to the `select` method.

Inside the `select` method:
- Since no fields are specified, it defaults to selecting all fields ("*").
- The SQL query constructed is "SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE age BETWEEN 50 AND 60".
- The method returns the complete SQL query string with a semicolon at the end.

Thus, the final output from the `test()` method is the SQL query string for selecting all records from 'table1' where the age is between 50 and 60.

<<<Output>>>
"SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE age BETWEEN 50 AND 60;"
