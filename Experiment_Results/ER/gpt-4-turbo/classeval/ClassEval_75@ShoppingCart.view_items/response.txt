<<<Analysis>>>
The `Test.test()` method initializes an instance of the `ShoppingCart` class. The `ShoppingCart` class has an `__init__` method that initializes an empty dictionary `items` to store the items in the cart.

The `add_item` method of the `ShoppingCart` class is then called with parameters "apple", 1, and 2. This method checks if the item "apple" is already in the `items` dictionary. Since it's not, it adds "apple" to the dictionary with a sub-dictionary containing the 'price' set to 1 and 'quantity' set to 2.

After adding the item, the `view_items` method is called. This method simply returns the `items` dictionary. At this point, the dictionary contains one key-value pair: `"apple": {"price": 1, "quantity": 2}`.

Therefore, the output of the `test()` method will be the dictionary showing the items in the shopping cart, which includes one item "apple" with a price of 1 and a quantity of 2.

<<<Output>>>
{'apple': {'price': 1, 'quantity': 2}}
