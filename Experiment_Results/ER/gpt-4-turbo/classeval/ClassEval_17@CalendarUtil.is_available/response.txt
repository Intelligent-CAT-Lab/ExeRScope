<<<Analysis>>>
In the `test()` method of the `Test` class, an instance of `CalendarUtil` is created. The `events` attribute of this instance is then manually set to contain one event on January 1, 2023, from 00:00 to 01:00 with a description of 'New Year'.

The `is_available()` method of the `CalendarUtil` class is then called with the start time and end time both set to January 1, 2023, from 00:00 to 01:00. This method checks if there is any overlap between the given time range and the times of the events in the `events` list.

The method iterates over the `events` list and checks if the given start time is before the event's end time and the given end time is after the event's start time. In this case, the event in the list is exactly within the queried time range, so the condition `start_time < event['end_time'] and end_time > event['start_time']` evaluates to `True`, indicating an overlap.

Since there is an overlap, the method returns `False`, indicating that the time slot is not available.
