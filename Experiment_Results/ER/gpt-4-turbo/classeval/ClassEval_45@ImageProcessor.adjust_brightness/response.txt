<<<Analysis>>>
The `Test.test()` method performs several operations using the `ImageProcessor` class to manipulate an image and then compares the result with an expected outcome.

1. An instance of `ImageProcessor` is created.
2. A new image (`test.png`) is created with dimensions 100x100 and a white background (RGB values of 255, 255, 255). This image is saved to the disk.
3. The `load_image` method of `ImageProcessor` loads this newly created image from the disk.
4. An `ImageEnhance.Brightness` object is created directly using the `Image.open` method for the same image path, and the brightness is adjusted by a factor of 0.5, resulting in `expected_image`.
5. The `adjust_brightness` method of `ImageProcessor` is then called with a factor of 0.5 to adjust the brightness of the image loaded in the `ImageProcessor` instance.
6. The `ImageChops.difference` function is used to compute the difference between `expected_image` and the image stored in `ImageProcessor` after brightness adjustment.
7. The `.getbbox()` method is called on the result of the difference. If there is no difference between the two images, `.getbbox()` returns `None`.

The test checks if the result of `.getbbox()` is `None`, which would indicate that there is no difference between the expected image and the processed image, meaning the `adjust_brightness` method worked as intended.
