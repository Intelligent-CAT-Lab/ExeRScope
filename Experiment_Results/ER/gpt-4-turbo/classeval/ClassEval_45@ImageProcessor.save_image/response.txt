<<<Analysis>>>
In the `test()` method of the `Test` class, the following steps are executed:

1. An instance of `ImageProcessor` is created.
2. A new image file "test.png" is created using PIL's `Image.new()` method. This image is a 100x100 pixel image with a white background (RGB values of 255, 255, 255).
3. The newly created image is saved to the path specified by `self.image_path`.
4. The `load_image()` method of the `ImageProcessor` instance is called with `self.image_path`, loading the image into the `ImageProcessor`'s `image` attribute.
5. The `save_image()` method is then called with `save_path`, saving the image to a new file "test_save.png".
6. The saved image is then loaded from `save_path` using `Image.open(save_path)`.

The final step returns the `saved_image` object, which is an instance of PIL's `Image` class representing the image saved at "test_save.png". This image is identical to the one created and saved initially, as no modifications were made to the image between loading and saving.
