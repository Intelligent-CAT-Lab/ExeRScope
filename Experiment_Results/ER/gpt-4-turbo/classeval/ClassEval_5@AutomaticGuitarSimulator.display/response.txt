<<<Analysis>>>
In the provided code, the `Test.test()` method creates an instance of `AutomaticGuitarSimulator` with an empty string as its input. This instance is stored in the variable `context`.

The `test()` method then calls the `display()` method of the `AutomaticGuitarSimulator` class, passing two empty strings as arguments for the parameters `key` and `value`.

The `display()` method formats these inputs into a string using the specified format: "Normal Guitar Playing -- Chord: %s, Play Tune: %s". Since both `key` and `value` are empty strings, the placeholders `%s` are replaced with these empty strings.

Therefore, the output of the `display()` method will be "Normal Guitar Playing -- Chord: , Play Tune: " with no values between the colons and the commas.

<<<Output>>>
"Normal Guitar Playing -- Chord: , Play Tune: "
