<<<Analysis>>>
In the `test()` method of the `Test` class, an instance of `JSONProcessor` is created. Then, a dictionary `test_data` is defined with three key-value pairs. A file path `test_only_read.json` is set up and the file is created with JSON content `{"key1": "value1"}`. The file permissions are then set to read-only for all users (owner, group, and others) using `os.chmod`.

The `write_json` method of `JSONProcessor` is called with `test_data` and the read-only file path `test_only_read.json`. Inside `write_json`, the method attempts to open the file in write mode (`'w'`) and write data to it using `json.dump`. However, because the file permissions are set to read-only, this operation will fail.

When an exception occurs due to the inability to write to a read-only file, the `write_json` method catches the exception and returns `-1` to indicate the failure.
