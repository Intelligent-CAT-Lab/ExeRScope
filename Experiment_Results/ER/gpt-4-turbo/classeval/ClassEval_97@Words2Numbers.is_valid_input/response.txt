<<<Analysis>>>
The `Test.test()` method creates an instance of the `Words2Numbers` class and then calls the `is_valid_input` method with the input string 'fifteenth hundred'.

1. The `is_valid_input` method first replaces hyphens with spaces, but since there are no hyphens in 'fifteenth hundred', the string remains unchanged.

2. The method then splits the string into words and processes each word:
   - The word 'fifteenth' is checked against the `ordinal_words` dictionary and is not found.
   - The method then checks if 'fifteenth' ends with any of the suffixes in `ordinal_endings`. It finds 'ieth' and replaces it with 'y', transforming 'fifteenth' to 'fifty'.
   - 'fifty' is found in the `numwords` dictionary, so processing continues.
   - The next word 'hundred' is directly found in the `numwords` dictionary.

3. Since all words in the input string are either transformed and found in the `numwords` dictionary or directly found, the method returns `True`.
