<<<Analysis>>>
The `Test.test()` method calls the `remove` method of the `BitStatusUtil` class with arguments `states=6` and `stat=2`.

1. Inside the `remove` method, the `check` method is called first to validate the inputs. The `check` method iterates over the arguments and checks if any of them are negative or odd. Both 6 and 2 are non-negative and even, so no exception is raised.

2. The `has` method is then called to check if the bit represented by `stat` (2) is set in `states` (6). The bitwise AND operation `6 & 2` results in 2, which equals `stat`, so `has` returns `True`.

3. Since `has` returned `True`, the `remove` method proceeds to clear the bit represented by `stat` from `states`. This is done using the bitwise XOR operation `6 ^ 2`, which results in 4.

4. The `remove` method then returns the result of the XOR operation, which is 4.
