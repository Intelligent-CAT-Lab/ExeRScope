<<<Analysis>>>
The `test()` method in the `Test` class creates an instance of `RegexUtils` and then calls the `extract_email` method with the string "abcdefg@.com ygusyfysy@126.com wljduyuv@qq.com".

1. Inside `extract_email`, the method `generate_email_pattern` is called to get the regex pattern for matching email addresses. The pattern used is `r'\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\b'`.
2. This pattern is then used in the `findall` method to find all occurrences of this pattern in the provided text.
3. The regex pattern checks for word boundaries followed by one or more characters that can be alphanumeric, dots, underscores, percent signs, plus signs, or hyphens, followed by an '@' symbol, then more alphanumeric characters or dots, and finally a dot followed by two or more alphabetic characters.
4. Analyzing the input string:
   - "abcdefg@.com" does not match because there's no valid domain name after '@'.
   - "ygusyfysy@126.com" matches the pattern.
   - "wljduyuv@qq.com" matches the pattern.
5. The `findall` method will return a list of strings that match the email pattern from the input text.

<<<Output>>>
['ygusyfysy@126.com', 'wljduyuv@qq.com']
