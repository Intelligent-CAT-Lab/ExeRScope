<<<Analysis>>>
The `Test.test()` method initializes an instance of the `BookManagement` class. The `BookManagement` class has an attribute `inventory` which is a dictionary used to store book titles and their quantities.

1. An instance of `BookManagement` is created, initializing `self.inventory` as an empty dictionary.
2. The `add_book` method is called with the arguments "book1" and 2. Since "book1" is not in the inventory, it is added to the dictionary with a quantity of 2.
3. The `view_book_quantity` method is then called with the argument 'book1'. This method checks if 'book1' is in the inventory. Since it is, the method returns the quantity of 'book1', which is 2.

The sequence of method calls and their effects on the `inventory` dictionary are straightforward, leading to the final output when querying the quantity of 'book1'.
