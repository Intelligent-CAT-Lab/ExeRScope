<<<Analysis>>>
In the `test()` method of the `Test` class, an instance of `PageUtil` is created with a list of integers from 1 to 10 and a page size of 3. The `search()` method of the `PageUtil` class is then called with the keyword "2".

The `search()` method iterates over the `data` list to find items that contain the keyword "2" when converted to a string. In this case, the only integer that matches is 2. The method constructs a list `results` containing just this integer.

The number of results is calculated to be 1, and since the page size is 3, the total number of pages required to display all results is 1.

The `search()` method returns a dictionary containing the search keyword, the total number of results, the total number of pages, and the list of results.

The `test()` method then returns a tuple containing the actual results from the `search()` method and the expected results dictionary, which is manually defined in the test method to match the actual results.
