<<<Analysis>>>
The `test()` method in the `Test` class creates an instance of `DataStatistics` and then calls the `mode()` method with the data list `[2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]`.

Inside the `mode()` method:
1. A `Counter` object is created from the data list, which counts the occurrences of each element. The resulting `Counter` object would be `{2: 2, 3: 2, 4: 3}`.
2. The maximum count value (`mode_count`) is determined using `max(counter.values())`, which in this case is `3` (since the number `4` appears three times).
3. A list comprehension is used to find all elements that have a count equal to `mode_count`. Here, only the number `4` has the count of `3`.
4. The method returns a list containing the mode(s). In this case, it returns `[4]` because `4` is the only number that appears most frequently (3 times).
