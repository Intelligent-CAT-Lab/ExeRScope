<<<Analysis>>>
The `Test.test()` method initializes an instance of `ClassRegistrationSystem` and manually sets the `students` and `students_registration_classes` attributes with predefined data. The method then calls `get_most_popular_class_in_major()` for both "Computer Science" and "Mathematics" majors.

1. For "Computer Science":
   - The students "John", "Bob", and "Alice" are considered.
   - Their registered classes are combined: ["Algorithms", "Data Structures"], ["Data Structures", "Algorithms", "Operating Systems"], ["Data Structures", "Operating Systems", "Calculus"].
   - The combined list of classes is: ["Algorithms", "Data Structures", "Data Structures", "Algorithms", "Operating Systems", "Data Structures", "Operating Systems", "Calculus"].
   - The most frequent class in this list is "Data Structures" (appearing 3 times).

2. For "Mathematics":
   - The students "Tom" and "Jerry" are considered.
   - Their registered classes are combined: ["Calculus", "Linear Algebra"], ["Linear Algebra", "Statistics"].
   - The combined list of classes is: ["Calculus", "Linear Algebra", "Linear Algebra", "Statistics"].
   - The most frequent class in this list is "Linear Algebra" (appearing 2 times).

The method returns a tuple containing the most popular classes for "Computer Science" and "Mathematics", which are "Data Structures" and "Linear Algebra", respectively.

<<<Output>>>
('Data Structures', 'Linear Algebra')
