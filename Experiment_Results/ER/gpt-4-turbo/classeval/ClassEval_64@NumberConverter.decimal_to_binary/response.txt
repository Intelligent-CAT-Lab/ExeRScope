<<<Analysis>>>
The `test()` method in the `Test` class calls the `decimal_to_binary()` method of the `NumberConverter` class with the decimal number 169815 as an argument. The purpose of the `decimal_to_binary()` method is to convert a decimal number to its binary representation.

Here's the step-by-step process:
1. The method receives the decimal number 169815.
2. It uses Python's built-in `bin()` function to convert the decimal number to a binary string. The `bin()` function returns a string that starts with '0b', which represents that the number is in binary format.
3. The method then slices the string from the third character to the end using `[2:]` to remove the '0b' prefix, leaving only the binary digits.
4. The resulting binary string is then returned.

Let's manually convert 169815 to binary to verify:
- 169815 in binary is 1010010111000111111.

<<<Output>>>
1010010111000111111
