<<<Analysis>>>
The `Test.test()` method creates an instance of `ComplexCalculator` and then calls the `multiply` method with two complex numbers: `1 + 2j` and `3 + 4j`.

The `multiply` method calculates the product of two complex numbers using the formula:
\[ (a + bi) \times (c + di) = (ac - bd) + (ad + bc)i \]
Where:
- \( a = 1 \) (real part of the first complex number)
- \( b = 2 \) (imaginary part of the first complex number)
- \( c = 3 \) (real part of the second complex number)
- \( d = 4 \) (imaginary part of the second complex number)

Using the formula:
- Real part = \( 1 \times 3 - 2 \times 4 = 3 - 8 = -5 \)
- Imaginary part = \( 1 \times 4 + 2 \times 3 = 4 + 6 = 10 \)

Thus, the result of the multiplication is:
\[ -5 + 10i \]

This result is returned as a complex number from the `multiply` method.

<<<Output>>>
(-5+10j)
