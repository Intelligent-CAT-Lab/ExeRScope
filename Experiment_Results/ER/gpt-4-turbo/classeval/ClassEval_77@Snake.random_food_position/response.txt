<<<Analysis>>>
The `Test.test()` method initializes an instance of the `Snake` class with specific parameters: `SCREEN_WIDTH=100`, `SCREEN_HEIGHT=100`, `BLOCK_SIZE=1`, and an initial `food_position` of `(0, 0)`. 

1. **Initialization**: The `Snake` constructor sets the initial snake length to 1, positions the snake at the center of the screen, which is `(50, 50)` given the screen dimensions and block size, and initializes the score to 0.

2. **Random Food Position**: The `random_food_position()` method is called. This method changes the `food_position` if it coincides with the snake's current position. It generates a new position using `random.randint()` within the screen dimensions divided by the block size. Since the block size is 1, the food can appear anywhere from `(0, 0)` to `(99, 99)`.

3. **Return Values**: The method returns a tuple containing multiple references to `snake.food_position` and individual x and y coordinates of the food position. Since `random_food_position()` is called only once, all references to `snake.food_position` in the tuple will point to the same coordinates, which are the newly generated random coordinates.

Given the randomness in the `random_food_position()` method, the exact values of `snake.food_position[0]` and `snake.food_position[1]` cannot be predicted without knowing the output of the random function. However, we know that they will be within the range of 0 to 99.

<<<Output>>>
((x, y), (x, y), [(50.0, 50.0)], x, y, x, y)
Where x and y are integers between 0 and 99, inclusive.
