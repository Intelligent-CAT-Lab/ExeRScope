<<<Analysis>>>
In the `test()` method of the `Test` class, the following steps are executed:

1. A `TextFileProcessor` object is instantiated with a file path `'test.txt'`.
2. The `read_file` method of the `TextFileProcessor` class is mocked to return the string `'Hello, 123 World!'`.
3. The `write_file` method of the `TextFileProcessor` class is also mocked to avoid actual file writing.
4. The `process_file` method is called on the `TextFileProcessor` instance. This method:
   - Calls the mocked `read_file` method, which returns `'Hello, 123 World!'`.
   - Filters out non-alphabetic characters, resulting in the string `'HelloWorld'`.
   - Calls the mocked `write_file` method with the filtered content `'HelloWorld'`.
5. The `read_file` method is checked to ensure it was called once.
6. The `write_file` method is checked to ensure it was called once with the argument `'HelloWorld'`.
7. The method returns a tuple containing the result of the `process_file` method (`'HelloWorld'`) and the expected result (`'HelloWorld'`).

<<<Output>>>
('HelloWorld', 'HelloWorld')
