<<<Analysis>>>
The `Test.test()` method creates an instance of the `ExpressionCalculator` class and then calls the `is_operator` method with the argument `'-'`. The `is_operator` method is designed to check if a given character is an operator. According to the method implementation, it checks if the character is in the set `{'+', '-', '*', '/', '(', ')', '%'}`. Since `'-'` is indeed in this set, the method will return `True`.

<<<Output>>>
True
