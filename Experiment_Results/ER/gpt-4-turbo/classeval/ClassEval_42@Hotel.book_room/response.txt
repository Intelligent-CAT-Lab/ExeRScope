<<<Analysis>>>
The `Test.test()` method initializes a `Hotel` object with the name 'peace hotel' and a dictionary indicating that there are 3 single rooms and 2 double rooms available. The `book_room` method is then called on this `Hotel` object to book 2 single rooms for 'guest 1'.

1. The `book_room` method first checks if the room type 'single' exists in the `available_rooms` dictionary, which it does.
2. It then checks if the number of rooms requested (2) is less than or equal to the available rooms of that type (3). This condition is also true.
3. Since 'single' is not yet a key in the `booked_rooms` dictionary, it initializes an empty dictionary for 'single'.
4. It then adds 'guest 1' to the `booked_rooms` dictionary under 'single' with 2 rooms booked.
5. The number of available 'single' rooms is then decreased by 2, resulting in 1 remaining single room.

The method returns "Success!" to indicate the booking was successful. The `booked_rooms` dictionary now shows that 'guest 1' has 2 single rooms booked. The `available_rooms` dictionary is updated to show 1 single room and 2 double rooms remaining.

<<<Output>>>
("Success!", {'single': {'guest 1': 2}}, {'single': 1, 'double': 2})
