<<<Analysis>>>
In the `test()` method of the `Test` class, an instance of `ArrangementCalculator` is created with a list containing a single element `[1]`. The method `select_all()` of this instance is then called.

The `select_all()` method initializes an empty list `result`. It then iterates over a range from 1 to the length of `datas` plus 1. Since `datas` contains only one element, the range will be from 1 to 2.

During the iteration:
- For `i=1`, the `select()` method is called with `m=1`.
- Inside `select()`, if `m` is `None`, it would be set to the length of `datas`, but here it is explicitly passed as 1.
- The `itertools.permutations(self.datas, m)` generates all permutations of `datas` taken `m` at a time. Since `datas` is `[1]` and `m=1`, the only permutation is `(1,)`.
- This tuple `(1,)` is converted to a list `[1]` and added to the `result` list of the `select()` method.
- The `select()` method returns a list containing the single permutation: `[[1]]`.

Back in `select_all()`, this list `[[1]]` is extended into the `result` list, which finally contains `[[1]]`.

The `select_all()` method returns `[[1]]`, and this is stored in the variable `res`. The variable `expected` is manually set to `[[1]]`.

The `test()` method returns a tuple containing `res` and `expected`, both of which are `[[1]]`.
