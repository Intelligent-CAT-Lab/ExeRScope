<<<Analysis>>>
The `Test.test()` method initializes a `DiscountStrategy` object with a customer, a cart, and a specific promotion strategy (`BulkItemPromo`). The customer has a fidelity score of 1200, and the cart contains two products. The first product has a quantity of 20 and a price of 10.0, and the second product has a quantity of 5 and a price of 5.0.

The `DiscountStrategy` class calculates the total price of the cart in its `total()` method, which is called during initialization. The total is calculated as follows:
- For the first product: 20 * 10.0 = 200.0
- For the second product: 5 * 5.0 = 25.0
- Total cart value = 200.0 + 25.0 = 225.0

The `BulkItemPromo` promotion is applied, which provides a discount for items with a quantity of 20 or more. The discount is 10% of the price of such items. In this case, only the first product qualifies:
- Discount for the first product: 20 * 10.0 * 0.1 = 20.0

The `test()` method then calculates the actual discount using the `BulkItemPromo` method and compares it to an expected discount value of 20.0.

<<<Output>>>
(20.0, 20.0)
