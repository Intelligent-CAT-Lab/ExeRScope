<<<Analysis>>>
The `Test.test()` method creates an instance of the `AvgPartition` class with the list `[1, 2, 3, 4]` and a limit of `2`. The `get` method is then called with the index `1`.

1. The `AvgPartition` class is initialized with `lst = [1, 2, 3, 4]` and `limit = 2`.
2. The `get` method is called with `index = 1`.
3. Inside the `get` method, it first calls `setNum()` to determine the size of each partition and the remainder if the list doesn't divide evenly.
   - `size` is calculated as `len(lst) // limit = 4 // 2 = 2`.
   - `remainder` is calculated as `len(lst) % limit = 4 % 2 = 0`.
   - `setNum()` returns `(2, 0)`.
4. Back in the `get` method:
   - `start` is calculated as `index * size + min(index, remainder) = 1 * 2 + min(1, 0) = 2`.
   - `end` is initially set to `start + size = 2 + 2 = 4`.
   - Since `index + 1` is not less than or equal to `remainder` (`2` is not less than or equal to `0`), `end` remains `4`.
5. The method returns the sublist from `start` to `end`: `lst[2:4]` which is `[3, 4]`.
