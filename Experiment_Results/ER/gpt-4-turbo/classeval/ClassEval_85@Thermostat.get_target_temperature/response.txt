<<<Analysis>>>
In the provided code, the `Test.test()` method creates an instance of the `Thermostat` class with the parameters `current_temperature=25`, `target_temperature=25`, and `mode='cool'`. The method then calls `get_target_temperature()` on this instance.

The `get_target_temperature()` method of the `Thermostat` class simply returns the value of the instance's `target_temperature` attribute. Since the `target_temperature` was set to 25 during the initialization of the `Thermostat` instance, the method will return 25.

<<<Output>>>
25
