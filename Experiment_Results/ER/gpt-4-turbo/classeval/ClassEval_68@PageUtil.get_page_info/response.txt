<<<Analysis>>>
The `Test.test()` method initializes a `PageUtil` object with a list of integers from 1 to 10 and a page size of 3. The `PageUtil` class is designed to manage pagination of a dataset.

1. The `PageUtil` constructor calculates `total_items` as 10 (since there are 10 elements in the list).
2. It calculates `total_pages` using the formula `(total_items + page_size - 1) // page_size`. This results in `(10 + 3 - 1) // 3 = 12 // 3 = 4`. So, there are 4 pages in total.

The `get_page_info` method is then called with `page_number` set to 3:
- It first checks if the page number is valid (i.e., between 1 and `total_pages`). Since 3 is a valid page number, it proceeds.
- It calculates the `start_index` for the data slice as `(page_number - 1) * page_size = (3 - 1) * 3 = 6`.
- The `end_index` is calculated as `start_index + page_size = 6 + 3 = 9`. However, since Python list slicing is exclusive of the end index, it effectively considers indices 6, 7, and 8.
- The data slice from index 6 to 8 in the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]` is `[7, 8, 9]`.

The method then constructs a dictionary `page_info` with the following keys:
- `"current_page": 3`
- `"per_page": 3`
- `"total_pages": 4`
- `"total_items": 10`
- `"has_previous": True` (since the current page is greater than 1)
- `"has_next": True` (since the current page is less than `total_pages`)
- `"data": [7, 8, 9]` (the slice of data for the current page)

The method returns this dictionary. The test method then returns a tuple containing the actual page info and the expected page info (which is manually set to the same values).
