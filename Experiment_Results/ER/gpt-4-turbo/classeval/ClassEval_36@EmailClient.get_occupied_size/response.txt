<<<Analysis>>>
In the `test()` method of the `Test` class, an instance of `EmailClient` named `sender` is created with an email address 'sender@example.com' and a capacity of 100. Another instance named `receiver` is created with 'receiver@example.com' and a capacity of 50, but it is not used in the test.

The `inbox` of the `sender` is manually populated with two emails:
1. An email with a size of 20.
2. Another email with a size of 30.

The `get_occupied_size()` method of the `sender` instance is then called. This method calculates the total size of all emails in the `inbox`. It initializes `occupied_size` to 0 and iterates over each email in the `inbox`, adding the size of each email to `occupied_size`.

The calculation proceeds as follows:
- Start with `occupied_size` = 0.
- Add the size of the first email (20) to `occupied_size`, resulting in `occupied_size` = 20.
- Add the size of the second email (30) to `occupied_size`, resulting in `occupied_size` = 50.

Finally, the method returns the total `occupied_size`, which is 50.

<<<Output>>>
50
