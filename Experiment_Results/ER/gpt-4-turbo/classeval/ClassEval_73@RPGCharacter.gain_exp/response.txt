<<<Analysis>>>
The `test()` method in the `Test` class creates an instance of `RPGCharacter` named "John" with initial attributes: hp=100, attack_power=20, defense=10, and level=1 (default). The `gain_exp` method is then called with an argument of 400.

Here's the breakdown of the `gain_exp` method:
1. The character starts with level 1 and exp 0. The experience required to level up from level 1 to level 2 is 100 (level * 100).
2. The method checks if adding 400 exp will exceed or meet the required 100 exp to level up. It does, so 100 exp is used to level up, and 300 exp remains.
3. The character levels up using the `level_up` method:
   - Level increases from 1 to 2.
   - HP increases by 20, making it 120.
   - Attack power increases by 5, making it 25.
   - Defense increases by 5, making it 15.
   - Experience is reset to 0 after leveling up.
4. The process repeats for the next level (from level 2 to 3, requiring 200 exp). 200 exp is used, and 100 exp remains.
5. The character levels up again:
   - Level increases from 2 to 3.
   - HP increases by 20, making it 140.
   - Attack power increases by 5, making it 30.
   - Defense increases by 5, making it 20.
   - Experience is reset to 0.
6. The process repeats for the next level (from level 3 to 4, requiring 300 exp). Since only 100 exp remains, it is insufficient to level up again.
7. The remaining 100 exp is added to the character's current exp.

After processing the `gain_exp` method, the character's level is 3 and the remaining exp is 100.
