<<<Analysis>>>
In the test() method of the Test class, an instance of MahjongConnect is created with a board size of 4x4 and a list of icons ['a', 'b', 'c']. The board is then manually set to a specific configuration:
[['a', 'b', 'c', 'a'],
 ['a', 'b', 'c', 'a'],
 ['a', 'b', 'c', 'a'],
 ['a', 'b', 'c', 'a']]

The method remove_icons() is called with positions (3, 0) and (2, 0). This method sets the icons at these positions to ' ' (space). The positions (3, 0) and (2, 0) correspond to the icons at the first column of the last two rows of the board. Both of these positions contain the icon 'a'.

After executing remove_icons(), the board will be updated as follows:
[['a', 'b', 'c', 'a'],
 ['a', 'b', 'c', 'a'],
 [' ', 'b', 'c', 'a'],
 [' ', 'b', 'c', 'a']]

The test() method then returns the updated board.

<<<Output>>>
[['a', 'b', 'c', 'a'], ['a', 'b', 'c', 'a'], [' ', 'b', 'c', 'a'], [' ', 'b', 'c', 'a']]
