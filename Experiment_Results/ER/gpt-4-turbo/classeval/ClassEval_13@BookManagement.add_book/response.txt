<<<Analysis>>>
The `Test.test()` method initializes an instance of the `BookManagement` class and then adds books to the inventory using the `add_book` method.

1. An instance of `BookManagement` is created, initializing an empty inventory dictionary.
2. The `add_book` method is called with the title "book1" and quantity 2. Since "book1" is not in the inventory, it is added with a quantity of 2.
3. The `add_book` method is called again with the title "book1" but without specifying the quantity, so it defaults to 1. Since "book1" is already in the inventory, its quantity is increased by 1, resulting in a total quantity of 3 for "book1".
4. Finally, the inventory dictionary is returned, which now contains "book1" with a quantity of 3.

<<<Output>>>
{'book1': 3}
