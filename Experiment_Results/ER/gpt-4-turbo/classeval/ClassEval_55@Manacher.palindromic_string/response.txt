<<<Analysis>>>
The `Test.test()` method creates an instance of the `Manacher` class with the input string 'ababax'. It then calls the `palindromic_string()` method on this instance.

1. **Initialization**: The `palindromic_string()` method initializes `max_length` to 0, `new_input_string` to an empty string, and `output_string` to an empty string.

2. **Transform Input String**: The input string 'ababax' is transformed into 'a|b|a|b|a|x' by inserting '|' between each character. This transformation helps in handling palindromes of even length.

3. **Find Longest Palindrome**:
   - The method iterates over each character in `new_input_string`.
   - For each character at index `i`, it calls `palindromic_length(i, 1, new_input_string)` to calculate the length of the palindrome centered at `i`.
   - The `palindromic_length` function recursively checks characters equidistant from `i` until it finds characters that do not match or reaches the boundary of the string. It returns the count of matching pairs.
   - If the palindrome length at `i` is greater than `max_length`, it updates `max_length` and records the center `start`.

4. **Construct Output**:
   - After finding the center and maximum length of the longest palindrome, it constructs the palindrome string by iterating over `new_input_string` from `start - max_length` to `start + max_length + 1` and concatenates characters that are not '|'.

5. **Example Calculation**:
   - For 'a|b|a|b|a|x', the longest palindrome centered is around the middle 'a' (index 4 in the transformed string), with a length of 5 (including '|').
   - The output string is constructed from indices 2 to 6, resulting in 'ababa'.
