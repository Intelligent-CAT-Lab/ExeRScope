The `Test.test()` method invokes the `MetricsCalculator2.map()` method with a list of tuples as input. Each tuple contains a list representing binary relevance (1 for relevant, 0 for not relevant) and an integer representing the total number of items.

The `map()` method first checks if the input data is a list or tuple and then processes each tuple in the list. For each tuple:
1. Convert the sublist into a numpy array.
2. Calculate the ranking array which is the reciprocal of the rank positions (1, 1/2, 1/3, ...).
3. Initialize a list `right_ranking_list` to store the ranks of relevant items.
4. Iterate through the sublist, and for each relevant item (1), append its rank to `right_ranking_list`. For non-relevant items (0), append 0.
5. Calculate the average precision (AP) by summing the product of `right_ranking_list` and `ranking_array`, then dividing by the total number of items.

For the input `([1, 0, 1, 1], 4)`:
- `sub_list` = [1, 0, 1, 1]
- `ranking_array` = [1.0, 0.5, 0.333, 0.25]
- `right_ranking_list` = [1, 0, 2, 3]
- AP calculation: (1*1.0 + 0*0.5 + 2*0.333 + 3*0.25) / 4 = (1.0 + 0 + 0.666 + 0.75) / 4 = 0.604

For the input `([0, 1, 0, 0], 4)`:
- `sub_list` = [0, 1, 0, 0]
- `ranking_array` = [1.0, 0.5, 0.333, 0.25]
- `right_ranking_list` = [0, 1, 0, 0]
- AP calculation: (0*1.0 + 1*0.5 + 0*0.333 + 0*0.25) / 4 = (0 + 0.5 + 0 + 0) / 4 = 0.125

Finally, the method returns the mean of the AP values and the list of AP values:
- Mean AP = (0.604 + 0.125) / 2 = 0.3645
- List of AP values = [0.604, 0.125]

<<<Output>>>
(0.3645, [0.604, 0.125])
