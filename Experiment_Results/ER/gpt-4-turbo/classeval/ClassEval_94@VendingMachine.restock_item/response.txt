<<<Analysis>>>
In the `test()` method of the `Test` class, an instance of `VendingMachine` is created. The `inventory` attribute of this instance is then manually set to contain two items: 'Coke' and 'Pizza', each with a price of 1.25 and a quantity of 10.

The `restock_item()` method of the `VendingMachine` class is then called with the arguments 'Pizza' and 10. This method checks if the item 'Pizza' exists in the inventory, which it does. It then increases the quantity of 'Pizza' by 10 units. The new quantity of 'Pizza' becomes 20. The method returns `True` because the item was successfully found and restocked.

Finally, the `test()` method returns a tuple containing the result of the `restock_item()` method call (`True`) and the updated state of the `inventory` attribute of the `VendingMachine` instance. The updated inventory shows 'Coke' with a quantity of 10 and 'Pizza' with a quantity of 20.

<<<Output>>>
(True, {'Coke': {'price': 1.25, 'quantity': 10}, 'Pizza': {'price': 1.25, 'quantity': 20}})
