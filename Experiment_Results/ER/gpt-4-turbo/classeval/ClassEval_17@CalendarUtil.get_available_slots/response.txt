<<<Analysis>>>
In the `Test.test()` method, an instance of `CalendarUtil` is created and an event is added to its `events` list. The event is scheduled for January 2, 2023, from 1:00 AM to 2:00 AM.

The method `get_available_slots(datetime(2023, 1, 1))` is called to find available 1-hour slots for January 1, 2023. The method initializes `start_time` at midnight (00:00) of January 1, 2023, and `end_time` at 23:59 of the same day.

The method then iterates over each hour of the day, checking if the slot is available using the `is_available()` method. Since the event added to the calendar is on January 2, 2023, it does not affect the availability of any slots on January 1, 2023.

The `is_available()` method checks if there is any overlap between the given slot and the events in the calendar. Since there are no events on January 1, all slots from 00:00 to 23:00 are available.

There are 24 hours in a day, and since each slot is 1 hour long, there should be 24 available slots on January 1, 2023.

<<<Output>>>
24
