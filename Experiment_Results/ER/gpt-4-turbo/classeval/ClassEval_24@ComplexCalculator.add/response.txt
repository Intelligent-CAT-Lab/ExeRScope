<<<Analysis>>>
The `Test.test()` method creates an instance of `ComplexCalculator` and then calls the `add` method with two complex numbers `(1 + 2j)` and `(3 + 4j)` as arguments.

Inside the `add` method:
- The real part of the first complex number (`c1.real`) is 1 and the real part of the second complex number (`c2.real`) is 3. These are added together to get a new real part: `1 + 3 = 4`.
- The imaginary part of the first complex number (`c1.imag`) is 2 and the imaginary part of the second complex number (`c2.imag`) is 4. These are added together to get a new imaginary part: `2 + 4 = 6`.
- A new complex number is created with these calculated real and imaginary parts, resulting in `complex(4, 6)`.

Thus, the method returns the complex number `4 + 6j`.
<<<Output>>>
(4+6j)
