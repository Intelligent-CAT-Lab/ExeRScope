<<<Analysis>>>
In the `test()` method of the `Test` class, an instance of `StockPortfolioTracker` is created with an initial cash balance of 10000.0. The portfolio of this tracker is then manually set to contain one stock entry for 'AAPL' with a price of 0.0 and a quantity of 10.

The `calculate_portfolio_value()` method of `StockPortfolioTracker` is called to compute the total value of the portfolio. This method initializes `total_value` with the current cash balance, which is 10000.0. It then iterates over each stock in the portfolio, adding the product of the stock's price and quantity to `total_value`. 

For the stock 'AAPL', the price is 0.0 and the quantity is 10, so the contribution to the portfolio value from this stock is 0.0 * 10 = 0.0. Therefore, the total value of the portfolio remains 10000.0, as the stock 'AAPL' does not add any additional value due to its zero price.

Finally, the method returns the total portfolio value, which is 10000.0.

<<<Output>>>
10000.0
