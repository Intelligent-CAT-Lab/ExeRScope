<<<Analysis>>>
The `test()` method in the `Test` class calls the `median()` method from the `Statistics3` class with the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]` as an argument. The `median()` method first sorts the data, which remains `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]` since the input list is already sorted. It then calculates the length of the sorted data, which is 8. Since 8 is an even number, the method calculates the median for an even number of elements by taking the average of the middle two elements. These elements are at indices `n//2 - 1` and `n//2`, which are `8//2 - 1 = 3` and `8//2 = 4`. The values at these indices are 4 and 5, respectively. The median is calculated as `(4 + 5) / 2 = 4.5`.
