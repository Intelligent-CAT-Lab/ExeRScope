<<<Analysis>>>
In the test() method, two instances of EmailClient are created: sender and receiver. The receiver is initialized with an address and a capacity of 50, and its inbox is manually populated with three emails of sizes 10, 20, and 15 respectively.

The test method then calls receiver.clear_inbox(50). The clear_inbox method is designed to clear emails from the inbox until a specified size (in this case, 50) is freed up or the inbox is empty.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown of the clear_inbox method:
1. The method starts with freed_space initialized to 0.
2. It enters a while loop that continues as long as freed_space is less than the size parameter (50) and there are emails in the inbox.
3. In each iteration of the loop:
   - The first email in the inbox is removed.
   - The size of this email is added to freed_space.
4. This process repeats for each email:
   - First email: size 10, freed_space becomes 10.
   - Second email: size 20, freed_space becomes 30.
   - Third email: size 15, freed_space becomes 45.
5. After removing all emails, freed_space is 45, which is still less than 50, but the inbox is empty, so the loop exits.

The clear_inbox method does not have a return statement, so it implicitly returns None after clearing the inbox.
