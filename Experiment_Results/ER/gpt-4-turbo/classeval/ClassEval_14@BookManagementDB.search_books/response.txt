<<<Analysis>>>
The `Test.test()` method initializes a new instance of `BookManagementDB` with a database named "test.db". This triggers the `__init__` method in `BookManagementDB`, which connects to the SQLite database and creates a table named "books" if it doesn't already exist.

Next, three books are added to the database using the `add_book` method. Each book is inserted with a title, author, and an availability status set to 1 (available).

The `search_books` method is then called to retrieve all books from the database. This method executes a SELECT query to fetch all records from the "books" table and returns the result.

The test method returns a tuple containing:
1. The length of the books list, which should be 3 since three books were added.
2. The title of the first book, which is "Book 1".
3. The author of the second book, which is "Author 2".
4. The availability status of the third book, which is 1 (available).

<<<Output>>>
(3, 'Book 1', 'Author 2', 1)
