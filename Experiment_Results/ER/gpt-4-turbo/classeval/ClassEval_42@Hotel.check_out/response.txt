<<<Analysis>>>
The `Test.test()` method initializes a `Hotel` object with the name 'Test Hotel' and a dictionary of available rooms: {'single': 3, 'double': 2}. The `booked_rooms` attribute is then manually set to {'single': {'guest 1': 2}, 'double': {'guest 2': 1}}.

The `check_out` method is called with arguments 'triple' and 2. This method checks if the room type 'triple' exists in the `available_rooms` dictionary. Since 'triple' does not exist, it is added to the dictionary with a value of 2 rooms.

Finally, the method returns the current state of `available_rooms` and `booked_rooms`. The `available_rooms` will now include the 'triple' room type with 2 rooms, in addition to the initial 'single' and 'double' rooms. The `booked_rooms` remain unchanged from the manual setting.

<<<Output>>>
({'single': 3, 'double': 2, 'triple': 2}, {'single': {'guest 1': 2}, 'double': {'guest 2': 1}})
