<<<Analysis>>>
The `Test.test()` method initializes an instance of the `SplitSentence` class and calls the `process_text_file()` method with the input string "Mr. Smith is a teacher. Yes 1 2 3 4 5 6.".

1. Inside `process_text_file()`, the method `split_sentences()` is called with the input string. This method uses a regular expression to split the input string into sentences. The regex pattern used aims to split on periods or question marks that are followed by whitespace, but it avoids splitting on abbreviations or initials. The input string is split into two sentences: ["Mr. Smith is a teacher", "Yes 1 2 3 4 5 6"].

2. The method then iterates over each sentence to count the words using `count_words()`. This method first removes any non-alphabetic characters (excluding spaces) from the sentence using another regex, and then splits the cleaned sentence into words based on whitespace.

   - For "Mr. Smith is a teacher", after cleaning, it remains "Mr Smith is a teacher". Splitting this gives 5 words.
   - For "Yes 1 2 3 4 5 6", after cleaning, it becomes "Yes". Splitting this gives 1 word.

3. The method `process_text_file()` keeps track of the maximum word count found in any sentence, which in this case is 5 from the first sentence.

Finally, the method returns the maximum word count, which is 5.
