<<<Analysis>>>
In the `test()` method of the `Test` class, an instance of `CalendarUtil` is created. The `events` attribute of this instance is then manually set to contain a list with one event. This event is scheduled for January 1, 2023, from 1:00 AM to 2:00 AM, with a description of 'New Year'.

The `get_upcoming_events()` method of the `CalendarUtil` class is then called with an argument of 1, indicating that it should return up to 1 upcoming event.

Inside `get_upcoming_events()`, the current datetime is obtained using `datetime.now()`. The method then iterates through the `events` list to find events where the `start_time` is greater than or equal to the current datetime. If such an event is found, it is added to the `upcoming_events` list. This process stops either when the number of requested events (in this case, 1) is reached or when all events have been checked.

Given that the event on January 1, 2023, is likely to be in the future relative to the current datetime (assuming the current date is before this event), this event will be identified as an upcoming event and returned in a list.
