<<<Analysis>>>
The `Test.test()` method in the provided code performs several operations using the `AccessGatewayFilter` class. Let's break down each step:

1. **Instantiation of AccessGatewayFilter**:
   - An instance of `AccessGatewayFilter` is created.

2. **First filter method call**:
   - The `filter` method is called with a request dictionary `{'path': '/api/data', 'method': 'GET'}`.
   - Inside `filter`, it checks if the request URI starts with specific paths using `is_start_with`. Since '/api/data' starts with '/api', `is_start_with` returns `True`.
   - The `filter` method then returns `True` immediately without proceeding to check the JWT token.

3. **is_start_with method call**:
   - Directly calls `is_start_with` with the URI '/api/data'.
   - Similar to the previous call within `filter`, this returns `True`.

4. **get_jwt_user method call**:
   - The `get_jwt_user` method is called with a modified request dictionary that includes a JWT token constructed with today's date appended to 'user1'.
   - Inside `get_jwt_user`, it extracts the token and checks if the JWT starts with the username ('user1'), which it does.
   - It then attempts to parse the date from the JWT. Since the date is today's date, the difference between today and the JWT date is 0 days.
   - Since the difference is not greater than or equal to 3 days, it returns the token dictionary.

The `test` method returns the results of the three calls as a tuple. The first two calls to `filter` and `is_start_with` both return `True`, and the third call to `get_jwt_user` returns the token dictionary.

<<<Output>>>
(True, True, {'user': {'name': 'user1'}, 'jwt': 'user1' + str(datetime.date.today())})
