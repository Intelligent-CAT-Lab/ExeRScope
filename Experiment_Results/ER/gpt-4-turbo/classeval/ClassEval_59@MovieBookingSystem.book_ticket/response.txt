<<<Analysis>>>
The `Test.test()` method performs the following operations:
1. An instance of `MovieBookingSystem` is created.
2. A movie named 'Batman' is added with a price of 49.9, a start time of '17:05', an end time of '19:25', and a 3x3 seating arrangement.
3. The `book_ticket` method is called to book a ticket for 'Batman' at seat (0, 0). Since the seat is initially unoccupied (value 0), it is set to 1, indicating the seat is now booked, and "Booking success." is returned.
4. The `book_ticket` method is called again to book the same seat (0, 0) for 'Batman'. This time, since the seat is already booked (value 1), "Booking failed." is returned.
5. The method returns a tuple containing the result of the second booking attempt ("Booking failed.") and the current state of the seat (0, 0), which is 1 (booked).

<<<Output>>>
("Booking failed.", 1)
