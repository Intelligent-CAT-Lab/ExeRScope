<<<Analysis>>>
In the `test()` method of the `Test` class, the following steps are executed:

1. An instance of `ImageProcessor` is created.
2. A new image file "test.png" is created using PIL's `Image.new()` method with RGB mode, dimensions 100x100, and a white color (255, 255, 255).
3. This image is saved to a path derived from the current file's directory.
4. The `load_image()` method of the `ImageProcessor` instance is called with the path to the newly created image.
5. The `load_image()` method uses PIL's `Image.open()` to load the image from the specified path into the `ImageProcessor` instance.
6. The format of the image is then returned by accessing `self.processor.image.format`.

Since the image was created and saved using PIL's `Image.new()` and `save()` methods, the format of the image should be "PNG" because it was saved with a ".png" extension and PIL recognizes and handles the format based on the file extension.

PNG
