<<<Analysis>>>
In the `test()` method of the `Test` class, an instance of `CookiesUtil` is created with the filename 'cookies.json'. The `cookies` attribute of this instance is then manually set to a dictionary containing another dictionary under the key 'cookies'. This setup, however, does not affect the file 'cookies.json' because the `_save_cookies()` method, which writes to the file, is not called after setting the `cookies` attribute.

The `load_cookies()` method is then called. This method attempts to open and read a file named 'cookies.json'. Since the file handling is wrapped in a try-except block, if the file does not exist (which is the likely scenario given the information provided), the method will catch a `FileNotFoundError` and return an empty dictionary `{}`.

Therefore, the expected output of the `test()` method is an empty dictionary, as the file 'cookies.json' does not exist and no write operation is performed to create or modify it within the scope of the provided code and test method.
