<<<Analysis>>>
The `test()` method in the `Test` class creates an instance of `RegexUtils` and then calls the `findall()` method with a regex pattern and a text string. The regex pattern used is `r'\b\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}\b'`, which is designed to find sequences that match the format of a U.S. phone number (three digits, a hyphen, three digits, a hyphen, and four digits).

The `findall()` method of the `RegexUtils` class uses Python's `re.findall()` function, which returns all non-overlapping matches of the pattern in the string as a list of strings.

The input text string is `"abiguygusu  111-111-1111 kjgufwycs 987-762-9767"`. The regex pattern will match two phone numbers in this string:
1. "111-111-1111"
2. "987-762-9767"

Thus, the `findall()` method will return a list containing these two matched strings.
<<<Output>>>
['111-111-1111', '987-762-9767']
