<<<Analysis>>>
In the provided code, the `Test.test()` method creates an instance of the `Server` class and then attempts to delete an address (22) from the server's white list using the `del_white_list` method.

1. The `Server` class is initialized with an empty `white_list` list.
2. The `del_white_list` method is called with the address 22.
3. Inside `del_white_list`, it first checks if the address 22 is in the `white_list`. Since the `white_list` was initialized as empty and no addresses were added before this method call, 22 is not in the `white_list`.
4. As a result, the method returns `False` because the address was not found in the `white_list`.

Thus, the output of the `Test.test()` method will be `False`.

<<<Output>>>
False
