The `Test.test()` method creates an instance of `EncryptionUtils` with the key "longkey" and then calls the `rail_fence_cipher` method with the plaintext 'AbCdEfG' and 2 rails.

The `rail_fence_cipher` method works as follows:
1. It initializes a 2D list `fence` with dimensions given by `rails` (2) and the length of `plain_text` (7). Each element is initialized to '\n'.
2. It uses variables `row` and `col` to navigate through the `fence`. The `direction` variable helps in zigzagging through the rows. Initially, `row` is 0, `col` is 0, and `direction` is -1.
3. As it iterates through each character in `plain_text`:
   - If `row` is at the top (0) or the bottom (`rails-1`), it changes the direction.
   - It places the character in the current `row` and `col`, then increments `col` by 1 and adjusts `row` by `direction`.
4. After filling the `fence`, it constructs the `encrypted_text` by reading characters row-wise, skipping the '\n' characters.

For the input 'AbCdEfG' with 2 rails, the `fence` would look like:
- Row 0: A, C, E, G
- Row 1: B, D, F

The final encrypted text is constructed by reading characters from each row, resulting in "ACEGBDF".
