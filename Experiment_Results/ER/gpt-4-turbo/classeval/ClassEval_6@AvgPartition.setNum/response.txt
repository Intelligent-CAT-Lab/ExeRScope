<<<Analysis>>>
The `Test.test()` method creates an instance of the `AvgPartition` class with a list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and a limit of `2`. The `setNum()` method of the `AvgPartition` class is then called on this instance.

Inside the `setNum()` method:
- The `size` is calculated as the integer division of the length of the list by the limit, which is `5 // 2 = 2`.
- The `remainder` is calculated as the modulus of the length of the list by the limit, which is `5 % 2 = 1`.

Thus, the method returns a tuple `(size, remainder)` which is `(2, 1)`.

<<<Output>>>
(2, 1)
