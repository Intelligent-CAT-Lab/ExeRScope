The `Test.test()` method performs several operations involving XML processing:
1. A temporary XML file named 'test.xml' is created and written with a simple XML structure containing a root element and a single child item element with the text 'apple'.
2. An instance of `XMLProcessor` is created with 'test.xml' as the file to process.
3. The XML file is parsed and its root is manually set to the processor's root attribute.
4. The `read_xml()` method of `XMLProcessor` is called, which attempts to parse the XML file again and set the root element of the parsed tree to the processor's root attribute. This method returns the root element of the XML document.
5. The `findall()` method is used on the root element to find all elements with the tag 'item'.
6. The temporary XML file 'test.xml' is deleted.
7. The method returns a tuple containing the root element and the text of the first 'item' element found.

The expected output is the root element of the XML and the text of the first 'item' element, which is 'apple'.

<<<Output>>>
(<Element 'root' at 0xADDRESS>, 'apple')
