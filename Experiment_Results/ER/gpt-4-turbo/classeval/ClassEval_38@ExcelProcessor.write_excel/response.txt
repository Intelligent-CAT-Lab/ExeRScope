<<<Analysis>>>
In the `test()` method of the `Test` class, an instance of `ExcelProcessor` is created. The method then defines a list `new_data` containing tuples that represent rows of an Excel file. The `save_file_name` is set to an empty string.

The `write_excel()` method of `ExcelProcessor` is called with `new_data` and `save_file_name` as arguments. Inside `write_excel()`, the method attempts to create and save an Excel workbook using the `openpyxl` library.

The `workbook.save(file_name)` function requires a valid file name to save the Excel file. Since `save_file_name` is an empty string, this operation will fail, and the method will catch the exception and return 0.

Thus, the `test()` method will return 0, indicating that the write operation was unsuccessful due to an invalid file name.
