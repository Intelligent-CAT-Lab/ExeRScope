The `Test.test()` method initializes an instance of `MetricsCalculator` and then calls the `recall` method with two lists of predicted and true labels. The `recall` method is designed to calculate the recall metric, which is the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false negatives.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown:
1. An instance of `MetricsCalculator` is created, initializing `true_positives`, `false_positives`, `false_negatives`, and `true_negatives` to 0.
2. The `recall` method is called with `predicted_labels=[1, 1, 0, 1]` and `true_labels=[1, 0, 0, 1]`.
3. Inside `recall`, the `update` method is called to update the metrics based on the input labels:
   - Comparing the first elements: predicted=1, true=1 (true positive)
   - Comparing the second elements: predicted=1, true=0 (false positive)
   - Comparing the third elements: predicted=0, true=0 (true negative)
   - Comparing the fourth elements: predicted=1, true=1 (true positive)
   After this, `true_positives=2`, `false_positives=1`, `false_negatives=0`, `true_negatives=1`.
4. The recall is then calculated as `true_positives / (true_positives + false_negatives) = 2 / (2 + 0) = 1.0`.

Thus, the recall value calculated is 1.0.
