<<<Analysis>>>
In the `test()` method of the `Test` class, an instance of `ArrangementCalculator` is created with the list `[1, 2]` as its `datas` attribute. The `select()` method of this instance is then called without specifying the parameter `m`, which defaults to the length of `datas` (which is 2 in this case).

The `select()` method uses `itertools.permutations` to generate all permutations of the list `[1, 2]` with length 2. The permutations generated by `itertools.permutations` for `[1, 2]` are `(1, 2)` and `(2, 1)`. These tuples are then converted to lists and added to the `result` list.

Thus, the `result` list after processing will contain `[[1, 2], [2, 1]]`.

The `test()` method returns a tuple containing the `result` from the `select()` method and the `expected` list `[[1, 2], [2, 1]]`.

<<<Output>>>
([[1, 2], [2, 1]], [[1, 2], [2, 1]])
