<<<Analysis>>>
The `Test.test()` method in the provided code performs several operations involving reading and writing to a DOCX file using the `DocFileHandler` class and the `python-docx` library.

1. A `DocFileHandler` object is instantiated with the file path "test_example.docx".
2. A new DOCX document is created and a paragraph with the text "aaa\nbbb" is added. However, the newline character `\n` does not create a new paragraph in DOCX files; it is treated as a regular character. Therefore, the text "aaa\nbbb" is added as a single line in the paragraph.
3. The document is saved to "test_example.docx".
4. The `read_text()` method of `DocFileHandler` is called, which reads the text from the document. It iterates over paragraphs in the document. Since the text "aaa\nbbb" was added as a single paragraph, it will be read as one line.
5. The method returns the text content read from the file and the expected content "aaa\nbbb".
6. The file is then deleted if it exists.

The expected behavior is that the text read from the file will be "aaa\nbbb" as a single string without any new lines, matching the expected content.

<<<Output>>>
("aaa\nbbb", "aaa\nbbb")
