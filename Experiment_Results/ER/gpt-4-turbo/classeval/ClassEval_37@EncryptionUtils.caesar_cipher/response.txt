The `test()` method in the `Test` class creates an instance of `EncryptionUtils` with the key "key". It then calls the `caesar_cipher` method on the plaintext 'abcxyz' with a shift of 27.

The `caesar_cipher` method processes each character in the plaintext:
1. For each character, it checks if it is an alphabetic character.
2. It determines the ASCII offset based on whether the character is uppercase (65 for 'A' to 'Z') or lowercase (97 for 'a' to 'z').
3. It calculates the new character by shifting the current character's ASCII value by the shift amount, wrapping around within the alphabet using modulo 26, and then adjusting back using the ASCII offset.
4. The shift of 27 is effectively a shift of 1 (since 27 % 26 = 1), meaning each letter is moved to the next letter in the alphabet.

Step-by-step transformation:
- 'a' -> 'b'
- 'b' -> 'c'
- 'c' -> 'd'
- 'x' -> 'y'
- 'y' -> 'z'
- 'z' -> 'a'

Thus, the output ciphertext for the input 'abcxyz' with a shift of 27 is 'bcdyza'.
