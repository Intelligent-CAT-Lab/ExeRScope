The `Test.test()` method creates an instance of `CombinationCalculator` with the list `["A", "B"]`. It then calls the `select_all()` method on this instance.

The `select_all()` method initializes an empty list `result` and iterates over the range from 1 to the length of `datas` plus 1. For each iteration, it calls the `select(m)` method where `m` is the current iteration value.

The `select(m)` method initializes an empty list `result` and calls the `_select()` method with initial parameters: `dataIndex=0`, `resultList` initialized with `m` `None` values, `resultIndex=0`, and the empty `result` list.

The `_select()` method is a recursive function designed to generate all combinations of the elements in `datas` of length `m`. It uses the parameters `dataIndex` to track the current index in `datas`, `resultList` to store the current combination, `resultIndex` to track the current position in `resultList`, and `result` to collect all valid combinations.

For `m=1`, the `_select()` method will generate combinations of length 1:
- First, it places "A" at index 0 of `resultList` and recurses, which leads to adding `["A"]` to `result`.
- Next, it places "B" at index 0 of `resultList` and recurses, which leads to adding `["B"]` to `result`.

For `m=2`, the `_select()` method will generate combinations of length 2:
- It starts with "A" at index 0, then places "B" at index 1, and recurses, which leads to adding `["A", "B"]` to `result`.

The `select_all()` method collects all these results into a single list and returns it.

[['A'], ['B'], ['A', 'B']]
