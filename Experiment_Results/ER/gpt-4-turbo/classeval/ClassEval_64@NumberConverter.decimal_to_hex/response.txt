<<<Analysis>>>
The `test()` method in the `Test` class calls the `NumberConverter.decimal_to_hex(84907)` method. This method is designed to convert a decimal number to its hexadecimal representation.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown:
1. The input decimal number is 84907.
2. The `decimal_to_hex` method uses Python's built-in `hex()` function to convert the decimal number to a hexadecimal string. The `hex()` function returns the hexadecimal string prefixed with "0x".
3. The method then slices the string to remove the "0x" prefix using `[2:]`, resulting in just the hexadecimal number as a string.
4. The hexadecimal representation of 84907 is calculated by `hex(84907)` which results in '0x14b3b'. After slicing off '0x', the result is '14b3b'.

<<<Output>>>
14b3b
