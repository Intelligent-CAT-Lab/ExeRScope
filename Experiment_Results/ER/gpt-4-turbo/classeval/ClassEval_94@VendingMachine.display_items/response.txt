<<<Analysis>>>
In the test() method, an instance of VendingMachine is created. The inventory of the vending machine is manually set to contain two items: 'Coke' with a price of $1.25 and a quantity of 0, and 'Pizza' with a price of $1.25 and a quantity of 10.

The display_items() method of the VendingMachine class is then called. This method checks if the inventory is empty. If it is, it returns False. Otherwise, it iterates over the items in the inventory, formatting each item's name, price, and quantity into a string in the format "item_name - $price [quantity]". These strings are collected into a list.

In this case, the inventory is not empty, so the method proceeds to format the inventory items:
- For 'Coke', the formatted string is "Coke - $1.25 [0]"
- For 'Pizza', the formatted string is "Pizza - $1.25 [10]"

These strings are then joined with a newline character and returned as the final output.

<<<Output>>>
Coke - $1.25 [0]
Pizza - $1.25 [10]
