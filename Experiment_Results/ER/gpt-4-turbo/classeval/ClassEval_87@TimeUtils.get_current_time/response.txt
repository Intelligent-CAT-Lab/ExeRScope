<<<Analysis>>>
The `Test.test()` method in the provided code initializes an instance of the `TimeUtils` class and then calls two methods to get the current time in the format "%H:%M:%S".

1. `timeutils = TimeUtils()` - This line creates an instance of `TimeUtils`. During the initialization (`__init__`), `self.datetime` is set to the current date and time at the moment of the object's creation.

2. `timeutils.get_current_time()` - This method formats `self.datetime` (which was set during the initialization of the object) to a string representing the current time in the format "%H:%M:%S".

3. `timeutils.datetime.strftime('%H:%M:%S')` - This line directly formats the `self.datetime` attribute of the `timeutils` object to the same time format "%H:%M:%S".

Since both `get_current_time()` and the direct `strftime` call on `self.datetime` use the same datetime object (`self.datetime`) and format it in the same way ("%H:%M:%S"), both will return the exact same string representation of the time, assuming no significant time delay occurs between the two calls.

<<<Output>>>
("HH:MM:SS", "HH:MM:SS")  # where "HH:MM:SS" represents the current time at the moment of object creation, formatted as hours, minutes, and seconds.
