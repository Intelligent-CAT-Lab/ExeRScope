<<<Analysis>>>
The `Test.test()` method initializes an instance of `StockPortfolioTracker` with a cash balance of 10000.0. The portfolio is then manually set to contain one stock entry for 'AAPL' with a price of 150.0 and a quantity of 20.

The `sell_stock()` method is called with the stock details {'name': 'AAPL', 'price': 150.0, 'quantity': 20}. This method internally calls `remove_stock()` to check if the stock can be removed from the portfolio:
1. `remove_stock()` iterates through the portfolio and finds a match with the 'AAPL' stock.
2. It checks if the quantity to be removed (20) is less than or equal to the quantity in the portfolio (20), which is true.
3. The quantity of 'AAPL' stock is reduced by 20, resulting in a new quantity of 0. Since the quantity becomes 0, the stock entry is removed from the portfolio.
4. `remove_stock()` returns True, indicating the stock was successfully removed.

Back in `sell_stock()`, since `remove_stock()` returned True, the cash balance of the tracker is increased by the value of the sold stock (150.0 * 20 = 3000.0). The new cash balance becomes 10000.0 + 3000.0 = 13000.0.

Finally, `sell_stock()` returns True (indicating the stock was successfully sold), the updated portfolio (which is now empty), and the updated cash balance (13000.0).

<<<Output>>>
(True, [], 13000.0)
