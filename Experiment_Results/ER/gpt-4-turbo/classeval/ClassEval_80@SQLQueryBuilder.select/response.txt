<<<Analysis>>>
The `test()` method in the `Test` class calls the `select` method of the `SQLQueryBuilder` class with three arguments: the table name 'students', a list of columns `['id', 'name']`, and a dictionary representing a WHERE clause `{'age': 18}`.

1. Inside the `select` method:
   - The `columns` parameter is not '*', so it joins the list `['id', 'name']` into a string 'id, name'.
   - The `query` variable is constructed with the table name and the columns, resulting in "SELECT id, name FROM students".
   - Since a `where` clause is provided, it constructs the WHERE part of the SQL query. It iterates over the `where` dictionary, resulting in the string "age='18'".
   - This WHERE clause is appended to the `query`, resulting in the final SQL query: "SELECT id, name FROM students WHERE age='18'".

2. The method returns the constructed SQL query string.

<<<Output>>>
"SELECT id, name FROM students WHERE age='18'"
