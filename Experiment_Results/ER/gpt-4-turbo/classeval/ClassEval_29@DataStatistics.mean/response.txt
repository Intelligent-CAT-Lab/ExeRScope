<<<Analysis>>>
The `test()` method in the `Test` class creates an instance of the `DataStatistics` class and then calls the `mean()` method with the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` as an argument.

The `mean()` method calculates the mean of the provided data list:
1. It first calculates the sum of the list: \(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15\).
2. It then divides this sum by the length of the list, which is 5, resulting in \(15 / 5 = 3.0\).
3. The result is then rounded to two decimal places, which remains 3.0.

Thus, the method returns 3.0 as the mean of the list.

<<<Output>>>
3.0
