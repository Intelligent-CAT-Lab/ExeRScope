<<<Analysis>>>
In the test() method, an instance of the AssessmentSystem class is created. The students attribute of this instance is manually set to include a dictionary with one student, 'Alice', who has a grade, major, and a course with a score.

The method then calls get_gpa('Bob') on the assessment_system instance. The get_gpa method checks if the name 'Bob' exists in the students dictionary. Since 'Bob' is not present in the dictionary (only 'Alice' is), the method returns None.

<<<Output>>>
None
