<<<Analysis>>>
The `Test.test()` method initializes an instance of `ExpressionCalculator` and then calls the `transform` method with the expression "2 + 3 * 4". The `transform` method is designed to preprocess the expression for further calculation by removing spaces and handling negative signs.

1. The `transform` method first removes all spaces from the expression using `re.sub(r"\s+", "", expression)`, resulting in "2+3*4".
2. It then removes any trailing equals sign, which is not present in this case, so the expression remains "2+3*4".
3. The method converts the expression into a list of characters: ['2', '+', '3', '*', '4'].
4. It iterates over this list to handle negative signs. Specifically, it looks for '-' signs that should be treated as unary minus (indicating a negative number) rather than as subtraction. It replaces such '-' with '~'. However, in this expression, there are no '-' signs to be transformed.
5. Since there are no changes related to negative signs, the method returns the expression as a string "2+3*4".

Thus, the `transform` method processes the input "2 + 3 * 4" and returns it as "2+3*4" after removing spaces and checking for unary minus signs, which are not present in this case.

<<<Output>>>
"2+3*4"
