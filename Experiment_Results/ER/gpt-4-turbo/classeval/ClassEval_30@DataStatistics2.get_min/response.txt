<<<Analysis>>>
In the provided code, the `Test.test()` method creates an instance of the `DataStatistics2` class with the data `[-111, -1, -3, 2]`. This data is then converted into a numpy array within the class constructor.

The `test()` method calls the `get_min()` method of the `DataStatistics2` instance. The `get_min()` method utilizes the numpy function `np.min()` to find the minimum value in the numpy array. Given the array `[-111, -1, -3, 2]`, the minimum value is clearly `-111` as it is the smallest number in the list.

Thus, the `get_min()` method will return `-111`.

<<<Output>>>
-111
