<<<Analysis>>>
The `Test.test()` method creates an instance of the `SQLGenerator` class with the table name 'table1'. It then calls the `delete` method on this instance with a specific condition string: "field1 = value1 AND field2 = value2 AND field3 = value3 AND field4 = value4".

Inside the `delete` method:
1. The method constructs an SQL DELETE statement using the provided table name ('table1') and the condition.
2. The SQL statement is formed as "DELETE FROM table1 WHERE field1 = value1 AND field2 = value2 AND field3 = value3 AND field4 = value4".
3. A semicolon is appended to the end of the SQL statement to complete the syntax.

Finally, the complete SQL statement is returned from the `delete` method and subsequently from the `test` method.

<<<Output>>>
"DELETE FROM table1 WHERE field1 = value1 AND field2 = value2 AND field3 = value3 AND field4 = value4;"
