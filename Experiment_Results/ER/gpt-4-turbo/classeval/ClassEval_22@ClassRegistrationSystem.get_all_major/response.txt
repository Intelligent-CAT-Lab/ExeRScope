<<<Analysis>>>
In the `test()` method of the `Test` class, an instance of `ClassRegistrationSystem` is created. The `students` attribute of this instance is then manually populated with a list of dictionaries, each representing a student with their name and major.

The `get_all_major()` method of `ClassRegistrationSystem` is called next. This method initializes an empty list `major_list` and iterates over each student in the `students` list. For each student, it checks if the student's major is not already in `major_list`. If it's not, the major is appended to `major_list`.

Given the input students:
- John and Bob are from "Computer Science"
- Alice and Tom are from "Mathematics"
- Jerry is from "Physics"

The method should collect each unique major exactly once. Therefore, the expected output should be a list of majors in the order they appear in the `students` list, which are "Computer Science", "Mathematics", and "Physics".

<<<Output>>>
['Computer Science', 'Mathematics', 'Physics']
