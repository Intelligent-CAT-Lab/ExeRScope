<<<Analysis>>>
The `test()` method in the `Test` class creates an instance of `RegexUtils` and then calls the `split()` method on it. The `split()` method is used to split a string by the occurrences of a pattern. The pattern provided is `r'\b\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}\b'`, which matches strings that represent phone numbers in the format `xxx-xxx-xxxx` where `x` is a digit.

The input text for the split operation is `"123456-7890 abiguygusu 876-286-9876 kjgufwycs 987-762-9767"`. Here's how the `split()` method processes this input:
1. The pattern does not match "123456-7890" because it lacks the correct format.
2. The pattern matches "876-286-9876", so the text is split at this point.
3. The pattern matches "987-762-9767", so the text is split at this point as well.

The result of the split operation will be an array of strings that were separated by the matched patterns. The parts of the string that match the pattern are not included in the result array.

<<<Output>>>
['123456-7890 abiguygusu ', ' kjgufwycs ', '']
