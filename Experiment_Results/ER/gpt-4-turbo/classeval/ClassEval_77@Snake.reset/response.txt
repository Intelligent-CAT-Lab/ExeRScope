<<<Analysis>>>
The `Test.test()` method initializes a `Snake` object with the following parameters:
- SCREEN_WIDTH = 100
- SCREEN_HEIGHT = 100
- BLOCK_SIZE = 1
- food_position = (51, 51)

The initial state of the snake:
- length = 1
- positions = [(50, 50)] (center of the screen)
- score = 0

The `move((-1, 0))` method is called, which updates the snake's position based on the direction provided:
- The direction `(-1, 0)` means move left by 1 unit.
- The new position calculated will be (49, 50).

Since the new position (49, 50) is not equal to the food position (51, 51), the snake does not eat food, and its length remains 1. The positions list is updated to [(49, 50)].

Next, the `reset()` method is called:
- This resets the snake's length to 1.
- The positions list is reset to the center of the screen, which is [(50, 50)].
- The score is reset to 0.
- A new food position is randomly generated, but it does not affect the output of this test.

Finally, the test method returns:
- snake.length = 1
- snake.positions[0] = (50.0, 50.0) (as the center of the screen)
- snake.score = 0

<<<Output>>>
(1, (50.0, 50.0), 0)
