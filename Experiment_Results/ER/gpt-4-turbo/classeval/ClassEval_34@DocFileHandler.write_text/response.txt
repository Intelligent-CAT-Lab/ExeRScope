<<<Analysis>>>
The `Test.test()` method performs several operations involving reading and writing to a Word document using the `DocFileHandler` class.

1. A `DocFileHandler` object is instantiated with the file path "test_example.docx".
2. A new Word document is created and "Initial content" is added as a paragraph. This document is then saved to "test_example.docx".
3. The `write_text` method of `DocFileHandler` is called with "New content 1" as the content to be written. This method:
   - Creates a new document (not appending to the existing one, but overwriting it).
   - Adds a paragraph with "New content 1".
   - Saves the document to the same file path, overwriting the previous content.
4. The `read_text` method is then called to read the content of the document. Since the document was overwritten with only "New content 1", this is the only content present.
5. The method returns a tuple containing the text content read from the document and the new content string that was written.

The key point here is that the `write_text` method does not append to the document but overwrites it. Therefore, the only content in the document when `read_text` is called will be "New content 1".

<<<Output>>>
("New content 1", "New content 1")
