<<<Analysis>>>
The `test()` method in the `Test` class creates an instance of `RegexUtils` and then calls the `match()` method with a regex pattern designed to match phone numbers in the format "ddd-ddd-dddd" (where d represents a digit) and the text "1234567890".

The regex pattern used is `r'\b\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}\b'`. This pattern checks for a word boundary (`\b`), followed by three digits (`\d{3}`), a hyphen (`-`), another three digits, another hyphen, and finally four digits, ending with a word boundary.

The text "1234567890" does not match the pattern because it lacks the hyphens between the digits as required by the pattern. Therefore, the `re.match()` function, which is used inside the `match()` method of `RegexUtils`, will not find a match at the start of the string, and it will return `None`.

The `match()` method of `RegexUtils` checks if the result from `re.match()` is truthy. Since it is `None` (falsy), the method returns `False`.
