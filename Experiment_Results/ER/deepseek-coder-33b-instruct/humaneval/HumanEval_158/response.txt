The function `find_max` takes a list of strings as input.
The `sorted` function is used to sort the list of words. The `key` argument is a function that takes an element of the list and returns a value that will be used for sorting.
In this case, the key function is `lambda x: (-len(set(x)), x)`. This function takes a string `x`, converts it to a set to remove duplicates, takes the length of this set (which is the number of unique characters in the string), and negates this length (to sort in descending order of the number of unique characters). If two strings have the same number of unique characters, they are sorted in lexicographic order.
The `[0]` at the end of the sorted function call is used to get the first element of the sorted list, which is the string with the most unique characters.
In the case of `find_max(["name", "of", "string"])`, the sorted list would be `['string', 'name', 'of']`. The string 'string' has the most unique characters, so it is returned as the output.
