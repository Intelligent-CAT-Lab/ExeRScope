<<<Analysis>>>
The function factorize takes an integer n as input.
The function starts by importing the math module and initializing an empty list fact.
The function then initializes a variable i to 2.
The function then enters a while loop that continues until i is greater than the square root of n plus 1.
Inside the loop, the function checks if n is divisible by i. If it is, i is appended to the list fact and n is divided by i. If it is not, i is incremented by 1.
The loop continues until n is no longer divisible by i.
After the loop, if n is greater than 1, n is appended to the list fact.
Finally, the function returns the list fact.
