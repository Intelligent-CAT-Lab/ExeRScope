The variable n and p are initialized to 3 and 5, respectively.
The variable ret is initialized to 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates n times, meaning it will perform the operation 2 * ret % p n times.
In each iteration, it calculates 2 * ret and then takes the modulus of p.
The operation 2 * ret % p is equivalent to (2 * ret) mod p.
The operation is performed n times, where n is 3 in this case.
The values of ret after each iteration are:
- After the first iteration: ret = 2 * 1 = 2
- After the second iteration: ret = 2 * 2 = 4
- After the third iteration: ret = 2 * 4 = 8
The modulus operation is applied to each result, so the final result is (8 mod 5) = 3.
