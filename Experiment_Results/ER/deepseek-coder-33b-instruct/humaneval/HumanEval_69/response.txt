<<<Analysis>>>
The input list is [5, 5, 5, 5, 1].
The variable frq is initialized as a list of zeros with a length of max(lst) + 1, which is 6 in this case.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each element in the input list.
For each element i in the list, it increments the corresponding index in the frq list.
After the loop finishes, the frq list will be [0, 1, 0, 0, 4, 1].
This means that the number 1 appears once, the number 4 appears four times, and the number 5 appears five times.
The code then initializes ans to -1.
The code enters a loop that iterates over the frq list, starting from the second element (index 1).
For each element i in the frq list, it checks if the frequency of i is greater than or equal to i.
If it is, it updates ans to i.
In this case, the condition is met when i is 4 and 5.
After the loop finishes, the code returns ans, which is 5.
<<<Output>>>
5
