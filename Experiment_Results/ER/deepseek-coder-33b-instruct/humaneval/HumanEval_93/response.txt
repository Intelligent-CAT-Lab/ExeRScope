The function `encode` takes a string `message` as input.
The variable `vowels` is a string containing all the vowels (both lowercase and uppercase).
The variable `vowels_replace` is a dictionary that maps each vowel to its corresponding character that is two positions ahead in the ASCII table. For example, 'a' maps to 'c', 'e' maps to 'g', 'i' maps to 'k', 'o' maps to 'q', 'u' maps to 'w', 'A' maps to 'C', 'E' maps to 'G', 'I' maps to 'K', 'O' maps to 'Q', 'U' maps to 'W'.
The `message` is then converted to its swapcase version, which means all lowercase letters are converted to uppercase and vice versa.
The function then iterates over each character in the `message`. If the character is a vowel (i.e., it is in the `vowels` string), it is replaced with the corresponding character in the `vowels_replace` dictionary. Otherwise, the character is left unchanged.
The function finally returns the modified `message`.
