<<<Analysis>>>
The function get_odd_collatz takes an integer n as input. If n is even, it initializes an empty list odd_collatz. If n is odd, it initializes a list with n as the only element.
The function then enters a while loop that continues until n is no longer greater than 1.
Inside the loop, if n is even, it divides n by 2. If n is odd, it multiplies n by 3 and adds 1.
If the new value of n is odd, it is appended to the list odd_collatz.
After the loop finishes, the function returns the sorted version of odd_collatz.

For the input 14, the function first checks if 14 is even. It is not, so odd_collatz is initialized with [14].
Then it enters the loop. In the first iteration, 14 is odd, so it becomes 42. In the second iteration, 42 is even, so it becomes 21. In the third iteration, 21 is odd, so it becomes 64. In the fourth iteration, 64 is even, so it becomes 32. In the fifth iteration, 32 is even, so it becomes 16. In the sixth iteration, 16 is even, so it becomes 8. In the seventh iteration, 8 is even, so it becomes 4. In the eighth iteration, 4 is even, so it becomes 2. In the ninth iteration, 2 is even, so it becomes 1.
After the loop finishes, the function returns the sorted version of odd_collatz, which is [14, 42, 21, 64].

<<<Output>>>
[14, 42, 21, 64]
