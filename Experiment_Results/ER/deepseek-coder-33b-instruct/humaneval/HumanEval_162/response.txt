<<<Analysis>>>
The function `string_to_md5` takes a string as input and returns its MD5 hash.
The MD5 hash is a type of cryptographic hash function that produces a 128-bit (16-byte) hash value. It is often used to ensure data integrity.

The function first checks if the input string is not empty. If it is not empty, it proceeds to calculate the MD5 hash of the string.

The string is encoded to ASCII format using the `encode('ascii')` method. This is because the MD5 hash function only works with bytes, not with strings.

The `hashlib.md5()` function is then used to calculate the MD5 hash of the encoded string. The `hexdigest()` method is used to get the hexadecimal representation of the hash.

If the input string is empty, the function returns `None`.

The input 'Hello world' is not empty, so the function proceeds to calculate the MD5 hash of the string. The MD5 hash of 'Hello world' is '3e25960a79dbc69b674cd4ec67a72c62'.

<<<Output>>>
'3e25960a79dbc69b674cd4ec67a72c62'
