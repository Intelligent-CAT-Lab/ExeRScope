The function `fix_spaces` takes a string `text` as input. It initializes two variables `start` and `end` to 0, and an empty string `new_text`.
The function then enters a while loop that iterates over each character in the input string `text`.
For each character, it checks if it is a space. If it is, it increments the `end` variable.
If the character is not a space, it checks if the number of spaces between the current character and the previous character is greater than 2. If it is, it appends a "-" to `new_text`. If the number of spaces is greater than 0 but not greater than 2, it appends "_" for each space to `new_text`. It then appends the current character to `new_text`. It then updates `start` and `end` to the index of the current character plus one.
After the loop finishes, it checks if the number of spaces at the end of the string is greater than 2. If it is, it appends a "-" to `new_text`. If the number of spaces is greater than 0 but not greater than 2, it appends "_" for each space to `new_text`.
Finally, it returns `new_text`.
