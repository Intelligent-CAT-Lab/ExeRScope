<<<Analysis>>>
The function common takes two lists as input, l1 and l2. It initializes an empty set ret.
The function then iterates over each element e1 in l1 and for each e1, it iterates over each element e2 in l2.
If e1 is equal to e2, it adds e1 to the set ret. This means it checks for common elements in both lists.
After the two loops finish, it converts the set ret to a list, sorts it, and returns it.
In the given example, the common elements are 1, 5, and 653.
<<<Output>>>
[1, 5, 653]
