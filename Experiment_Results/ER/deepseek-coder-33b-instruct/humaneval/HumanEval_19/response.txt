<<<Analysis>>>
The function `sort_numbers` takes a string of numbers as input, where each number is represented as a word. The string is split into a list of words using the `split` method. The list comprehension `[x for x in numbers.split(' ') if x]` is used to filter out any empty strings that might be present in the list.

The `sorted` function is then used to sort the list of words. The `key` argument of the `sorted` function is a lambda function that takes a word and returns its corresponding value from the `value_map` dictionary. The `value_map` dictionary maps each word to its corresponding integer value.

Finally, the `join` method is used to convert the sorted list of words back into a string, with each word separated by a space.

When the function `sort_numbers` is called with the input `'five zero four seven nine eight'`, the function first splits the string into a list of words: `['five', 'zero', 'four', 'seven', 'nine', 'eight']`. It then sorts this list based on the corresponding integer values from the `value_map` dictionary: `['zero', 'four', 'five', 'eight', 'nine', 'seven']`. Finally, it joins the sorted list of words back into a string, with each word separated by a space, and returns the result: `'zero four five eight nine seven'`.

<<<Output>>>
'zero four five eight nine seven'
