<<<Analysis>>>
The function is_prime(n) checks if a number n is a prime number.
The function first checks if n is less than 2. If it is, the function returns False, because a prime number must be greater than 1.
Then, the function enters a loop that iterates from 2 to n - 1. For each number k in this range, the function checks if n is divisible by k. If n is divisible by k (i.e., the remainder of n divided by k is 0), the function returns False, because n is not a prime number.
If the function finishes the loop without finding any divisors of n, it returns True, because n is a prime number.
In the case of is_prime(6), the function checks if 6 is divisible by any number from 2 to 5. 6 is divisible by 2 and 3, so the function returns False, because 6 is not a prime number.
