The function `check_dict_case` takes a dictionary as input. In this case, the input is `{"p":"pineapple", "b":"banana"}`.

The function first checks if the dictionary is empty. If it is, it returns `False`.

If the dictionary is not empty, it initializes a variable `state` to `"start"`. This variable will keep track of whether the keys in the dictionary are all uppercase, all lowercase, or a mix of both.

The function then iterates over the keys in the dictionary. For each key, it checks if the key is a string. If it is not, it sets `state` to `"mixed"` and breaks out of the loop.

If `state` is `"start"`, it checks if the key is uppercase or lowercase. If it is, it sets `state` to `"upper"` or `"lower"`, respectively.

If `state` is `"upper"` or `"lower"`, it checks if the current key is the same case as the previous keys. If it is not, it sets `state` to `"mixed"` and breaks out of the loop.

If the loop finishes without setting `state` to `"mixed"`, it returns `True` if `state` is `"upper"` or `"lower"`, and `False` otherwise.

In this case, the keys are "p" and "b", which are both lowercase. Therefore, the function returns `True`.
