<<<Analysis>>>
The function triangle_area takes two parameters, a and h. a is the base of the triangle and h is the height of the triangle.
The function calculates the area of the triangle using the formula: area = 1/2 * base * height.
In this case, a is 5 and h is 3.
So, the function calculates the area as follows: area = 1/2 * 5 * 3 = 7.5
<<<Output>>>
7.5
