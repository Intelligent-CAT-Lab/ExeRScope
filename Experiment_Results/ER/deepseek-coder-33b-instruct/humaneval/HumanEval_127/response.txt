<<<Analysis>>>
The function `intersection` takes two intervals as input. The first interval is (1, 2) and the second interval is (2, 3).

The function `is_prime` checks if a number is prime. It returns False for 0, 1 and all numbers that can be divided by any number other than 1 and itself.

In the `intersection` function, the leftmost point of the intersection is calculated as the maximum of the leftmost points of the two intervals, which is 2. The rightmost point of the intersection is calculated as the minimum of the rightmost points of the two intervals, which is 2.

The length of the intersection is calculated as the difference between the rightmost and leftmost points, which is 0.

Since the length of the intersection is 0, the function `is_prime` returns False, and the function `intersection` returns "NO".

<<<Output>>>
"NO"
