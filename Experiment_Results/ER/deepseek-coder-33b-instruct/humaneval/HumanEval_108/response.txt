The function count_nums takes a list of integers as input.
The function digits_sum is defined inside count_nums and it takes an integer as input.
If the input integer is negative, it changes the sign of the integer and multiplies the first digit by -1.
The function then converts the integer into a list of digits, calculates the sum of the digits, and returns the sum.
The function count_nums then applies the digits_sum function to each element in the input list, and filters out the elements that are not positive.
Finally, it returns the count of the positive elements.
In the given example, the input list is [1, 1, 2, -2, 3, 4, 5].
The digits_sum function is applied to each element in the list:
1 -> 1
1 -> 1
2 -> 2
-2 -> -2 (changed to 2)
3 -> 3
4 -> 4
5 -> 5
The positive elements are [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5], so the count_nums function returns 6.
<<<Output>>>
6
