<<<Analysis>>>
The function `concatenate` takes a list of strings as input. In this case, the input is `['x', 'y', 'z']`.
The function uses the `join` method of the string class to concatenate all the strings in the list. The `join` method concatenates all the strings in the list into a single string, with the string on which the method is called as the separator. In this case, the separator is an empty string, so the strings are simply concatenated together.
The function returns the resulting string, which is 'xyz'.
<<<Output>>>
'xyz'
