The function `numerical_letter_grade` takes a list of grades as input. For each grade in the list, it checks the grade point average (gpa) and assigns a corresponding letter grade. The grades and their corresponding letter grades are as follows:

- 4.0: "A+"
- 3.7 - 4.0: "A"
- 3.3 - 3.7: "A-"
- 3.0 - 3.3: "B+"
- 2.7 - 3.0: "B"
- 2.3 - 2.7: "B-"
- 2.0 - 2.3: "C+"
- 1.7 - 2.0: "C"
- 1.3 - 1.7: "C-"
- 1.0 - 1.3: "D+"
- 0.7 - 1.0: "D"
- 0.0 - 0.7: "D-"
- 0.0: "E"

The input list is [4.0, 3, 1.7, 2, 3.5].

The function starts by initializing an empty list `letter_grade`. Then it iterates over each gpa in the input list. For each gpa, it checks the gpa and assigns the corresponding letter grade.

For the first gpa (4.0), it assigns "A+" to `letter_grade`.
For the second gpa (3), it assigns "A" to `letter_grade`.
For the third gpa (1.7), it assigns "C" to `letter_grade`.
For the fourth gpa (2), it assigns "B" to `letter_grade`.
For the fifth gpa (3.5), it assigns "A" to `letter_grade`.

So, the final `letter_grade` list is ["A+", "A", "C", "B", "A"].

<<<Output>>>
["A+", "A", "C", "B", "A"]
