The function `valid_date` takes a string `date` as input. It first removes any leading or trailing whitespace from the date string using the `strip` method.

Next, it splits the date string into three parts using the `split` method, using '-' as the separator. This results in three variables: `month`, `day`, and `year`.

Each of these variables is then converted to an integer using the `int` function.

The function then checks if the month is within the range 1 to 12. If it's not, the function immediately returns `False`.

Next, the function checks if the day is within the valid range for the given month. If the month is one of the months with 31 days (January, March, May, July, August, October, and December), the day must be between 1 and 31. If the month is one of the months with 30 days (April, June, September, and November), the day must be between 1 and 30. If the month is February, the day must be between 1 and 29. If the day is not within the valid range, the function immediately returns `False`.

If the date is valid according to these checks, the function returns `True`. If any error occurs during the execution of the function (for example, if the date string cannot be split into three parts, or if the parts cannot be converted to integers), the function catches the exception and returns `False`.

In the case of `valid_date('03-11-2000')`, the month is 3, which is a valid month, the day is 11, which is a valid day for any month, and the year is 2000, which is a valid year. Therefore, the function returns `True`.
