<<<Analysis>>>
The function mean_absolute_deviation takes a list of float numbers as input.
The mean of the numbers is calculated by summing all the numbers and dividing by the count of numbers. In this case, the mean is (1.0 + 2.0 + 3.0) / 3 = 2.0.
The function then calculates the mean absolute deviation by iterating over each number in the list, subtracting the mean from the number, taking the absolute value of the result, and summing all these values. The result is then divided by the count of numbers to get the mean absolute deviation.
In this case, the mean absolute deviation is (|1.0 - 2.0| + |2.0 - 2.0| + |3.0 - 2.0|) / 3 = 1.0.
<<<Output>>>
1.0
