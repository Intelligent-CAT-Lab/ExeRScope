<<<Analysis>>>
The input string '(()()) ((())) () ((())()())' is passed to the function `separate_paren_groups`.
The function initializes an empty list `result` to store the separated parentheses groups and an empty list `current_string` to store the current parentheses group.
The variable `current_depth` is initialized to 0 to keep track of the depth of the parentheses.
The function then iterates over each character `c` in the input string.
If `c` is an opening parenthesis '(', `current_depth` is incremented and `c` is appended to `current_string`.
If `c` is a closing parenthesis ')', `current_depth` is decremented and `c` is appended to `current_string`.
If `current_depth` becomes 0, it means we have completed a parentheses group. This group is then appended to `result` and `current_string` is cleared to start a new group.
After the loop finishes, the function returns `result` which contains all the separated parentheses groups.
<<<Output>>>
['(()())', '((()))', '()', '((())()())']
