The variable n is initialized to 5.
An empty list primes is created to store the prime numbers.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 2 to n (exclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 2 to 4.
For each number i in this range, it checks if it is a prime number.
A number is considered prime if it is only divisible by 1 and itself. The code checks this by iterating from 2 to i (exclusive) and checking if i is divisible by any of these numbers. If it is, it sets is_prime to False and breaks the loop.
If is_prime is still True after the loop, it means i is a prime number and it is appended to the primes list.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the primes list, which contains the prime numbers from 2 to 4.
<<<Output>>>
[2, 3]
