<<<Analysis>>>
The input to the function is a list [1, 2, 3].
The function first separates the even and odd indexed elements into two different lists, evens and odds.
In this case, evens = [1] and odds = [2, 3].
Then it sorts the evens list in ascending order.
After that, it creates a new list ans and appends elements from evens and odds in an alternating manner.
In this case, ans = [1, 2, 3].
Finally, if the length of evens is more than the length of odds, it appends the last element of evens to ans.
In this case, the length of evens is equal to the length of odds, so no element is appended.
The function returns ans as a tuple.
<<<Output>>>
(1, 2, 3)
