<<<Analysis>>>
The input list ["aa", "a", "aaa"] is passed to the function sorted_list_sum.
The function first sorts the list in place, so the list becomes ["a", "aa", "aaa"].
Then it initializes an empty list new_lst.
The function then iterates over each element in the sorted list.
For each element, it checks if the length of the element is even. If it is, it appends the element to new_lst.
In this case, "a" and "aaa" are appended to new_lst.
Finally, the function returns a sorted version of new_lst, sorted by the length of the elements.
In this case, ["a", "aaa"] is returned.
<<<Output>>>
["a", "aaa"]
