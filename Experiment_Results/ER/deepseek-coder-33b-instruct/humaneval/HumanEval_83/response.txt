<<<Analysis>>>
The function starts_one_ends takes an integer n as input.
If n equals 1, the function returns 1.
If n is not equal to 1, the function returns 18 times 10 to the power of (n - 2).
In this case, n is 1, so the function returns 18 times 10 to the power of (1 - 2).
This simplifies to 18 times 10 to the power of -1, which equals 1.8.
However, since the function is supposed to return an integer, it rounds down to 1.
