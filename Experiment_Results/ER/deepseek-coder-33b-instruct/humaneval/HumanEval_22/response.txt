<<<Analysis>>>
The function filter_integers takes a list of any type of values as input. It uses a list comprehension to iterate over each value in the input list.
For each value, it checks if the value is an instance of the int class using the isinstance function. If the value is an integer, it is included in the output list.
In the given example, the input list is [3, 'c', 3, 3, 'a', 'b']. The function will return a new list that includes only the integers from the input list.
The integers in the input list are 3, 3, 3. So, the output list will be [3, 3, 3].
<<<Output>>>
[3, 3, 3]
