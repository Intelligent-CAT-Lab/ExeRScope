<<<Analysis>>>
The function `remove_vowels` takes a string `text` as input.
The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each character in the string.
For each character, it checks if the lowercase version of the character is not in the list of vowels (i.e., ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"]).
If the character is not a vowel, it is included in the new string that is being built.
The `join` method is used to concatenate all the non-vowel characters into a single string.
The function returns this new string.

In the case of `remove_vowels('fedcba')`, the function iterates over each character in the string 'fedcba'.
The characters 'e', 'd', 'c', 'b' are not vowels, so they are included in the new string.
The characters 'f', 'a' are vowels, so they are not included in the new string.
Therefore, the function returns the string 'fdcba'.

<<<Output>>>
'fdcba'
