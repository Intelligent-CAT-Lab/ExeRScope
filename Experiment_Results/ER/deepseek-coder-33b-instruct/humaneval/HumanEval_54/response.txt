<<<Analysis>>>
The function `same_chars` takes two strings as input, `s0` and `s1`.
The function converts each string into a set of characters. A set in Python is an unordered collection of unique elements. By converting the strings into sets, we effectively remove any duplicate characters and order of characters in the strings is not preserved.
In the case of `same_chars('eabcdzzzz', 'dddzzzzzzzddeddabc')`, the sets would be `{'e', 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'z'}` and `{'e', 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'z'}` respectively.
The function then compares these two sets. If they are equal, it means that both strings contain the exact same characters (possibly in different quantities). If they are not equal, it means that the strings contain different characters.
In this case, the sets are equal, so the function returns `True`.
