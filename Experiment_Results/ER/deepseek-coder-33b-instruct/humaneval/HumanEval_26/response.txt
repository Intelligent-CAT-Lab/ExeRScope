The function `remove_duplicates` takes a list of integers as input. It first imports the `collections` module, which provides a `Counter` class that can count the frequency of elements in a list.

In the function, it creates a `Counter` object `c` from the input list `numbers`. The `Counter` object `c` will contain the frequency of each number in the input list.

Then, it uses a list comprehension to create a new list. For each number `n` in the input list `numbers`, it checks if the count of `n` in `c` is less than or equal to 1. If it is, it includes `n` in the new list.

In the given example, the input list is `[1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 3, 5]`. The `Counter` object `c` will contain the counts of each number in the list: `c[1] = 1`, `c[2] = 2`, `c[3] = 2`, `c[4] = 1`, and `c[5] = 1`.

The list comprehension will include `n` in the new list if `c[n]` is less than or equal to 1. Therefore, the numbers 1, 4, and 5 will be included in the new list, because their counts in `c` are 1.

The output of the function will be the new list: `[1, 4, 5]`.
