<<<Analysis>>>
The function `skjkasdkd` takes a list of integers as input. It first defines a helper function `isPrime` to check if a number is prime.

The function then initializes `maxx` to 0 and `i` to 0. It enters a while loop that iterates over the list. For each element in the list, it checks if the element is greater than `maxx` and if it is a prime number. If both conditions are met, it updates `maxx` to the current element.

After the loop finishes, the function calculates the sum of the digits of `maxx`. It converts `maxx` to a string, iterates over each digit, converts it back to an integer, and adds it to the sum.

In the given list, the largest prime number is 181. The sum of its digits is 1 + 8 + 1 = 10.

<<<Output>>>
10
