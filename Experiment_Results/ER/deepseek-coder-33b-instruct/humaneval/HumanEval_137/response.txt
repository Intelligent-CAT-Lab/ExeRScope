<<<Analysis>>>
The function `compare_one` takes two arguments, `a` and `b`. It first creates copies of `a` and `b` and stores them in `temp_a` and `temp_b`.
If `temp_a` or `temp_b` is a string, it replaces any commas in the string with periods. This is done because Python's `float` function cannot parse strings with commas as decimal points.
Next, it checks if the floating point representation of `temp_a` is equal to the floating point representation of `temp_b`. If they are equal, the function returns `None`.
If they are not equal, the function returns `a` if the floating point representation of `temp_a` is greater than the floating point representation of `temp_b`, otherwise it returns `b`.
In this case, `a` is 1 and `b` is 2. The floating point representation of 1 is 1.0 and the floating point representation of 2 is 2.0. Since 1.0 is not equal to 2.0, the function returns `b`, which is 2.
