<<<Analysis>>>
The function fib takes an integer n as input.
The function first checks if n is 0. If it is, it returns 0.
If n is not 0, it then checks if n is 1. If it is, it returns 1.
If n is neither 0 nor 1, it then calls itself recursively twice: once with n - 1 and once with n - 2.
The function then returns the sum of the two recursive calls.
This is the definition of the Fibonacci sequence, where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1.
The function will keep calling itself recursively until it reaches the base cases (n = 0 or n = 1), at which point it will start returning values.
The function will return the 10th number in the Fibonacci sequence, which is 55.

55
