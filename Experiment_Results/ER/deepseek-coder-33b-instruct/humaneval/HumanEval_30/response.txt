<<<Analysis>>>
The function get_positive takes a list as input. The list is [-1, -2, 4, 5, 6].
The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each element in the list. For each element, it checks if the element is greater than 0. If it is, it includes the element in the new list.
In this case, the elements that are greater than 0 are 4, 5, and 6.
So, the function returns the list [4, 5, 6].
<<<Output>>>
[4, 5, 6]
