<<<Analysis>>>
The function is_equal_to_sum_even takes an integer n as input.
The function checks if the number is even by using the modulus operator (%). If the remainder of n divided by 2 is 0, it means the number is even.
The function then checks if the number is greater than or equal to 8.
If both conditions are met, the function returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.
In the case of is_equal_to_sum_even(4), the number 4 is not even (since 4%2 equals 0), so the function returns False.
<<<Output>>>
False
