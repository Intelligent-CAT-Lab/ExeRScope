<<<Analysis>>>
The function `sort_third` takes a list as input. The list is copied to a new list `l`. Then, the elements at every third position in `l` are sorted in ascending order. The sorted list is then returned.

In the given example, the input list is [1, 2, 3]. The elements at every third position in this list are 1 and 3. After sorting, the list becomes [1, 2, 3].

The function then returns the sorted list [1, 2, 3].

<<<Output>>>
[1, 2, 3]
