The function sum_squares takes a list of numbers as input. The list is [1,2,3].
The function first imports the math module, which provides mathematical functions.
The variable squared is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of squares.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each element i in the list.
For each element i in the list, it calculates the square of the ceiling of i (the smallest integer greater than or equal to i) and adds it to squared.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of squared, which is 14.
<<<Output>>>
14
