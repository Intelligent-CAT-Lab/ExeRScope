<<<Analysis>>>
The function `double_the_difference` takes a list `lst` as input.
The list comprehension `[i**2 for i in lst if i > 0 and i%2!=0 and "." not in str(i)]` generates a new list that includes the square of each number in `lst` that is both positive, odd, and does not contain a decimal point.
The `sum` function then adds up all the numbers in this new list, and the result is returned by the function.
In the given example, the list `lst` is `[0.2, 3, 5]`.
The list comprehension generates a new list `[25]`, because 3 and 5 are both positive, odd, and do not contain a decimal point.
The `sum` function then adds up all the numbers in this new list, resulting in `25`.
<<<Output>>>
25
