<<<Analysis>>>
The function decimal_to_binary takes an integer as input. In this case, the input is 0.
The function then converts this integer to its binary representation using the built-in bin function in Python. The bin function returns a string that starts with "0b" to indicate that it's a binary number, so we use string slicing to remove the first two characters.
The function then adds "db" to the beginning and end of the binary string, and returns the result.
<<<Output>>>
"db0db"
