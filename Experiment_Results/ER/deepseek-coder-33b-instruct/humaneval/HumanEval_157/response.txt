<<<Analysis>>>
The function right_angle_triangle takes three arguments: a, b, and c. These are the lengths of the sides of a triangle.
The function returns True if any of the following conditions are met:
1. a*a == b*b + c*c
2. b*b == a*a + c*c
3. c*c == a*a + b*b

In the given example, a=3, b=4, and c=5.

The first condition is not met because 3*3 is not equal to 4*4 + 5*5.
The second condition is not met because 4*4 is not equal to 3*3 + 5*5.
The third condition is met because 5*5 is equal to 3*3 + 4*4.

So, the function returns True.

<<<Output>>>
True
