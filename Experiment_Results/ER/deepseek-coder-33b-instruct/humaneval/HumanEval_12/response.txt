<<<Analysis>>>
The function `longest` takes a list of strings as input. In this case, the input is `['x', 'yyy', 'zzzz', 'www', 'kkkk', 'abc']`.

The function first checks if the list is empty. If it is, it returns `None`.

Next, it finds the length of the longest string in the list. In this case, the longest string is 'zzzz', which has a length of 4.

Then, it iterates over the list again. If it finds a string that has the same length as the longest string, it returns that string. In this case, the first string with length 4 is 'zzzz', so 'zzzz' is returned.

<<<Output>>>
'zzzz'
