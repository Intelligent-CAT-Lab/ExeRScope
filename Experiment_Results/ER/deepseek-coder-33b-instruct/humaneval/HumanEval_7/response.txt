<<<Analysis>>>
The function filter_by_substring takes two parameters: a list of strings and a substring. In this case, the list of strings is empty and the substring is 'john'.
The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each string in the list. For each string, it checks if the substring is in the string. Since the list is empty, there are no strings to check, so the function returns an empty list.
