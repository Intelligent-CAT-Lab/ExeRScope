The variable x is initialized to 100 and variable shift is initialized to 2.
The code converts the integer x to a string s.
The code checks if shift is greater than the length of s. If it is, it reverses the string s and returns it.
In this case, shift is not greater than the length of s, so it proceeds to the else block.
The code calculates the index to split the string s at, which is len(s) - shift.
The code then concatenates the substring of s from the split index to the end of s, and the substring from the beginning of s to the split index, and returns the result.
In this case, the split index is 2, so the code returns the string '001'.
<<<Output>>>
'001'
