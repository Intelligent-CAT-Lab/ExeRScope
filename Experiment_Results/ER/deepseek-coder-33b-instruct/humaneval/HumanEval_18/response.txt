The function `how_many_times` takes two arguments: a string and a substring. In this case, the string is an empty string and the substring is 'x'.
The function initializes a variable `times` to 0, which will be used to count the number of times the substring appears in the string.
The function then enters a loop that iterates over the string, starting from the first character and ending at the last character where the substring can fit.
For each character in the string, it checks if the substring from the current position to the position after the length of the substring is equal to the substring. If it is, it increments `times` by 1.
After the loop finishes, the function returns `times`, which is 0.
