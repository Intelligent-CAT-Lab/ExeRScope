<<<Analysis>>>
The function sum_product takes a list of integers as input. The list [1,1,1] is passed as an argument.
The function initializes two variables, sum_value and prod_value, to 0 and 1, respectively.
The function then enters a loop that iterates over each number in the input list.
For each number n in the list, it adds n to sum_value and multiplies prod_value by n.
After the loop finishes, the function returns a tuple containing sum_value and prod_value.
In this case, the sum of the numbers in the list is 3 and the product is also 3.
<<<Output>>>
(3, 1)
