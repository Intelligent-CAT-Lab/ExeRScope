<<<Analysis>>>
The function strange_sort_list takes a list of integers as input.
The function initializes an empty list res and a boolean switch to True.
The function then enters a while loop that continues until the input list lst is empty.
In each iteration of the loop, the function finds the minimum or maximum (depending on the value of switch) value in the list lst, appends it to the list res, and removes it from lst.
The function then flips the value of switch.
After the loop finishes, the function returns the list res.
<<<Output>>>
[1, 4, 2, 3]
