<<<Analysis>>>
The function is_simple_power takes two parameters, x and n. Here, x is 16 and n is 2.
The function first checks if n is equal to 1. If it is, it returns whether x is also 1. In this case, it returns False because 2 is not equal to 1.
Then, it enters a while loop that multiplies the variable power by n until power is no longer less than x. In each iteration, power is multiplied by n.
The loop continues until power is no longer less than x, which is when power is equal to or greater than x.
In this case, the loop will run twice, multiplying power by 2 each time. After the second iteration, power will be 4, then 8, then 16.
Finally, the function returns whether power is equal to x. In this case, it returns True because power (16) is equal to x (16).
