<<<Analysis>>>
The function minSubArraySum takes a list of integers as input.
The variable max_sum is initialized to 0, which will be used to keep track of the maximum sum of a subarray.
The variable s is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of the current subarray.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each number in the input list.
For each number num, it subtracts num from s (which is equivalent to adding -num). If s becomes negative, it resets s to 0.
The code updates max_sum to be the maximum of max_sum and s.
After the loop finishes, the code checks if max_sum is still 0. If it is, it means that all numbers in the input list are negative. In this case, it sets max_sum to be the maximum of the negative numbers in the list.
The code then calculates the minimum sum of a subarray by negating max_sum.
Finally, the code returns min_sum, which is the minimum sum of a subarray in the input list.
