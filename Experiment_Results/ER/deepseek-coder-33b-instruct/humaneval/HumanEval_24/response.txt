<<<Analysis>>>
The function largest_divisor takes an integer n as input.
The function then enters a loop that iterates from n-1 to 0 (inclusive).
For each number i in this range, it checks if n is divisible by i.
The condition is met when i is 2, because 3 % 2 equals 1, which is not equal to 0.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of i, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
