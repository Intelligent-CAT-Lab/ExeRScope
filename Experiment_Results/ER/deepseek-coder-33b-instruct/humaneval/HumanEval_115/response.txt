<<<Analysis>>>
The function max_fill takes two arguments: grid and capacity.
The grid is a 2D list (list of lists) where each sublist represents a row in the grid. The capacity is an integer representing the maximum capacity of a container.

The function first calculates the sum of each sublist in the grid. This is done using the sum function inside a list comprehension.

Next, the function calculates the ceiling of the division of each sum by the capacity. This is done using the ceil function from the math module. The ceil function rounds up to the nearest integer.

Finally, the function returns the sum of all these calculated values.

In the given example, the grid is [[0,0,1,0], [0,1,0,0], [1,1,1,1]] and the capacity is 1.

The sum of each sublist is [1, 1, 3].

When these sums are divided by the capacity (1), the ceil function rounds up to the nearest integer, resulting in [1, 1, 3].

The sum of these values is 5, which is the return value of the function.

5
