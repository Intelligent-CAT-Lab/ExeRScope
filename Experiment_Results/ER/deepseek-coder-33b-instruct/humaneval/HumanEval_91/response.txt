<<<Analysis>>>
The function `is_bored` takes a string `S` as input. It first imports the `re` module, which provides support for regular expressions in Python.

The function then splits the input string `S` into sentences using the `re.split` function. The regular expression `r'[.?!]\s*'` is used to split the string at each occurrence of a period, question mark, or exclamation mark, followed by any number of whitespace characters.

The function then iterates over each sentence in the list of sentences. For each sentence, it checks if the first two characters of the sentence are 'I ' (a space after 'I'). If they are, it increments a counter.

The function finally returns the total count of sentences that start with 'I '.

In the case of `is_bored("Hello world")`, the function splits the string into one sentence "Hello world". This sentence does not start with 'I ', so the function returns 0.
