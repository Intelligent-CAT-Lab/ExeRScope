<<<Analysis>>>
The function `add` takes a list `lst` as an argument. It then uses a list comprehension to create a new list that includes every other element of `lst` starting from the second element (index 1), but only if the element is even.

In the case of `add([4, 88])`, the list comprehension will only include the second element (88) because it is the only even number in the list. The sum of this list is 88.

<<<Output>>>
88
