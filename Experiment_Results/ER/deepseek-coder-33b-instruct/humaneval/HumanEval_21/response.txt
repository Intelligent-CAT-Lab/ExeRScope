<<<Analysis>>>
The function `rescale_to_unit` takes a list of floating point numbers as input. In this case, the input is [2.0, 49.9].
The function first finds the minimum and maximum values in the list using the `min` and `max` functions. In this case, the minimum value is 2.0 and the maximum value is 49.9.
The function then creates a new list where each element is the result of the following calculation: (x - min_number) / (max_number - min_number). This is a rescaling operation, where each number is rescaled to the range [0, 1] based on its position relative to the minimum and maximum values in the original list.
The resulting list is [0.0392156862745098, 0.9705882352941176]
<<<Output>>>
[0.0392156862745098, 0.9705882352941176]
