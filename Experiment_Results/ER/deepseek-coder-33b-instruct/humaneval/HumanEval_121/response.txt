<<<Analysis>>>
The function solution takes a list as an input.
The list comprehension `[x for idx, x in enumerate(lst) if idx%2==0 and x%2==1]` generates a new list that contains only the elements of the input list that are at an even index and are odd.
In the given list [5, 8, 7, 1], the elements at even indices are 5 and 7, but only 5 is odd.
The built-in sum function then adds up all the elements in the list, resulting in 5.
<<<Output>>>
5
