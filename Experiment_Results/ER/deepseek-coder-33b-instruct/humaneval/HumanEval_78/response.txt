<<<Analysis>>>
The variable num is initialized to "AB".
The variable total is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the count of prime numbers in the input string.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each character in the string num.
For each character, it checks if the character is in the tuple primes, which contains the prime numbers in hexadecimal representation.
If the character is in primes, it increments total by 1.
The condition is met when the character is 'B' and 'D'.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of total, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
