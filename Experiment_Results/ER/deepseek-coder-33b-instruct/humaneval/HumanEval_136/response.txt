<<<Analysis>>>
The function largest_smallest_integers takes a list of integers as input.
The function first filters out the negative numbers from the list and stores them in the variable smallest. In this case, the list is [2, 4, 1, 3, 5, 7], so smallest will be [2, 4, 1, 3, 5, 7].
Then, the function filters out the positive numbers from the list and stores them in the variable largest. In this case, the list is [2, 4, 1, 3, 5, 7], so largest will be [].
The function then returns a tuple. The first element of the tuple is the maximum value in smallest (which is 5 in this case), and the second element of the tuple is None, because largest is an empty list.
<<<Output>>>
(5, None)
