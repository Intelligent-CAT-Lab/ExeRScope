<<<Analysis>>>
The function `do_algebra` takes two arguments: `operator` and `operand`. The `operator` is a list of strings representing arithmetic operators, and `operand` is a list of integers.

The function starts by converting the first operand to a string and assigning it to the variable `expression`.

Then, it enters a loop that iterates over the `operator` and `operand` lists simultaneously. For each pair of operator and operand, it appends the operator and operand to the `expression` string.

In this case, the `operator` list is ['**', '*', '+'] and the `operand` list is [2, 3, 4, 5].

The loop will append '**2' to the `expression` string, then '*3' to the `expression` string, and finally '+4' to the `expression` string.

After the loop, the `expression` string will be '2**2*3+4'.

Finally, the function uses the `eval` function to evaluate the `expression` string as a Python expression. The `eval` function interprets the string as a Python expression and returns the result.

In this case, the `eval` function will return the result of the expression '2**2*3+4', which is 24.
