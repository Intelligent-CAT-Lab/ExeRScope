<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 5.
The function fib4 is defined to calculate the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence, but with a twist: each number is the sum of the four previous numbers, not the two.
The function first checks if n is less than 4. If it is, it returns the nth number in the sequence [0, 0, 2, 0].
If n is 4 or more, the function enters a loop that starts from 4 and goes up to n (inclusive).
In each iteration of the loop, the function calculates the next number in the sequence as the sum of the four previous numbers, and appends it to the results list. It then removes the first number from the list.
After the loop finishes, the function returns the last number in the results list, which is the nth number in the modified Fibonacci sequence.
