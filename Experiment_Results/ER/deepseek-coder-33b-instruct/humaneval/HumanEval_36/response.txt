<<<Analysis>>>
The function fizz_buzz takes an integer n as input.
It initializes an empty list ns.
Then it enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n (exclusive).
For each number i in this range, it checks if i is divisible by 11 or 13. If it is, it appends i to ns. The condition is met when i is 0, 11, 13, 22, 33 and 44.
After the loop finishes, it converts the list ns to a string s.
It initializes ans to 0, which will be used to count the number of '7's in the string s.
Then it enters a loop that iterates over each character c in the string s.
For each character c, it checks if c is '7'. If it is, it increments ans by 1.
After the loop finishes, it returns ans, which is the number of '7's in the string s.
