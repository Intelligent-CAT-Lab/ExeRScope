<<<Analysis>>>
The function largest_prime_factor takes an integer n as input, which is 15 in this case.
The function is_prime is defined within the function largest_prime_factor. It checks if a number is prime by iterating from 2 to the number itself and checking if the number is divisible by any of these numbers. If it is, it returns False, otherwise it returns True.
The variable largest is initialized to 1, which will be used to store the largest prime factor of n.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 2 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 2 to 15.
For each number j in this range, it checks if n is divisible by j and if j is a prime number. If both conditions are met, it updates the value of largest to be the maximum of the current largest and j.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of largest, which is 5.
<<<Output>>>
5
