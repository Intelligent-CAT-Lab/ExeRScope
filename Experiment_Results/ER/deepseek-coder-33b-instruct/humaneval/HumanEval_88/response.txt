<<<Analysis>>>
The function `sort_array` takes an array as input. The array is [15, 42, 87, 32 ,11, 0].
The function first checks if the array is empty. If it is, it returns an empty array.
If the array is not empty, it proceeds to sort the array in descending order if the sum of the first and last elements of the array is even, and in ascending order if the sum is odd.
In this case, the sum of the first and last elements is 15 + 0 = 15, which is odd. Therefore, the array is sorted in ascending order.
The sorted array is [0, 11, 15, 32, 42, 87].
<<<Output>>>
[0, 11, 15, 32, 42, 87]
