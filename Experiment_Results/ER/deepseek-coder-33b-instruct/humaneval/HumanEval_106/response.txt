<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 5.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 5.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i is even. If it is, it calculates the factorial of i and appends it to the list ret. If i is odd, it calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to i and appends it to the list ret.
The condition is met when i is 2 and 4.
For i = 2, the factorial of 2 is 2, and for i = 4, the sum of numbers from 1 to 4 is 10.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final list ret, which is [2, 10].
<<<Output>>>
[2, 10]
