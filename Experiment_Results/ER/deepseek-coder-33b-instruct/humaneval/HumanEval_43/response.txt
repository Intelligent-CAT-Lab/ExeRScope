<<<Analysis>>>
The function `pairs_sum_to_zero` takes a list `l` as input. It then iterates over the list `l` using the `enumerate` function, which returns both the index `i` and the value `l1` at that index.

For each index `i` and value `l1`, it then iterates over the remaining elements in the list `l` starting from the next index (`i + 1`) to the end of the list. For each of these values `l[j]`, it checks if the sum of `l1` and `l[j]` is equal to zero. If it is, it immediately returns `True`.

In the given list `[1, 3, 5, 0]`, the function will first check if `1` and `3`, `1` and `5`, `1` and `0` sum to zero. It will then check `3` and `5`, `3` and `0`, and finally `5` and `0`.

Since `-1` and `1` sum to zero, the function will return `True`.
