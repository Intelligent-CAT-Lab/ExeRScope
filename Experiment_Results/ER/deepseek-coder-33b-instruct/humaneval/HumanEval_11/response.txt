The function `string_xor` takes two binary strings `a` and `b` as input. It defines a helper function `xor` that performs the XOR operation on two bits.

The function then uses the `zip` function to pair up the corresponding bits from `a` and `b`. For each pair of bits, it applies the `xor` function to compute the XOR of the two bits.

The `join` function is used to concatenate all the XOR results into a single string, which is the final output of the function.

In the given example, `a` is '111000' and `b` is '101010'. The XOR operation is performed on corresponding bits:

- '1' XOR '1' is '0'
- '1' XOR '0' is '1'
- '1' XOR '1' is '0'
- '0' XOR '0' is '0'
- '0' XOR '1' is '1'
- '0' XOR '0' is '0'

So, the output of `string_xor('111000', '101010')` is '010010'.
