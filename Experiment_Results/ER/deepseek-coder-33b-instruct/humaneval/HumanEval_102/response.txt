<<<Analysis>>>
The function choose_num takes two parameters, x and y. In this case, x is 12 and y is 15.
The function first checks if x is greater than y. If it is, it returns -1. In this case, 12 is not greater than 15, so this condition is not met.
Next, the function checks if y is an even number. If it is, it returns y. In this case, 15 is not an even number, so this condition is not met.
Then, the function checks if x is equal to y. If it is, it returns -1. In this case, 12 is not equal to 15, so this condition is not met.
Finally, if none of the previous conditions are met, the function returns y - 1. In this case, it returns 14.
<<<Output>>>
