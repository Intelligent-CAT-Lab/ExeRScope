<<<Analysis>>>
The function string_sequence takes an integer n as input.
The function uses a list comprehension to generate a list of strings, where each string is a number from 0 to n (inclusive).
The join() method is then used to concatenate all the strings in the list into a single string, with each string separated by a space.
The function returns this final string.
In the case of ```string_sequence(0)```, the function will generate a list of strings from 0 to 0 (inclusive), which is ['0'].
Then, the join() method will concatenate these strings into a single string, resulting in '0'.
<<<Output>>>
'0'
