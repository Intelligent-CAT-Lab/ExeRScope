<<<Analysis>>>
The function `file_name_check` takes a string `file_name` as input.
The function first splits the `file_name` into two parts based on the '.' character.
If the length of the resulting list is not 2, it means that the file name does not have exactly one '.' character, so the function returns 'No'.
Then, it checks if the second part of the split (i.e., the file extension) is in the list `suf`. If it is not, the function returns 'No'.
Next, it checks if the first part of the split (i.e., the file name without extension) is not empty. If it is empty, the function returns 'No'.
Then, it checks if the first character of the file name is a letter. If it is not, the function returns 'No'.
Finally, it counts the number of digits in the file name. If there are more than 3 digits, the function returns 'No'.
If all these checks pass, the function returns 'Yes'.

<<<Output>>>
'Yes'
