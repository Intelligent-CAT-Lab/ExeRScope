<<<Analysis>>>
The function solve takes an integer N as input.
The function first converts the integer N into a string using the str() function.
Then it uses a generator expression to iterate over each character in the string, convert it back to an integer using the int() function, and sum up all these integers using the sum() function.
The sum of these integers is then converted to a binary string using the bin() function. The bin() function returns a string that starts with '0b' to indicate that it's a binary number, so we use array slicing [2:] to get rid of the first two characters.
Finally, the function returns the binary string.

In the case of solve(1000), N is 1000.
The function first converts 1000 to the string '1000'.
Then it sums up the integers in this string, which is 1+0+0+0+0 = 1.
The function then converts 1 to a binary string, which is '1'.
Finally, the function returns '1'.
