<<<Analysis>>>
The function filter_by_prefix takes two arguments: a list of strings and a prefix. In this case, the list of strings is an empty list [] and the prefix is 'john'.
The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each string in the list. For each string, it checks if the string starts with the given prefix using the startswith() method. If the string does start with the prefix, it is included in the new list.
Since the input list is empty, there are no strings to check. Therefore, the function returns an empty list.
