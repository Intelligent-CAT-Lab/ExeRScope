<<<Analysis>>>
The input list is [3, 1, 2, 4, 5].
The function first sorts the list in ascending order, which results in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
The function then checks if the length of the list is odd. In this case, the length is 5, which is odd.
Since the length of the list is odd, the function returns the middle element of the list.
The middle element is at index len(l) // 2, which is 5 // 2 = 2.
So, the function returns the element at index 2, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>
3
