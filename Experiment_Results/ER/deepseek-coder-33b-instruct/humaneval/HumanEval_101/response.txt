<<<Analysis>>>
The input string "Hi, my name is John" is passed to the function words_string.
The function first checks if the string is empty. If it is, it returns an empty list.
Then, it initializes an empty list s_list.
The function then iterates over each character in the string. If the character is a comma, it appends a space to s_list. If the character is not a comma, it appends the character to s_list.
After the loop, it joins all the elements in s_list into a string, and then splits this string into a list of words, using spaces as the delimiter.
The function finally returns this list of words.

<<<Output>>>
['Hi', 'my', 'name', 'is', 'John']
