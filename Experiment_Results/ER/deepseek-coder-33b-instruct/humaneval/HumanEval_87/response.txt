<<<Analysis>>>
The function get_row takes two arguments: a list of lists (lst) and an integer (x). The list lst is empty, so there are no elements to search for the integer x.
The list comprehension generates a list of tuples (coords), where each tuple represents the coordinates (i, j) of the elements in lst that are equal to x. However, since lst is empty, there are no elements to search for, so coords is also empty.
The sorted function is called on coords, but since coords is empty, it returns an empty list.
Finally, the function returns an empty list.
