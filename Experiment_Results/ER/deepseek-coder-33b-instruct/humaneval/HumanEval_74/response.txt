<<<Analysis>>>
The function total_match takes two lists as input, lst1 and lst2.
The function first initializes two variables, l1 and l2, to 0.
Then it enters a loop that iterates over each string in lst1 and adds the length of the string to l1.
After that, it does the same for lst2 and l2.
The function then checks if l1 is less than or equal to l2. If it is, it returns lst1. If not, it returns lst2.
In the given example, lst1 is ['hi', 'admin'] and lst2 is ['hi', 'hi'].
The lengths of the strings in lst1 are 2 and 5, which sums up to 7.
The lengths of the strings in lst2 are 2 and 2, which sums up to 4.
Since 7 is not less than or equal to 4, the function returns lst2.
<<<Output>>>
['hi', 'hi']
