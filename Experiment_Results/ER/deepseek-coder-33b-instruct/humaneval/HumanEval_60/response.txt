<<<Analysis>>>
The function sum_to_n takes an integer n as input.
The function then uses the built-in Python function range(n + 1) to generate a sequence of numbers from 0 to n.
The built-in Python function sum() is then used to calculate the sum of these numbers.
The function returns the sum of these numbers.
In the case of ```sum_to_n(1)```, the function generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to 1 (inclusive). The sum of these numbers is 0 + 1 = 1.
So, the return value of ```sum_to_n(1)``` is 1.
