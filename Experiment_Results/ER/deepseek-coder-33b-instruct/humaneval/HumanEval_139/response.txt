The variable n is initialized to 4.
The variable fact_i is initialized to 1, which will be used to calculate the factorial of each number from 1 to n.
The variable special_fact is initialized to 1, which will be used to calculate the special factorial.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 4.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the factorial of i and stores it in fact_i. Then it multiplies the current special_fact by fact_i and stores the result back in special_fact.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of special_fact, which is 34560.
<<<Output>>>
34560
