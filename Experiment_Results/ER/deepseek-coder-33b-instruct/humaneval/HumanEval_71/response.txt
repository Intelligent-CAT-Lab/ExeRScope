The function triangle_area takes three arguments: a, b, and c. These represent the lengths of the sides of a triangle.
The function first checks if the given lengths can form a triangle. A triangle is valid if the sum of the lengths of any two sides is greater than the length of the third side. If the lengths cannot form a triangle, the function returns -1.
In this case, a = 3, b = 4, and c = 5. These lengths can form a triangle, so the function continues to the next step.
The function then calculates the semi-perimeter of the triangle, which is the sum of the lengths of the sides divided by 2. In this case, the semi-perimeter is (3 + 4 + 5)/2 = 6.
The function then calculates the area of the triangle using Heron's formula, which is the square root of [s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c)], where s is the semi-perimeter and a, b, and c are the lengths of the sides of the triangle. In this case, the area is (6 * (6 - 3) * (6 - 4) * (6 - 5)) ** 0.5 = 6.
The function then rounds the area to two decimal places using the round function. In this case, the rounded area is 6.0.
Finally, the function returns the area of the triangle.

6.0
