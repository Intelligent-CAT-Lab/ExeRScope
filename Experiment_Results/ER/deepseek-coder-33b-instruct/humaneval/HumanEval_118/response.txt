The function get_closest_vowel takes a string "yogurt" as input.
The function first checks if the length of the string is less than 3. If it is, it returns an empty string.
The function then defines a set of vowels.
The function then iterates over the string from the end to the beginning, skipping the first and the last character.
For each character, it checks if it is a vowel and if the characters before and after it are not vowels. If both conditions are met, it returns the current character.
In the given string "yogurt", the function checks the characters 'u', 'o', 'g', 'r', 't' in that order.
The first character that meets the conditions is 'o'.
<<<Output>>>
o
