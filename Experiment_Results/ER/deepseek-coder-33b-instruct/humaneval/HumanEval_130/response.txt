The variable n is initialized to 3.
The function checks if n is 0. If it is, it returns a list with a single element, 1.
If n is not 0, it initializes a list my_tri with two elements, 1 and 3.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 2 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 2 to 3.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i is even. If it is, it appends i / 2 + 1 to my_tri. If i is odd, it appends the sum of the last two elements of my_tri and i + 3 / 2 to my_tri.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final list my_tri, which is [1, 3, 2.5, 6.5].
<<<Output>>>
[1, 3, 2.5, 6.5]
