<<<Analysis>>>
The input to the function is a list with a single element, [5].
The function first initializes a dictionary count_digit with keys as the elements of the list and values as 0. In this case, the dictionary will have only one key-value pair {5: 0}.
The function then iterates over the list and increments the count of each element in the dictionary. In this case, the dictionary will still have only one key-value pair {5: 1}.
The function then checks if any element in the list appears more than twice. In this case, there are no elements that appear more than twice, so the condition fails.
The function then checks if the list is sorted in ascending order. In this case, the list has only one element, so it is considered sorted.
Finally, the function returns True, indicating that the list is sorted.

<<<Output>>>
True
