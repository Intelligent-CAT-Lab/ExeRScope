<<<Analysis>>>
The function `select_words` takes two arguments: a string `s` and an integer `n`.
The string `s` is split into words using the `split` method, which splits the string at each space character.
For each word in the list of words, the function calculates the number of consonants in the word.
A consonant is defined as any letter that is not a vowel (a, e, i, o, u).
If the number of consonants in a word equals `n`, the word is added to the list `result`.
The function returns the list `result`, which contains all words in `s` that have exactly `n` consonants.
In the given example, the words "Mary", "had", "little", "lamb" have 4 consonants each, so they are all added to the result list.
<<<Output>>>
['Mary', 'had', 'little', 'lamb']
