<<<Analysis>>>
The function `prime_fib(n: int)` takes an integer `n` as input.
The function `is_prime(p)` checks if a number `p` is prime. It returns `False` if `p` is less than 2 or if `p` is divisible by any number from 2 to the square root of `p`. Otherwise, it returns `True`.
The function `prime_fib(n: int)` initializes a list `f` with the first two Fibonacci numbers, 0 and 1.
The function enters a loop that continues until `n` is reduced to 0.
In each iteration of the loop, the function calculates the next Fibonacci number by adding the last two numbers in the list `f` and appends it to `f`.
The function then checks if the last number in `f` is prime. If it is, `n` is reduced by 1.
When `n` is reduced to 0, the function returns the last number in `f`.
