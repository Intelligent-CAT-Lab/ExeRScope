<<<Analysis>>>
The function any_int takes three arguments: x, y, and z.
The function first checks if all three arguments are integers. If any of them are not, the function immediately returns False.
If all three arguments are integers, the function then checks if any two of them sum to the third. If they do, the function returns True. If they don't, the function returns False.
In this case, x is 2, y is 3, and z is 1. Since 2+3 equals 5, which is not equal to 1, the function returns False.
<<<Output>>>
False
