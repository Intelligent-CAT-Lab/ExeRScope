<<<Analysis>>>
The input list is [1,2,3].
The function sum_squares is defined to square the elements at indices that are multiples of 3 and cube the elements at indices that are multiples of 4 but not 3.
The function iterates over the indices of the list.
For the first element (index 0), it is not a multiple of 3 or 4, so it is added to the result list as is.
For the second element (index 1), it is not a multiple of 3 or 4, so it is added to the result list as is.
For the third element (index 2), it is a multiple of 3, so its square (which is 9) is added to the result list.
The function then returns the sum of the elements in the result list.
