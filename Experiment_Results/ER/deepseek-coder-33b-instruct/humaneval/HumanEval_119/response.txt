The function `match_parens` takes a list of two strings as input. In this case, the input is `['()(', ')']`.

The function `check` is defined inside `match_parens`. It takes a string as input and checks if the parentheses in the string are balanced. It does this by iterating over each character in the string. If it encounters an opening parenthesis, it increments a counter. If it encounters a closing parenthesis, it decrements the counter. If at any point the counter goes below zero, it returns False because this means there is a closing parenthesis without a corresponding opening parenthesis. If it finishes iterating over the string and the counter is not zero, it returns False because this means there are unmatched opening parentheses. If it finishes iterating over the string and the counter is zero, it returns True because this means all parentheses are balanced.

The function `match_parens` then concatenates the two strings in the input list in two different orders, `S1` and `S2`. In this case, `S1` is '()(' + ')' = '()()', and `S2` is ')' + '()(' = ')('.

The function `match_parens` then checks if either `S1` or `S2` is balanced by calling `check` on them. In this case, `check('()()')` returns True and `check(')(')` returns False. Since `check('()()')` returns True, the function returns 'Yes'.

<<<Output>>>
'Yes'
