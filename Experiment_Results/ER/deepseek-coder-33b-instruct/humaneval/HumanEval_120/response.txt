<<<Analysis>>>
The function maximum takes in two parameters: arr and k.
The array arr is [-3, -4, 5] and k is 3.
The function first checks if k is 0. If it is, it returns an empty list.
If k is not 0, it sorts the array in ascending order. In this case, the sorted array is [-4, -3, 5].
Then it takes the last k elements from the sorted array. In this case, it takes the last 3 elements, which are -3, -4, and 5.
Finally, it returns the last k elements, which are [-3, -4, 5].
<<<Output>>>
[-3, -4, 5]
