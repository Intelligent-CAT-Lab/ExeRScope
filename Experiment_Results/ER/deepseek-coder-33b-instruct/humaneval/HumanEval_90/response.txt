<<<Analysis>>>
The input to the function next_smallest is a list of integers [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
The function first removes any duplicate values from the list by converting it to a set and then back to a list. The set data type in Python does not allow duplicate values, so this operation effectively removes any duplicates from the list.
The sorted function is then used to sort the list in ascending order.
The function then checks if the length of the list is less than 2. If it is, it means there are less than 2 unique numbers in the list, so it returns None.
If the length of the list is 2 or more, it returns the second smallest number in the list, which is the second element of the sorted list (index 1).
<<<Output>>>
2
