<<<Analysis>>>
The function pluck takes an array as input.
The function first checks if the array is empty. If it is, it returns an empty array.
Then it filters the array to get only the even numbers.
If there are no even numbers, it returns an empty array.
If there are even numbers, it returns a list containing the smallest even number and its index in the original array.
In the given example, the array [4,2,3] contains the even number 2. The smallest even number is 2 and its index in the original array is 1.
So, the function returns [2, 1].

<<<Output>>>
[2, 1]
