<<<Analysis>>>
The input string 'a b b a' is passed to the function histogram.
The function first splits the string into a list of words, resulting in ['a', 'b', 'b', 'a'].
Then it initializes a dictionary dict1 to store the frequency of each word.
The variable t is used to keep track of the maximum frequency encountered so far.
The function then iterates over the list of words. For each word, it checks if its count in the list is greater than the current maximum frequency t. If it is, it updates t to the count of the word.
After the loop, if t is greater than 0, it means there is at least one word with a frequency greater than 0. It then iterates over the list again, and for each word, if its count in the list is equal to t, it adds the word and its count to the dictionary dict1.
Finally, the function returns the dictionary dict1.
<<<Output>>>
{'a': 2, 'b': 2}
