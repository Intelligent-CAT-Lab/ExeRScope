<<<Analysis>>>
The input string "<<><>>" is passed to the function correct_bracketing.
The variable depth is initialized to 0, which will be used to keep track of the current depth of the brackets.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each character b in the string brackets.
For each character b, if b is "<", depth is incremented by 1. If b is ">", depth is decremented by 1.
The code checks if depth is less than 0. If it is, it immediately returns False, because this means there is a closing bracket without a corresponding opening bracket.
After the loop finishes, the code checks if depth is equal to 0. If it is, it returns True, because this means all opening brackets have been closed. If depth is not 0, it returns False, because this means there are unclosed opening brackets.
In the given string "<<><>>", the depth will be 0 at the end, so the function will return True.
<<<Output>>>
True
