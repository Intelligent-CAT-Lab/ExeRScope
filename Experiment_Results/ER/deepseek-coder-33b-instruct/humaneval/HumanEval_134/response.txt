<<<Analysis>>>
The function `check_if_last_char_is_a_letter` takes a string `txt` as input.
The function first splits the string `txt` into a list of words using the `split` method. The `split(' ')` method splits the string at each space character, resulting in a list of words. The `[-1]` indexing operation then selects the last word in the list.
The function then checks if the last word is a single character. It does this by checking if the length of the last word is 1.
If the last word is a single character, the function checks if the character is a letter. It does this by converting the character to lowercase using the `lower` method and then getting its ASCII value using the `ord` function. The ASCII value of 'a' is 97 and the ASCII value of 'z' is 122. Therefore, if the ASCII value of the character is between 97 and 122 (inclusive), the character is a letter.
If the last word is a single character and the character is a letter, the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.
In the case of `check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple")`, the last word is "apple", which is a multi-character word. Therefore, the function returns `False`.
<<<Output>>>
