<<<Analysis>>>
The function `change_base` takes two arguments: `x` and `base`. `x` is the number to be converted, and `base` is the base to which `x` should be converted.

The function initializes an empty string `ret`, which will be used to store the result.

The function then enters a loop that continues until `x` is no longer greater than 0. In each iteration of the loop, the function calculates the remainder of `x` divided by `base` (`x % base`), converts it to a string, and prepends it to `ret`. It then divides `x` by `base` (`x //= base`) and repeats the process.

For `change_base(8, 3)`, the loop will iterate twice:

1. First iteration: `x` is 8, `base` is 3. The remainder of 8 divided by 3 is 2, so `ret` becomes "2". `x` is then divided by `base`, which is 8 // 3 = 2.
2. Second iteration: `x` is 2, `base` is 3. The remainder of 2 divided by 3 is 2, so `ret` becomes "22". `x` is then divided by `base`, which is 2 // 3 = 0.

Since `x` is no longer greater than 0, the loop ends. The function returns `ret`, which is "22".
