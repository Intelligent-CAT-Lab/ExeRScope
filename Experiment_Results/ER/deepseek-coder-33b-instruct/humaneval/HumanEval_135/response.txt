<<<Analysis>>>
The function can_arrange takes a list of integers as input. The variable ind is initialized to -1, which will be used to store the index of the first element that is less than its previous element. The variable i is initialized to 1, which is the index of the second element in the list.
The code then enters a while loop that continues until i is equal to the length of the list. For each iteration, it checks if the current element arr[i] is less than its previous element arr[i-1]. If it is, it updates the value of ind to i. The loop then increments i by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of ind. If no such element is found, ind will remain -1. In the given example, the first element that is less than its previous element is 4, which is at index 2. Therefore, the function will return 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
