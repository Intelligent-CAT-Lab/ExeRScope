The function iscube takes an integer as input. The input is 1.
The function first calculates the absolute value of the input, which is 1.
Then it calculates the cube root of the absolute value, rounds it to the nearest integer, and squares it. If the result is equal to the original absolute value, the function returns True, otherwise it returns False.
In this case, the cube root of 1 is 1, squared is 1, which is equal to the original value. Therefore, the function returns True.
