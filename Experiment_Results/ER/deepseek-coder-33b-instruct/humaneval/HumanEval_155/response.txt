<<<Analysis>>>
The function even_odd_count takes an integer as input. The input is 7.
The function initializes two variables, even_count and odd_count, to 0. These will be used to count the number of even and odd digits in the input number.
The function then converts the absolute value of the input number to a string. This is done to easily iterate over each digit in the number.
The function then enters a loop that iterates over each digit in the string representation of the input number.
For each digit, it checks if the digit is even or odd. If the digit is even, it increments even_count by 1. If the digit is odd, it increments odd_count by 1.
After the loop finishes, the function returns a tuple containing the values of even_count and odd_count.
<<<Output>>>
(0, 1)
