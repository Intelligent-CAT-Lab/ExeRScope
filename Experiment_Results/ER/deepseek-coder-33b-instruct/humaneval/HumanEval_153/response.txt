<<<Analysis>>>
The function `Strongest_Extension` takes two arguments: `class_name` and `extensions`. In this case, `class_name` is 'Watashi' and `extensions` is ['tEN', 'niNE', 'eIGHt8OKe'].

The function first initializes `strong` to the first element of `extensions`, which is 'tEN'. It then calculates the difference between the number of uppercase and lowercase letters in 'tEN'. This difference is stored in `my_val`.

The function then enters a loop that iterates over each element in `extensions`. For each element, it calculates the difference between the number of uppercase and lowercase letters. If this difference is greater than `my_val`, it updates `strong` to the current element and `my_val` to the new difference.

In this case, 'tEN' has 2 uppercase letters and 2 lowercase letters, so `my_val` is 0. 'niNE' has 2 uppercase letters and 3 lowercase letters, so `my_val` is -1. 'eIGHt8OKe' has 3 uppercase letters and 5 lowercase letters, so `my_val` is 2.

Since 'eIGHt8OKe' has the highest difference, it is the strongest extension.

Finally, the function concatenates `class_name` and `strong` with a period in between and returns the result.

<<<Output>>>
'Watashi.eIGHt8OKe'
