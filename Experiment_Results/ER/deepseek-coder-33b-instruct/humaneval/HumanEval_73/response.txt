<<<Analysis>>>
The input array is [1,2,3,5,4,7,9,6].
The function smallest_change is defined to find the minimum number of changes needed to make the array a palindrome.
The function iterates over the first half of the array.
For each element at index i, it checks if the element is not equal to the corresponding element from the end of the array (which is at index len(arr) - i - 1).
If the elements are not equal, it increments the variable ans by 1.
The function returns the final value of ans, which is the minimum number of changes needed to make the array a palindrome.
In this case, the array is not a palindrome, so the function needs to make changes.
The changes needed are:
- Change the 5 to a 5 to make the array a palindrome.
- Change the 4 to a 4 to make the array a palindrome.
- Change the 7 to a 7 to make the array a palindrome.
So, the function returns 3.

<<<Output>>>
3
