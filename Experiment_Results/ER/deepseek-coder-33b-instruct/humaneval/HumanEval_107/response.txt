<<<Analysis>>>
The function even_odd_palindrome(n) is defined to take an integer n as input. It then defines a helper function is_palindrome(n) that checks if a number is a palindrome.

The function then initializes two counters, even_palindrome_count and odd_palindrome_count, to 0.

The function then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive). For each number i in this range, it checks if i is odd or even. If i is odd and is a palindrome, it increments odd_palindrome_count. If i is even and is a palindrome, it increments even_palindrome_count.

The function then returns a tuple containing the counts of even and odd palindromes.

In the case of even_odd_palindrome(123), the function will check the numbers 1 to 123. It will find that 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, 99, 101, 111, 121 are palindromes. Out of these, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, 99, 111, 121 are odd and the rest are even. So, the function will return (10, 13).

<<<Output>>>
(10, 13)
