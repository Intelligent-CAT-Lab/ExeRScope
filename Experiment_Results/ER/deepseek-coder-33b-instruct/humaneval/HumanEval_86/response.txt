<<<Analysis>>>
The function anti_shuffle takes a string 's' as input.
The function first splits the string 's' into a list of words using the split() method.
Then, for each word in the list, it converts the word into a list of characters using the list() function.
The sorted() function is then used to sort the list of characters in alphabetical order.
The join() method is used to convert the sorted list of characters back into a string.
Finally, the join() method is used again to convert the list of sorted strings back into a single string, with the words separated by spaces.

In the case of 'Hi', the function first splits the string into ['Hi'].
Then, for each word in the list, it converts the word into a list of characters, which gives [['H', 'i']].
The sorted() function is then used to sort the list of characters in alphabetical order, giving [['H', 'i']].
The join() method is used to convert the sorted list of characters back into a string, giving ['Hi'].
Finally, the join() method is used again to convert the list of sorted strings back into a single string, giving 'Hi'.

<<<Output>>>
'Hi'
