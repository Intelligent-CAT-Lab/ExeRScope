<<<Analysis>>>
The input string 'Hello' is passed to the function prime_length.
The function first calculates the length of the string, which is 5.
Then it checks if the length is 0 or 1. In this case, it's not, so it proceeds to the next step.
The function then enters a loop that iterates from 2 to the length of the string (exclusive).
For each number i in this range, it checks if the length of the string is divisible by i. If it is, it returns False, as this means the length is not a prime number.
If the function finishes the loop without finding a divisor, it returns True, indicating that the length of the string is a prime number.
<<<Output>>>
False
