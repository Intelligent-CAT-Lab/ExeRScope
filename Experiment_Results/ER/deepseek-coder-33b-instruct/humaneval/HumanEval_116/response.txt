<<<Analysis>>>
The function `sort_array` takes a list of integers as input.
The function first sorts the input list in ascending order using the `sorted` function.
Then it sorts the sorted list again, but this time it sorts the list based on the number of '1's in the binary representation of each number.
The `bin` function is used to convert each number to its binary representation.
The `count` function is used to count the number of '1's in the binary representation.
The `key` parameter of the `sorted` function is set to a lambda function that takes a number and returns the count of '1's in its binary representation.
The `sorted` function is called twice, first on the original list and then on the sorted list.
The output of the function is the sorted list of numbers.

<<<Output>>>
[1, 2, 4, 3, 5]
