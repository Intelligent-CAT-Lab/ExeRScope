<<<Analysis>>>
The function `simplify` takes two arguments, `x` and `n`, which are strings representing fractions.
The function splits `x` and `n` into two parts each, separating the numerator and the denominator.
For `x`, it splits "1/5" into "1" and "5", and for `n`, it splits "5/1" into "5" and "1".
Then, it multiplies the numerators and the denominators separately.
The numerator becomes 1*5 = 5, and the denominator becomes 5*1 = 5.
Then, it checks if the division of the numerator by the denominator is an integer.
In this case, 5 divided by 5 equals 1, which is an integer.
Therefore, the function returns True.
<<<Output>>>
True
