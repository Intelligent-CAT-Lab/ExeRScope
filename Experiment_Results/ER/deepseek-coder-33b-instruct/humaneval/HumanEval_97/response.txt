<<<Analysis>>>
The function multiply takes two arguments, a and b.
The function calculates the modulus of a and b with 10, which gives the last digit of a and b.
The function then multiplies the last digits of a and b.
In the case of ```multiply(148, 412)```, the last digits of 148 and 412 are 8 and 2 respectively.
The function then multiplies 8 and 2, which gives 16.
<<<Output>>>
16
