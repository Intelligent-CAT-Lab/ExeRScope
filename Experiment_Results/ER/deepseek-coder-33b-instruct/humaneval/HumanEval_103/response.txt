<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and m are initialized to 1 and 5, respectively.
The code then checks if m is less than n. If it is, it returns -1. In this case, m is not less than n, so the condition is not met.
The code then initializes a variable summation to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers from n to m.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from n to m (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 5.
For each number i in this range, it adds the current number i to summation.
After the loop finishes, the code calculates the average of the numbers from n to m by dividing summation by the number of numbers (m - n + 1).
The code then rounds this average to the nearest integer and converts it to binary.
The code returns the binary representation of the rounded average, which is '0b110'.
<<<Output>>>
'0b110'
