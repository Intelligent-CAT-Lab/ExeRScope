<<<Analysis>>>
The input to the function is a list of integers [2, 1, 1, 4, 5, 8, 2, 3].
The function first sorts the input list in descending order, which gives [8, 5, 4, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1].
Then it initializes an empty list new_arr.
The function then iterates over each element in the sorted list. For each element, it tries to append the corresponding value from the dictionary dic to new_arr.
The dictionary dic maps integers to their English word representations. For example, dic[1] is "One", dic[2] is "Two", etc.
In this case, the function will try to append dic[8], dic[5], dic[4], dic[3], dic[2], dic[2], dic[1], and dic[1] to new_arr.
However, since the dictionary does not have a key for 0, the function will catch the KeyError and pass, thus skipping the element 0.
Finally, the function returns new_arr, which is ['Eight', 'Five', 'Four', 'Three', 'Two', 'Two', 'One', 'One'].
<<<Output>>>
['Eight', 'Five', 'Four', 'Three', 'Two', 'Two', 'One', 'One']
