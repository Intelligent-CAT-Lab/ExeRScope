<<<Analysis>>>
The function is_multiply_prime(a) checks if a number a can be expressed as a product of three prime numbers.
The function is_prime(n) checks if a number n is prime. It does this by checking if n is divisible by any number from 2 to n-1. If n is divisible by any of these numbers, it is not prime and the function returns False. If n is not divisible by any of these numbers, it is prime and the function returns True.
The function is_multiply_prime(a) first checks if a is a prime number. If a is not a prime number, it returns False.
If a is a prime number, it then checks all possible combinations of three prime numbers (from 2 to 100) to see if they can multiply to give a. If it finds a combination that multiplies to give a, it returns True. If it doesn't find any combination that multiplies to give a, it returns False.
In the case of is_multiply_prime(5), 5 is not a prime number, so the function returns False.
<<<Output>>>
False
