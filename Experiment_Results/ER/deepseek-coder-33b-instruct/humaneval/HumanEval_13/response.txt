The function greatest_common_divisor takes two integers, a and b, as input.
The function uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a and b.
The Euclidean algorithm is a way to find the GCD of two numbers. It works by repeatedly replacing the larger number with the difference of the two numbers, until the two numbers are equal.
In this case, a is 3 and b is 7.
The while loop continues until b is 0.
In each iteration of the loop, b replaces a, and the remainder of a divided by b replaces b.
So, in the first iteration, a becomes 7 and b becomes 3.
In the second iteration, a becomes 3 and b becomes 1.
In the third iteration, a becomes 1 and b becomes 0.
The loop ends when b is 0, and the GCD is the current value of a, which is 1.
