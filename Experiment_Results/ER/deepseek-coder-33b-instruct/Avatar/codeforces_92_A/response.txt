<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and m are initialized to 24 and 7440, respectively.
The code then enters a while loop that continues until a break statement is encountered.
Inside the loop, the code checks if i + 1 is greater than m. If it is, it sets ans to m and breaks the loop.
If i + 1 is not greater than m, it subtracts i + 1 from m and increments i by 1.
Then, it calculates the modulus of i by n and assigns the result back to i.
The loop continues until the break statement is encountered.
The code then prints the final value of ans, which is 7440.
<<<Output>>>
7440
