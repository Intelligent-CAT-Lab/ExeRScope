<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 99992.
The variables l and r are initialized to 1 and n, respectively.
The code then enters a while loop that continues until l is not less than r.
In each iteration of the loop, the code calculates the midpoint between l and r, and then calculates the sum of the first mid natural numbers.
If the sum of the first mid natural numbers is less than n, the code sets l to mid + 1.
If the sum of the first mid natural numbers is not less than n, the code sets r to mid.
The loop continues until l is equal to r, which is the position of the largest number less than n that is a triangular number.
The code then subtracts the sum of the first l natural numbers from n, and prints the result.
