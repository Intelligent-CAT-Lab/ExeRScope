The input is 333333357. This number is assigned to the variable N.
The function aaa is defined, which takes a string n as an argument. It checks if the integer value of n is greater than N. If it is, it returns 0.
The function then checks if the set of characters in the string n is equal to the set of characters in the string '753'. If it is, it assigns 1 to ans, otherwise it assigns 0.
The function then enters a loop that iterates over the string '753'. For each character i in this string, it calls itself with the argument n + i. The result of this call is added to ans.
Finally, the function returns ans.
The function aaa is then called with the argument '0', and the result is printed.
