<<<Analysis>>>
The input is split into a list of strings, and each string is converted to an integer. The list x is [45, 99].
The code then assigns the first element of the list to the variable a and the second element to the variable b.
The code then prints the minimum value in the list (which is 45) and a space.
The code then checks if the absolute difference between a and b is greater than or equal to 2. In this case, it is, so it prints the integer division of the absolute difference by 2 (which is 24).
<<<Output>>>
45 24
