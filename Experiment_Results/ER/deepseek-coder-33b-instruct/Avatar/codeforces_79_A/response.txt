<<<Analysis>>>
The variable x and y are initialized to 1 and 20, respectively.
The variable CielWon is initialized to False, which will be used to track whether Ciel wins the game.
The code then enters a loop that continues until y is less than or equal to 1 or x*10 + y is less than or equal to 21.
In each iteration of the loop, the code calculates the minimum of x and 2 and subtracts this value from x. It then subtracts (2 - t) * 10 + 2 from y.
If y is less than 2 or 10 * x + y is less than 22, it sets CielWon to True and breaks the loop.
After the loop finishes, the code prints 'Ciel' if CielWon is True, otherwise it prints 'Hanako'.
<<<Output>>>
Hanako
