The variable x is initialized to 366735600000.
The function factorization is defined to factorize a number into its prime factors and their counts. It first initializes an empty list arr to store the prime factors and their counts. It then enters a loop that iterates from 2 to the square root of n (rounded up to the nearest integer). For each number i in this range, if i is a factor of n, it counts how many times i divides n and appends a list [i, count] to arr. If n is not 1 after the loop, it appends [n, 1] to arr. If arr is empty after the loop, it appends [n, 1] to arr.
The function factorization is then called with x as the argument, and the result is stored in l.
The list l is sorted in ascending order.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of the counts of the prime factors.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the elements in l. For each element in l, if the prime factor is 1, it continues to the next iteration. Otherwise, it calculates the sum of the counts of the prime factors and adds it to ans.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
