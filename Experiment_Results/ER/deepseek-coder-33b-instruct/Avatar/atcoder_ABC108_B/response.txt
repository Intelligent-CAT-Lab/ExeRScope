<<<Analysis>>>
The variable x1, y1, x2, y2 are initialized to 2, 3, 6, 6, respectively.
The variables a and b are calculated as the differences between x2 and x1, and y2 and y1, respectively.
In this case, a is 4 (6 - 2) and b is 3 (6 - 3).
The code then prints four values: x2 - b, y2 + a, x1 - b, y1 + a.
The first value is 6 - 3 = 3, the second value is 6 + 4 = 10, the third value is 2 - 3 = -1, and the fourth value is 3 + 4 = 7.
<<<Output>>>
3 10 -1 7
