<<<Analysis>>>
The input is split into two variables, a and b. The input is '814793613347395 1.99'.
The variable a is assigned the string '814793613347395' and the variable b is assigned the string '1.99'.
The variable b is then modified to remove the second character, so b becomes '199'.
Both a and b are then converted to integers.
The code then multiplies a and b, and then divides the result by 100. The result of the multiplication is 1594185206673684.5, which is then divided by 100 to get 1594185206673684.
Finally, the code prints the result, which is 1594185206673684.

<<<Output>>>
1594185206673684
