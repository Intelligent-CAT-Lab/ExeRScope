The variable M is initialized to a list of integers obtained from the input. The input is split by spaces and each part is converted to an integer. In this case, M is [7, 896, 7].
The variables a, b, and n are assigned the first, second, and third elements of M, respectively. In this case, a is 7, b is 896, and n is 7.
The code then checks if a is not equal to 0. If it is not, it checks if b is divisible by a. If it is not, it prints 'No solution'. If it is, it divides b by a and assigns the result to b.
Then, it initializes two variables x and y to 0 and -2000, respectively. If b is greater than or equal to 0, it enters a while loop that calculates the nth power of x and assigns it to y. If y is greater than b, it prints 'No solution'. If y is less than or equal to b, it prints x - 1.
If b is less than 0, it checks if n is divisible by 2. If it is, it prints 'No solution'. If it is not, it initializes x to -1 and y to 2000. It then enters a while loop that calculates the nth power of x and assigns it to y. If y is less than b, it prints 'No solution'. If y is greater than or equal to b, it prints x + 1.
If a is equal to 0, it checks if b is equal to 0. If it is, it prints 5. If it is not, it prints 'No solution'.
