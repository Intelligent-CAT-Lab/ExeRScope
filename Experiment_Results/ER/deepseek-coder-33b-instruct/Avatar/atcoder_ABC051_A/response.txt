<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string input from the user. The input is a comma-separated string. The replace() function is used to replace all commas in the string with spaces. The result is a string where all commas have been replaced with spaces.

For example, if the input is "pnxnn,muduhzn,aquud", the output will be "pnxnn muduhzn aquud".

<<<Output>>>
pnxnn muduhzn aquud
