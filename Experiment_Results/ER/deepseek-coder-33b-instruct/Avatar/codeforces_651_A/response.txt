<<<Analysis>>>
The variable a1 and a2 are initialized to 100 and 25, respectively.
The variable t is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of operations performed.
The code then checks if a1 and a2 are both 1. If they are, it prints 0 and exits.
If not, it enters a while loop that continues until either a1 or a2 becomes 0.
In each iteration of the loop, it checks if a1 is greater than a2. If it is, it increments a2 by 1 and decrements a1 by 2. If a1 is not greater than a2, it decrements a2 by 2 and increments a1 by 1.
The loop continues until either a1 or a2 becomes 0.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of t, which is the number of operations performed.
<<<Output>>>
