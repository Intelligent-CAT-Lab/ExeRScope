<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 512.
The code then enters a while loop that continues as long as n is even (i.e., n % 2 == 0). Inside the loop, n is divided by 2.
The loop will continue to divide n by 2 until n becomes an odd number.
After the loop finishes, the code checks if n is 1. If it is, it prints 'YES'. If it's not, it prints 'NO'.
In this case, n will be divided by 2 three times until it becomes 1. So, the output will be 'YES'.
<<<Output>>>
YES
