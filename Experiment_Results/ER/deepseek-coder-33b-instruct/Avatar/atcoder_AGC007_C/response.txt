<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n, d and x are initialized to 1000, 100 and 100, respectively.
The precision of the decimal numbers is set to 200.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 1000.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the value of an expression and adds it to ans.
The expression is ((n - i + 1) / i) * (d + x * (n * 2 - 1) / 2).
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans.
