<<<Analysis>>>
The variable r, D and x are initialized to 2, 1 and 2, respectively.
The code then enters a loop that iterates 10 times.
For each iteration, it calculates a new value for x based on the formula x = r * x - D.
The new value of x is then printed.
The first iteration, x becomes 2 * 2 - 1 = 3.
The second iteration, x becomes 2 * 3 - 1 = 5.
The third iteration, x becomes 2 * 5 - 1 = 9.
The fourth iteration, x becomes 2 * 9 - 1 = 17.
The fifth iteration, x becomes 2 * 17 - 1 = 33.
The sixth iteration, x becomes 2 * 33 - 1 = 65.
The seventh iteration, x becomes 2 * 65 - 1 = 129.
The eighth iteration, x becomes 2 * 129 - 1 = 257.
The ninth iteration, x becomes 2 * 257 - 1 = 513.
The tenth iteration, x becomes 2 * 513 - 1 = 1025.
