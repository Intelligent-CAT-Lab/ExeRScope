<<<Analysis>>>
The variable A, B and T are initialized to 20, 20 and 19, respectively.
The code then calculates the integer division of T by A and multiplies the result by B. This is equivalent to finding out how many times A can fit into T and then multiplying that by B.
The code prints the final value of ans, which is 40.
<<<Output>>>
40
