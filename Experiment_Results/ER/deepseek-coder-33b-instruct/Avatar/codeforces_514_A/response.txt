<<<Analysis>>>
The input is a string "5728".
The first character of the string is "5", which is not equal to "9". So, the code skips the if condition and moves to the else condition.
The else condition simply assigns the input string to the variable st.
The output of the code is the integer value of the string st, which is 5728.
<<<Output>>>
