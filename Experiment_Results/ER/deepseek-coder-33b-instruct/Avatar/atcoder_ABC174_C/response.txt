The variable K is initialized to 260522.
The code then checks if K is even. If it is, it prints -1 and exits the program.
The variable cnt is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of times the loop is executed.
The variable now is initialized to 0, which will be used to store the current value of the number formed by concatenating 7s.
The code then enters a loop that iterates 10^6 times.
For each iteration, it increments cnt by 1, multiplies now by 10, adds 7, and takes the modulus of K.
If now is 0 after the operation, it prints cnt and exits the program.
If the loop finishes without finding a number that is a multiple of K, it prints -1.
<<<Output>>>
-1
