<<<Analysis>>>
The variable X is initialized to 1.
The variable i is initialized to 1, which will be used to count the number of iterations.
The variable a is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of X.
The code then enters a while loop that continues indefinitely.
In each iteration of the loop, the code adds X to a.
The code then checks if a is divisible by 360. If it is, it prints the current value of i and breaks the loop.
If a is not divisible by 360, the code increments i by 1 and continues with the next iteration.
The loop will continue indefinitely until a is divisible by 360, which will happen when X is added to a 360 times.
In this case, X is 1, so a will be 360 after 360 iterations.
<<<Output>>>
360
