The variable k, variable n and variable w are initialized to 1000, 1000000000 and 1000, respectively.
variable sum is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the total cost of bananas.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to w (inclusive), meaning it will consider multiples of k from 1 to 1000.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the cost of i bananas and adds it to sum.
After the loop finishes, the code checks if sum is less than or equal to n. If it is, it prints 0, because the borrower does not need to borrow money. If sum is greater than n, it prints the difference between sum and n, which is the amount the borrower needs to borrow.
In this case, the total cost of bananas is 1000*1 + 1000*2 + 1000*3 + ... + 1000*1000 = 5005000000. Since this is less than 1000000000, the borrower does not need to borrow money, so the output is 0.
