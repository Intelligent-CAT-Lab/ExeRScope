The variable numbers is initialized to [100, 10000], which are the input values.
The variable start is initialized to 0.
The variable arr is initialized to an empty list, which will be used to store the strings.
The variable count is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of 'L's.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to numbers[0] (exclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 99.
For each number i in this range, it initializes an empty string.
The code then enters a nested loop that iterates from 0 to numbers[0] (exclusive).
For each number j in this range, it checks if count is less than numbers[1] (10000).
If it is, it checks if j is equal to next.
If it is, it appends 'L' to the string, increments count by 1, increments next by 2, and checks if next is greater than or equal to numbers[0] (100).
If it is, it sets start to 1 if start is 0, or to 0 if start is 1.
If it is not, it appends 'S' to the string.
If count is not less than numbers[1], it appends 'S' to the string.
After the nested loop finishes, it appends the string to arr.
After the outer loop finishes, it checks if count is less than numbers[1].
If it is, it prints 'NO'.
If it is not, it prints 'YES' and the strings in arr.
