The variable y is initialized to 2096.
The code then checks if the year y is a leap year using the isleap() function from the calendar module.
The code also gets the weekday of the first day of the year y using the weekday() function from the calendar module.
The code then enters a loop that continues indefinitely.
In each iteration of the loop, the code increments the year y by 1.
The code checks if the year y is a leap year and if its first day of the year is the same as the first day of the original year (2096).
If both conditions are met, the code prints the year y and breaks the loop.
The loop will continue until it finds a year that meets both conditions.
<<<Output>>>
2104
