<<<Analysis>>>
The variable A and variable B are initialized to 75 and 25, respectively.
The variable ans is calculated by subtracting twice the value of B from A. In this case, ans will be 75 - 2*25 = 75 - 50 = 25.
The code then checks if ans is less than 0. In this case, it is not, so the code does not enter the if block.
Finally, the code prints the value of ans, which is 25.
<<<Output>>>
25
