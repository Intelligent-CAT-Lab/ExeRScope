<<<Analysis>>>
The variable t and h are initialized to 8 and 8, respectively.
The code then calculates the integer division of (h - 2) by (t - 1) and adds 1 to the result.
The integer division operation (//) performs division in Python and rounds the result down to the nearest whole number.
In this case, the result of the division is 0, and adding 1 to it gives 1.
<<<Output>>>
1
