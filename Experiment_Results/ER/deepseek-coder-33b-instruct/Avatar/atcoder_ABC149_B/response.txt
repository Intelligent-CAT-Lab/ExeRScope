<<<Analysis>>>
The input is a string of three numbers separated by a space. The first two numbers are assigned to variables a and b, and the third number is assigned to k.
The code then calculates the result of a - k and stores it in res.
If res is less than 0, it means that a is less than k. In this case, a is set to 0 and b is increased by res. If b becomes less than 0 after this operation, it is set to 0.
If res is not less than 0, it means that a is greater than or equal to k. In this case, a is set to res.
Finally, the code prints the values of a and b.

<<<Output>>>
