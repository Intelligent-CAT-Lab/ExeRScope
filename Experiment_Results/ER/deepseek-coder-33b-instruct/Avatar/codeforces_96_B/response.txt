The code generates all numbers that can be formed by appending 4s and 7s to the end of a number. It uses a recursive function `gen` to generate these numbers. The function takes three parameters: the current number, the count of 4s in the number, and the count of 7s in the number.

The function first checks if the current number is greater than the limit. If it is, the function returns without doing anything.

Next, the function checks if the current number is greater than 0 and if the count of 4s is equal to the count of 7s. If both conditions are true, the function appends the current number to the list `l`.

The function then calls itself twice: once with a 4 appended to the end of the current number and the count of 4s incremented, and once with a 7 appended to the end of the current number and the count of 7s incremented.

The `main` function initializes the list `l` and calls the `gen` function with initial parameters of 0, 0, and 0. It then sorts the list `l` and reads an integer `n` from the input.

The function then iterates over the list `l` and checks if each number is greater than or equal to `n`. If it is, the function sets `ans` to the current number and breaks the loop.

Finally, the function prints `ans`.

Given the input `77777777`, the code will generate all numbers that can be formed by appending 4s and 7s to the end of a number, sort them, and then find the smallest number that is greater than or equal to `77777777`.
