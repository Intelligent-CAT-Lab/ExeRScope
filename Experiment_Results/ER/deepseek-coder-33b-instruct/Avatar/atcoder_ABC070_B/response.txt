<<<Analysis>>>
The variable a, b, c and d are initialized to 0, 50, 50 and 100, respectively.
The code then calculates the maximum of 0 and the minimum of b and d minus the maximum of a and c.
The minimum of b and d is 50, and the maximum of a and c is 50.
So, the code calculates the maximum of 0 and 50 - 50, which is 0.
The code then prints the final value, which is 0.
<<<Output>>>
0
