The variable K and variable N are initialized to 1 and 200000, respectively.
The variable mod is initialized to 998244353, which is a large prime number used for modular arithmetic.
The function inved is defined to calculate the modular multiplicative inverse of a number.
The list X is initialized to 0, with a length of 2*K-1.
The list frac is initialized to [1], and then it is filled with the factorial of numbers from 1 to N+K.
The list invf is initialized to an empty list, and then it is filled with the modular multiplicative inverse of the numbers in the frac list.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 2 to K+2 (exclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 2 to 3.
For each number k in this range, it calculates a sum S.
The code checks if k is even or odd. If it is even, it calculates the product of certain fractions and modular multiplicative inverses, and adds it to S. If it is odd, it subtracts the product from S.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final values of X, which are 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
