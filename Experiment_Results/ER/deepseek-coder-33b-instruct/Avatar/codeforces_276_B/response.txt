<<<Analysis>>>
The input string is converted into a list of characters. The variable x is initialized to True, which will be used to check if the string can be rearranged to form a palindrome. The dictionary dt is initialized to store the count of each character in the string.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each character in the string. For each character, it checks if it is already in the dictionary. If it is, it increments the count of that character. If it is not, it adds the character to the dictionary with a count of 1.
After the loop finishes, the code initializes a counter cnt to 0. It then enters another loop that iterates over each key-value pair in the dictionary. For each pair, it checks if the value (which is the count of the character) is odd. If it is, it increments the counter. If the counter is already 1, it sets x to False and breaks the loop.
After the loop finishes, the code checks the value of x. If x is True, it prints "First". If x is False and the length of the string is even, it prints "Second". If x is False and the length of the string is odd, it prints "First".
