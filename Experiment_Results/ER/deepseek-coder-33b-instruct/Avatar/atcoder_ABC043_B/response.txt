<<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized to the input string '0000000000'.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each character c in the string s.
For each character c, it checks if c is '0' or '1'. If it is, it adds c to my_str.
If c is 'B' and my_str is not empty, it removes the last character from my_str.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of my_str.
In this case, the input string does not contain 'B', so my_str remains the same as s, which is '0000000000'.
<<<Output>>>
0000000000
