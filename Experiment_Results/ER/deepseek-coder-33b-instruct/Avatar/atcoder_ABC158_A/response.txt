The input string "BBA" is stored in the variable stdin.
The string "BBA" is then copied to the variable s.
The code checks if both "A" and "B" are present in the string s. In this case, "A" is not present in "BBA", so the condition is not met.
Since the condition is not met, the string "No" is assigned to the variable result.
Finally, the code prints the value of result, which is "No".

<<<Output>>>
No
