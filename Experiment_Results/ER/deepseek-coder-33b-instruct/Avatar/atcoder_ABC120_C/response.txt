<<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized to "0", which is the input string.
The variables num_0 and num_1 are initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of 0s and 1s in the string.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each character in the string s.
For each character, it checks if the character is "0". If it is, it increments num_0 by 1. If it is not, it increments num_1 by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the minimum of num_0 and num_1 (which is num_0 in this case) multiplied by 2.
<<<Output>>>
0
