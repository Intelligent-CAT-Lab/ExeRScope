The input is a single character 'c'.
The function ord() returns an integer representing the Unicode character. The Unicode code point of 'c' is 99.
The code then adds 1 to this value, resulting in 100.
The function chr() returns a string representing a character whose Unicode code point is the integer. The Unicode character corresponding to 100 is 'd'.
The code then prints this character.
