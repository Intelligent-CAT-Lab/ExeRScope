<<<Analysis>>>
The variable a is initialized to 733035.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from a to 1 (inclusive), with a step of -1. This means it will consider numbers from 733035 down to 1.
For each number i in this range, it checks if a is divisible by i. If it is, it prints the current number i and then updates the value of a to i.
The condition is met when i is 733035, 11, 7, 5, 3, 1.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of a, which is 1.
<<<Output>>>
733035 11 7 5 3 1
