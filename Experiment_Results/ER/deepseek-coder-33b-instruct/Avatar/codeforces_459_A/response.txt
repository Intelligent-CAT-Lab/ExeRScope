<<<Analysis>>>
The variable anti, variable b, variable c and variable d are initialized to 4, 0, 0 and 4, respectively.
The variable l is initialized to the absolute difference between anti and c, which is 0.
The variable m is initialized to the absolute difference between b and d, which is 0.
The code then checks if anti is equal to c. If it is, it prints the values of anti + m, b, c + m and d.
The code then checks if b is equal to d. If it is, it prints the values of anti, b + l, c and d + l.
The code then checks if l is not equal to m. If it is, it prints -1.
The code then checks if l is equal to m. If it is, it prints the values of anti, d, c and b.
Since l is equal to m, the code prints the values of anti, d, c and b.
<<<Output>>>
