The variable A, B, C and D are initialized to 2, 1, 3 and 4, respectively.
The variable m is initialized to 998244353, which is a prime number used for modulo operation.
The variable d is a 2D list (matrix) initialized with zeros. The size of the matrix is (C+1) x (D+1).
The value of d[A][B] is set to 1.
The code then enters a nested loop that iterates from A to C (inclusive) and from B to D (inclusive).
For each pair of (i, j), it calculates a new value based on the previous values in the matrix. The new value is calculated as the sum of the previous values multiplied by i and j, minus the product of the previous values multiplied by (i-1) and (j-1). The result is then taken modulo m to keep it within the range of m.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of d[C][D], which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
