<<<Analysis>>>
The input is a string of three numbers: '5 5 7'. The map function is used to convert these numbers into integers and the tuple function is used to convert the map object into a tuple. The resulting tuple is stored in the variable ABC.
The code then checks if the count of the number 5 in the tuple ABC is equal to 2. In this case, it is not, because there is only one 5 in the tuple. Therefore, it prints 'NO'.
<<<Output>>>
NO
