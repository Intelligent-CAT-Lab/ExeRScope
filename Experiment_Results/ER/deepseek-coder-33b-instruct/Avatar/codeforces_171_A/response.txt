<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs, a and b, which are split by a space. The second input, b, is reversed by slicing it with a step of -1. This means the string is reversed.
The reversed string is then converted to an integer.
The first input, a, is converted to an integer.
The sum of these two integers is then printed.

The input given is '35005211 521595368'.
After splitting, a is '35005211' and b is '521595368'.
The reversed b is '863595125'.
These are then converted to integers, a is 35005211 and b is 863595125.
The sum of these two integers is 1213646336.

<<<Output>>>
1213646336
