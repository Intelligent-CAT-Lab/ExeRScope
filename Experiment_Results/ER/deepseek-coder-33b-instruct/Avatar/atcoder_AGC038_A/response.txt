<<<Analysis>>>
The input is given as 1000 1000 0 0.
The code first imports the sys module, which provides access to some variables used or maintained by the interpreter and to functions that interact strongly with the interpreter.
The function solve is defined, which takes four parameters: H, W, A, and B.
The function solve initializes a 2D list answer with dimensions H x W, filled with "0".
The function then iterates over each element in the 2D list.
For each element, it checks if the row index i is less than B and the column index j is less than A. If it is, it sets the element to "0". If it is not, it sets the element to "1".
If the row index i is greater than or equal to B and the column index j is less than A, it sets the element to "1". If it is not, it sets the element to "0".
Finally, it prints each row of the 2D list as a string, with no spaces between the elements.
The main function reads the input from the standard input, converts it to integers, and calls the solve function with these values.
Given the input 1000 1000 0 0, the function solve will set all elements of the 2D list to "0", because B is 0 and A is 0.
