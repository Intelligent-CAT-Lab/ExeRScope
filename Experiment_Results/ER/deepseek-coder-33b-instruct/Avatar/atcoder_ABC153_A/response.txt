<<<Analysis>>>
The variable h and variable a are initialized to 10000 and 1, respectively.
The code then calculates the ceiling of h divided by a. The ceiling function rounds up to the nearest integer. In this case, h/a is 10000.0, and the ceiling of this is 10000.
The code then prints the result, which is 10000.
<<<Output>>>
10000
