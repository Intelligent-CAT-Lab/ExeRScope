<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized to 9552.
The function hoge is defined to check if a number is prime. It returns True if the number is prime and False otherwise.
The function hoge checks if the number is 2, in which case it returns True. If the number is not 2, it checks if the number is divisible by any number from 2 to the square root of the number plus 2. If the number is divisible by any of these, it returns False. If the number is not divisible by any of these, it returns True.
The code then enters a loop that continues until it finds a prime number. If the number is not prime, it increments the number by 1 and checks again. If the number is prime, it prints the number and exits the program.
The first number that is not prime is 9553. The next prime number is 9557.
<<<Output>>>
9557
