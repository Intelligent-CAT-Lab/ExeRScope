<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 6.
The variables i and j are initialized to 1 and n*n, which is 36.
The code then enters a while loop that continues until i is not less than j.
In each iteration of the loop, the code prints the values of i and j, then increments i by 1 and decrements j by 1.
The loop will print the pairs (1, 36), (2, 35), (3, 34), (4, 33), (5, 32), (6, 31), (7, 30), (8, 29), (9, 28), (10, 27), (11, 26), (12, 25), (13, 24), (14, 23), (15, 22), (16, 21), (17, 20), (18, 19) and so on until i is no longer less than j.
