The variable a, b, h, and m are initialized to 1, 2, 9, and 49, respectively.
The variable theta_h is calculated by subtracting the angle of the hour hand from 2.5*pi. The angle of the hour hand is calculated by multiplying the fraction of the hour (including the fraction of the minute) by 2*pi and then subtracting it from 2.5*pi.
The variable theta_m is calculated in a similar way, but for the minute hand.
The variables x_h, y_h, x_m, and y_m are calculated by multiplying the lengths a and b by the cosine and sine of theta_h and theta_m, respectively.
Finally, the code prints the Euclidean distance between the points (x_h, y_h) and (x_m, y_m).
