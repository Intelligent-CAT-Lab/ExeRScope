The function cutRibbon takes an input of four integers, where the first integer is the length of the ribbon, and the next three integers are the possible lengths of the pieces that can be cut from the ribbon.
The function then sorts these three integers in ascending order.
The function checks if the length of the ribbon is divisible by the smallest piece length. If it is, it prints the quotient of the division and returns.
If the length of the ribbon is not divisible by the smallest piece length, it initializes a variable ans to 0.
If the smallest and second smallest piece lengths are equal, it iterates over the possible number of pieces of the smallest length that can be cut from the ribbon. For each iteration, it checks if the remaining length of the ribbon is divisible by the smallest piece length. If it is, it calculates the quotient of the division and updates ans if the quotient is greater than the current value of ans.
If the smallest and second smallest piece lengths are not equal, it iterates over the possible number of pieces of the smallest and second smallest lengths that can be cut from the ribbon. For each iteration, it checks if the remaining length of the ribbon is divisible by the smallest piece length. If it is, it calculates the quotient of the division and updates ans if the quotient is greater than the current value of ans.
Finally, it prints the value of ans, which is the maximum number of pieces that can be cut from the ribbon.
