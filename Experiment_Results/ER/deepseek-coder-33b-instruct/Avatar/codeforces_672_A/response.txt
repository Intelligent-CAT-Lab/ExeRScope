<<<Analysis>>>
The variable li is initialized as an empty list, which will be used to store the numbers.
The variable ind is initialized to 0, which is not used in the code.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 370 (inclusive).
For each number i in this range, it calculates the number of digits in i and stores it in count.
If count is 1, it appends i to the list li.
If count is 2 or 3, it creates a temporary list temp, and appends the digits of i in reverse order to temp. It then extends li with temp.
After the loop finishes, the code removes the last two elements from li.
The code then reads an integer n from the input.
Finally, it prints the n-th element of li (0-indexed).
