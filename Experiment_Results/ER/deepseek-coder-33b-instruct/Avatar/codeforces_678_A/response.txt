<<<Analysis>>>
The variable vamshi and z are initialized to 999999999 and 1, respectively.
The code then calculates the integer division of vamshi by z and adds 1, then multiplies the result by z.
The integer division of vamshi by z is 999999999, adding 1 gives 1000000000.
Multiplying this by z gives 1000000000.
<<<Output>>>
1000000000
