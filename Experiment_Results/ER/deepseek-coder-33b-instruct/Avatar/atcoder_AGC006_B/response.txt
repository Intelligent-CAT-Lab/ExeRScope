<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N and x are initialized to 2 and 1, respectively.
The code then checks if x is equal to 1 or 2*N - 1. In this case, it is not, so it prints "Yes".
Then it creates a list l of integers from 1 to 2*N - 1.
It removes the elements at indices x - 1, x, and x + 1 from the list.
Then it prints the first N - 2 elements of the list, followed by x - 1, x, and x + 1.
Then it prints the last N - 2 elements of the list.
<<<Output>>>
