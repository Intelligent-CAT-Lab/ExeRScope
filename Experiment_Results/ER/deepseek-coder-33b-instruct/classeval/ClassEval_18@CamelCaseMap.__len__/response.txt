In the `test()` method, a new instance of `CamelCaseMap` is created and assigned to the variable `camelize_map`.

Then, the `__setitem__` method is called on `camelize_map` with the key `'first_name'` and the value `'John'`. This method calls the `_convert_key` method on the key, which in this case converts the key to camel case (`'firstName'`). The key-value pair is then added to the `_data` dictionary of `camelize_map`.

Finally, the `__len__` method is called on `camelize_map`, which returns the number of items in the `_data` dictionary. Since there is only one item in the dictionary (`'firstName': 'John'`), the `__len__` method returns `1`.

<<<Analysis>>>
The `test()` method creates a new instance of `CamelCaseMap` and adds a key-value pair to it. Then, it returns the length of the `_data` dictionary, which is `1`.
