<<<Analysis>>>
In the test() method, an instance of SQLGenerator is created with the table name 'table1'.
The insert() method is then called on this instance with a dictionary of data. The dictionary contains five key-value pairs, where the keys are the field names and the values are the corresponding field values.
The insert() method constructs an SQL INSERT statement. It first joins all the keys in the dictionary with a comma and space to form the fields part of the statement. It then joins all the values in the dictionary with a comma and a single quote to form the values part of the statement.
The constructed SQL statement is then returned by the insert() method.
<<<Output>>>
"INSERT INTO table1 (field1, field2, field3, field4, field5) VALUES ('value1', 'value2', 'value3', 'value4', 'value5');"
