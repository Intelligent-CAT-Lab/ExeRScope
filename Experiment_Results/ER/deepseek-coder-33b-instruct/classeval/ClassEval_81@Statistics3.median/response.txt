<<<Analysis>>>
In the test() method, an instance of the Statistics3 class is created and the median() method is invoked with the list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] as an argument.
The median() method sorts the input list and then checks if the length of the list is odd or even. If it's odd, it returns the middle element. If it's even, it returns the average of the two middle elements.
In this case, the list is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8], which has an odd length of 8. The middle element is at index 8//2 = 4, which is 5.
<<<Output>>>
5
