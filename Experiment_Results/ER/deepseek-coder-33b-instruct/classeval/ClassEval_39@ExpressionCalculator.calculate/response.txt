In the `Test.test()` method, an instance of `ExpressionCalculator` is created and the `calculate()` method is called with the expression "2 * 3 * 4".

The `calculate()` method first transforms the expression using the `transform()` method. The `transform()` method replaces all whitespaces in the expression and removes any equals sign at the end of the expression. It also replaces all minus signs that are not part of a number with a tilde (~).

After the transformation, the `calculate()` method prepares the expression for calculation by calling the `prepare()` method. The `prepare()` method converts the infix expression to postfix notation.

The `prepare()` method uses a stack to keep track of operators. It iterates over the transformed expression, and for each character, if it is an operator, it compares it with the top of the stack. If the top of the stack has higher or equal priority, it pops the top of the stack and appends it to the postfix stack. Then it pushes the current operator to the stack. If the current operator is a closing parenthesis, it pops operators from the stack and appends them to the postfix stack until it encounters an opening parenthesis.

After preparing the expression, the `calculate()` method calculates the result by iterating over the postfix stack. If the current item is a number, it pushes it to the result stack. If the current item is an operator, it pops two numbers from the result stack, calculates the result, and pushes the result back to the result stack.

Finally, the `calculate()` method joins the numbers in the result stack with multiplication and evaluates the result.
