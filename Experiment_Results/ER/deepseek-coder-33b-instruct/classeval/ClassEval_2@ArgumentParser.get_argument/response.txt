<<<Analysis>>>
In the test() method, an instance of ArgumentParser is created and assigned to self.parser. The arguments dictionary is then populated with two key-value pairs: "name" mapped to "John" and "age" mapped to 25.
The get_argument() method is then called with "age" as the argument. This method retrieves the value associated with the key "age" from the arguments dictionary.
In this case, the value associated with "age" is 25.
<<<Output>>>
25
