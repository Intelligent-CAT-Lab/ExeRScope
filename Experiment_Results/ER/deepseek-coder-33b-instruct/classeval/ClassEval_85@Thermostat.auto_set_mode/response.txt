<<<Analysis>>>
In the test() method, a Thermostat object `t` is created with current temperature 25, target temperature 25, and mode 'cool'.
The `auto_set_mode()` method is called on `t`. This method checks if the current temperature is less than the target temperature. If it is, the mode is set to 'heat'. If it's not, the mode is set to 'cool'.
In this case, the current temperature is equal to the target temperature, so the mode is set to 'cool'.
Then, the `get_mode()` method is called on `t`, which returns the current mode of `t`.
<<<Output>>>
'cool'
