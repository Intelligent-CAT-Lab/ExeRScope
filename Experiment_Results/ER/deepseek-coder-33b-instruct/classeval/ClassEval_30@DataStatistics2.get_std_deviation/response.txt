In the test() method, a DataStatistics2 object is created with the data [1, 2, 3, 4].
The get_std_deviation() method is then called on this object.
The purpose of this method is to calculate the standard deviation of the data.
The standard deviation is the square root of the variance.
The variance is calculated by np.var(self.data), which returns the variance of the data.
The variance is then rounded to 2 decimal places using round(np.var(self.data), 2).
The standard deviation is then calculated by taking the square root of the variance, which is np.sqrt(np.var(self.data)).
The result is then rounded to 2 decimal places using round(np.sqrt(np.var(self.data)), 2).
The method returns the rounded standard deviation.
In this case, the data is [1, 2, 3, 4], the variance is 1.25, the standard deviation is 1.12, and the rounded standard deviation is 1.12.

<<<Output>>>
1.12
