<<<Analysis>>>
In the test() method, an instance of the AreaCalculator class is created with a radius of 0. Then the calculate_annulus_area() method is called with inner_radius=1 and outer_radius=3.
The calculate_annulus_area() method calculates the area of an annulus (a ring-shaped area) given the inner and outer radii. The formula for the area of an annulus is π(R² - r²), where R is the outer radius and r is the inner radius.
In this case, the area of the annulus is π(3² - 1²) = 9π.
<<<Output>>>
9π
