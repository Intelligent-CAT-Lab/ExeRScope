In the test() method, the DataStatistics4.kurtosis([1, 5, 3]) method is invoked. The purpose of this method is to calculate the kurtosis of a given data set. In this case, the data set is [1, 5, 3].

The kurtosis is a measure of the "tailedness" of the probability distribution of a real-valued random variable. In a Leptokurtic distribution, the tails of the distribution are fatter than the distribution of a normal distribution.

The kurtosis is calculated as follows:

1. Calculate the mean of the data set.
2. Calculate the standard deviation of the data set.
3. Subtract the mean from each data point and square the result.
4. Calculate the mean of these squared differences.
5. Take the square root of the result from step 4.
6. Divide the result from step 3 by the result from step 5.
7. Subtract 3 from the result from step 6.

In the given data set [1, 5, 3], the mean is 3, the standard deviation is sqrt(10/3) ~= 1.63, and the fourth moment is (1^4 + 5^4 + 3^4) / 3 = 96.

So, the kurtosis is (96 / 1.63^4) - 3 = 1.33 - 3 = -1.67.

<<<Output>>>
-1.67
