<<<Analysis>>>
In the `test()` method, an instance of `ArgumentParser` is created and assigned to `self.parser`. The `command_str` is a string that represents a command line input. The `add_argument()` method is called twice to add two arguments to the parser. The first argument is "name" and it is not required. The second argument is "age" and it is required and its type is int.

The `parse_arguments()` method is then called with `command_str` as the argument. This method splits `command_str` into a list of arguments. It then iterates over this list, checking if each argument starts with '--' or '-'. If it does, it extracts the key and value (if present) and adds them to the `self.arguments` dictionary. If the argument is required and not present in `self.arguments`, it adds it to the `missing_args` set.

Finally, it checks if there are any missing arguments. If there are, it returns `False` and the `missing_args` set. If there aren't, it returns `True` and `None`.

In this case, the `command_str` is "script --name=John". The `parse_arguments()` method splits this into ["script", "--name=John"]. It then iterates over this list, extracting the key and value from "--name=John". It adds "name" and "John" to `self.arguments`. It then checks if there are any missing arguments. Since "age" is required and not in `self.arguments`, it adds "age" to `missing_args`. Finally, it returns `False` and `missing_args`.

<<<Output>>>
(False, {'age'})
