In the `test()` method, the following steps are performed:
1. An instance of `MovieBookingSystem` is created and assigned to `self.system`.
2. A movie is added to the system using the `add_movie()` method. The movie's name is 'Batman', price is 29.9, start time is '17:05', end time is '19:25', and the number of seats in each row and column is 3.
3. The number of movies in the system, the name of the first movie, the price of the first movie, the start time of the first movie, the end time of the first movie, and the shape of the seats of the first movie are returned.

<<<Output>>>
