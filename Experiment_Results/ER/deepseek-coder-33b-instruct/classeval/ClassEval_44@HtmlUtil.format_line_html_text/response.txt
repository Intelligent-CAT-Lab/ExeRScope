In the `test()` method of the `Test` class, an instance of `HtmlUtil` is created and the `format_line_html_text()` method is called with the input string `'<p>Some sentence here.</p>'`.

The `format_line_html_text()` method takes an HTML text as input and formats it according to certain rules. It uses the BeautifulSoup library to parse the HTML and manipulate the elements.

The method first checks if the input text is None or empty. If it is, it returns an empty string.

Next, it finds all 'pre' and 'blockquote' tags in the HTML and replaces their text with the string '-CODE-'. This is done to mark code snippets in the text.

Then, it finds all 'ul' and 'ol' tags and formats their list items. If the last character of a list item is a punctuation mark, it adds a hyphen and a space before the item. If it's not, it adds a hyphen, a period, and a space.

Next, it finds all 'p' tags and formats their text. If the last character of a paragraph is a punctuation mark, it leaves the text as is. If it's not, and the next sibling of the paragraph is a code snippet, it adds a colon after the paragraph. If it's not, it adds a period after the paragraph.

Finally, it decodes HTML entities in the text and formats line feeds using the `__format_line_feed()` method.

In this case, the input string `'<p>Some sentence here.</p>'` does not contain any 'pre', 'blockquote', 'ul', 'ol', or 'p' tags, so the method will return the same string after formatting line feeds.

<<<Output>>>
'Some sentence here.'
