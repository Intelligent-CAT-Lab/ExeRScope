<<<Analysis>>>
In the test() method, an instance of the RegexUtils class is created and assigned to the variable `ru`.
The `split()` method of the `ru` object is then called with two arguments: a regular expression pattern and a string.
The pattern `r'\b\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}\b'` is a regular expression that matches a phone number in the format "123-456-7890".
The string `"123456-7890 abiguygusu 876-286-9876 kjgufwycs 987-762-9767"` contains several phone numbers.
The `split()` method splits the string at each occurrence of the pattern, returning a list of substrings.
In this case, the method will return `['123456-7890 abiguygusu 876-286-9876 kjgufwycs ', ' ', '']`.
The first element is the part of the string before the first phone number, the second element is the part between the first and second phone numbers, and the third element is the part after the second phone number.
<<<Output>>>
['123456-7890 abiguygusu 876-286-9876 kjgufwycs ', ' ', '']
