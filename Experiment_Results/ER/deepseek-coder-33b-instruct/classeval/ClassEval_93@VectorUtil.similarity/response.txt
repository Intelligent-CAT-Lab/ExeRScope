In the `Test.test()` method, two vectors `vector_1` and `vector_2` are defined as numpy arrays. These vectors are then passed to the `VectorUtil.similarity()` method.

The `VectorUtil.similarity()` method calculates the cosine similarity between two vectors. The cosine similarity is a measure of similarity between two non-zero vectors of an inner product space. It is defined as the cosine of the angle between them, which is also the inner product of the same vectors normalized to both have length 1.

In the `VectorUtil.similarity()` method, the `matutils.unitvec()` function is used to normalize the input vectors. This function divides each element of the input vector by the L2 norm of the vector.

In the `Test.test()` method, the vectors `vector_1` and `vector_2` are both [1, 1]. After normalization, they become [1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)].

The dot product of these two vectors is calculated as follows:

dot_product = (1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(2)) + (1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(2)) = 1

So, the return value of `Test.test()` is 1.
