<<<Analysis>>>
In the test() method, a Snake object is created with the parameters (100, 100, 1, (51, 51)). This means the screen width and height are 100, the block size is 1, and the initial food position is (51, 51).

The move() method is then called with the parameter (-1, 0). This means the snake is moving to the left. The new position of the snake is calculated by adding the product of the direction and the block size to the current position, and then taking the modulus of the screen width and height to ensure the snake stays within the screen. If the new position is the same as the food position, the snake eats the food. If the new position is in the positions list (excluding the first position), the snake resets. Otherwise, the new position is added to the front of the positions list and the last position is removed.

After the move, the reset() method is called, which resets the snake's length, positions, and score. The length is set to 1, the positions list is set to a list containing the center of the screen, and the score is set to 0. The food position is then randomly set to a new position that is not in the positions list.

Finally, the test() method returns a tuple containing the snake's length, the first position in the positions list, and the score.

<<<Output>>>
(1, (50.0, 50.0), 0)
