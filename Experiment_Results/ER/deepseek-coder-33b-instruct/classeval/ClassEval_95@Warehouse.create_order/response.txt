In the test() method, a new Warehouse object is created.
The add_product() method is called with product_id=1, name='product 4', and quantity=5. This method adds a new product to the inventory dictionary with the given product_id, name, and quantity.
The create_order() method is then called with order_id=1, product_id=1, and quantity=5. This method checks if there is enough quantity of the product in the inventory. If there is, it updates the product quantity in the inventory and creates an order in the orders dictionary with the given order_id, product_id, quantity, and status 'Shipped'.
The orders dictionary is then returned by the test() method.

<<<Output>>>
{'1': {'product_id': 1, 'quantity': 5, 'status': 'Shipped'}}
