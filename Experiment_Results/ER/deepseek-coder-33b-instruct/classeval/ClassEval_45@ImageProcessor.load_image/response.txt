In the test() method, an instance of the ImageProcessor class is created and assigned to the variable self.processor.
The image_path is set to the path of a test image file named "test.png" in the same directory as the current file.
A new image of size 100x100 is created with all pixels set to white (255, 255, 255) and saved to the image_path.
The load_image() method of the ImageProcessor instance is called with the image_path as the argument, loading the image from the file.
The return statement returns the format of the image that was loaded.

The format of the image is determined by the file extension of the image file. In this case, since the image file is named "test.png", the format of the image is "PNG".

<<<Output>>>
'PNG'
