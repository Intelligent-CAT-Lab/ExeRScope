<<<Analysis>>>
In the test() method, a FitnessTracker object is created with the parameters height=1.72, weight=65, age=20, sex="male".
The get_BMI() method is then called on this object.
The get_BMI() method calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) of the person. The formula for BMI is weight / height^2.
In this case, BMI = 65 / 1.72^2 = 22.09.
So, the return value of the test() method is 22.09.

<<<Output>>>
22.09
