<<<Analysis>>>
In the test() method, an instance of the BoyerMooreSearch class is created with the text "ABAABA" and the pattern "ABC".
The method mismatch_in_text(3) is then called on this instance.
The mismatch_in_text() method takes an integer argument currentPos, which is 3 in this case.
The method then iterates over the pattern from the end to the start.
For each character in the pattern, it checks if the character at the current position in the text is not equal to the character in the pattern.
If it finds a mismatch, it returns the current position in the text plus the current index in the pattern.
In this case, the pattern is "ABC", the text is "ABAABA", and the current position is 3.
The first character in the pattern is "C", which does not match the character at the current position in the text, which is "B".
So, the method returns 3 + 0 = 3.
<<<Output>>>
3
