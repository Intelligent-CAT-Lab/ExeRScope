<<<Analysis>>>
In the `test()` method of the `Test` class, the following steps are performed:

1. The database name is set to "test.db".
2. An instance of the `DatabaseProcessor` class is created with the database name as an argument.
3. A table named "test_table4" is created with keys 'name' and 'age'.
4. A connection to the database is established.
5. A SQL query is executed to select the name of the table from the database.
6. The result of the query is fetched and stored in the `result` variable.
7. The connection to the database is closed.
8. The `result`, `result[0]` (which is the name of the table), and `table_name` are returned.

<<<Output>>>
('test_table4', 'test_table4', 'test_table4')
