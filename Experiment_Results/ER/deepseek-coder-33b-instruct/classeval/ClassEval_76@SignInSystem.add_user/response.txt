<<<Analysis>>>
In the test() method, a new instance of the SignInSystem class is created and assigned to the variable signin_system.
Then, the add_user() method is called on signin_system with the argument "ccc". This method checks if "ccc" is already a key in the users dictionary. If it is, the method returns False. If it's not, it adds "ccc" to the dictionary with a value of False and returns True.
In this case, "ccc" is not a key in the users dictionary, so the add_user() method adds "ccc" to the dictionary with a value of False and returns True.
<<<Output>>>
True
