<<<Analysis>>>
In the `test()` method, an instance of the `JobMarketplace` class is created. Then, the `submit_resume()` method is called with the arguments "Tom", ['skill1', 'skill2'], and "experience". This method creates a dictionary with the provided arguments and appends it to the `resumes` list in the `JobMarketplace` instance.

The `submit_resume()` method doesn't return anything, so the `test()` method returns the `resumes` list after the `submit_resume()` method is called.

The `resumes` list contains a dictionary with the provided arguments. The dictionary has three keys: "name", "skills", and "experience". The value of "name" is "Tom", the value of "skills" is a list with two elements: 'skill1' and 'skill2', and the value of "experience" is "experience".

<<<Output>>>
[{'name': 'Tom', 'skills': ['skill1', 'skill2'], 'experience': 'experience'}]
