<<<Analysis>>>
In the `test()` method, the following steps are performed:
1. An instance of `StudentDatabaseProcessor` is created with the database name "test_database.db".
2. The `create_student_table()` method is called to create a table named "students" in the database if it doesn't already exist.
3. A dictionary `student_data` is created with student details.
4. The `insert_student()` method is called to insert the student data into the "students" table.
5. A connection to the database is established.
6. A SELECT query is executed to fetch the details of the student with name 'bbb'.
7. The connection is closed.
8. The method returns a tuple containing the length of the result (which is the number of students with name 'bbb') and the name of the first student in the result.

<<<Output>>>
(1, 'bbb')
