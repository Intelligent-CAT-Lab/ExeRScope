In the `test()` method, a `StockPortfolioTracker` object is created with an initial cash balance of 10000.0. The portfolio is then set to contain one stock, 'AAPL', with a price of 150.0 and a quantity of 10.

The `get_portfolio_summary()` method is then called on this object. This method calculates the total value of the portfolio by summing the cash balance and the value of each stock in the portfolio. The value of each stock is calculated by calling the `get_stock_value()` method, which multiplies the price of the stock by the quantity.

In this case, the portfolio contains one stock, 'AAPL', with a price of 150.0 and a quantity of 10. The value of this stock is 150.0 * 10 = 1500.0.

The total portfolio value is then calculated by adding the cash balance (10000.0) to the value of the stock (1500.0), which gives a total portfolio value of 11500.0.

The `get_portfolio_summary()` method also generates a summary of the portfolio, which is a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary contains the name and value of a stock in the portfolio. In this case, the summary will be `[{'name': 'AAPL', 'value': 1500.0}]`.

Finally, the `get_portfolio_summary()` method returns a tuple containing the total portfolio value and the summary. In this case, the return value will be `(11500.0, [{'name': 'AAPL', 'value': 1500.0}])`.

<<<Output>>>
(11500.0, [{'name': 'AAPL', 'value': 1500.0}])
