<<<Analysis>>>
In the `test()` method of the `Test` class, a `TextFileProcessor` object is created with a file path 'test.txt'. The `read_file` and `write_file` methods of the `TextFileProcessor` object are mocked. The `read_file` method is mocked to return a specific string 'Hello, 123 World!'. The `write_file` method is mocked to do nothing.

The `process_file` method of the `TextFileProcessor` object is then called. This method reads the content of the file, removes all non-alphabet characters from the content, and writes the processed content back to the file.

The `read_file` method is expected to be called once. The `write_file` method is expected to be called once with the expected result 'HelloWorld'.

The `process_file` method returns the processed content, which is 'HelloWorld'.

<<<Output>>>
('HelloWorld', 'HelloWorld')
