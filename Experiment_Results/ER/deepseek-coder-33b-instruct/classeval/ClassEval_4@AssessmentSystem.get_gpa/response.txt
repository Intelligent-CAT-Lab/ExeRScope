<<<Analysis>>>
In the test() method, an instance of the AssessmentSystem class is created and a student named 'Alice' is added to the system. The student's grade, major, and course with their respective scores are also added.

The get_gpa() method is then called with the argument 'Bob'. This method calculates the GPA (Grade Point Average) of a student. The GPA is calculated as the sum of all the scores of the student divided by the number of courses.

In this case, 'Bob' is not a student in the system, so the get_gpa() method will return None.

<<<Output>>>
None
