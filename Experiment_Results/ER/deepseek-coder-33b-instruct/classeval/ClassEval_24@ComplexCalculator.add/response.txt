<<<Analysis>>>
In the test() method, a ComplexCalculator object is created and the add() method is invoked with two complex numbers as arguments.
The add() method takes two complex numbers as input and returns their sum.
The real part of the sum is the sum of the real parts of the input complex numbers.
The imaginary part of the sum is the sum of the imaginary parts of the input complex numbers.
In this case, the input complex numbers are (1 + 2j) and (3 + 4j).
The real part of the sum is 1 + 3 = 4.
The imaginary part of the sum is 2 + 4 = 6.
So, the sum of the two complex numbers is (4 + 6j).
<<<Output>>>
(4+6j)
