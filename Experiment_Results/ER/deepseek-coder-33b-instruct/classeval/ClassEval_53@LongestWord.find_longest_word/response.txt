<<<Analysis>>>
In the test() method, an instance of the LongestWord class is created and a word "a" is added to its word_list. Then, the find_longest_word() method is called with a sentence "I am a student.".

The find_longest_word() method takes a sentence as input. It first converts the sentence to lowercase and removes all punctuation from it. Then, it splits the sentence into a list of words.

For each word in the list, it checks if the word is in the word_list of the LongestWord instance and if its length is greater than the length of the current longest_word. If both conditions are true, it updates the longest_word.

In this case, the word_list only contains the word "a". The sentence "I am a student." is split into the words ['i', 'am', 'a', 'student']. The word "a" is in the word_list and its length is 1, which is greater than the length of the current longest_word, "", so the longest_word is updated to "a".

After checking all words, the method returns the longest_word, which is "a".

<<<Output>>>
"a"
