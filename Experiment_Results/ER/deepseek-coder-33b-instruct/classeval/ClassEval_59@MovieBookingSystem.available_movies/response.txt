In the `test()` method, an instance of the `MovieBookingSystem` class is created and assigned to the variable `self.system`.

Two movies are added to the system using the `add_movie()` method. The first movie is 'Batman' with a price of 49.9, a start time of '17:05', an end time of '19:25', and 3 seats. The second movie is 'Spiderman' with a price of 59.9, a start time of '20:00', an end time of '22:30', and 4 seats.

The `available_movies()` method is then called with the start time of '20:00' and the end time of '23:00'. This method returns a list of movie names that are available within the given time range.

The `available_movies()` method iterates over all movies in the system. For each movie, it checks if the movie's start time is less than or equal to the given end time and if the movie's end time is greater than or equal to the given start time. If both conditions are true, the movie's name is added to the list of available movies.

In this case, the 'Spiderman' movie is available within the given time range ('20:00' to '23:00'), so the `available_movies()` method returns a list with 'Spiderman' as the only element.

<<<Output>>>
['Spiderman']
