In the test() method, a SignInSystem object is created.
The add_user() method is called with "user1" as the argument. This method checks if "user1" is already in the users dictionary. Since it's not, it adds "user1" to the dictionary with a value of False, indicating that the user is not signed in.
The sign_in() method is then called with "user1" as the argument. This method checks if "user1" is in the users dictionary. Since it is, it sets the value of "user1" to True, indicating that the user is signed in.
Finally, the check_sign_in() method is called with "user1" as the argument. This method checks if "user1" is in the users dictionary. Since it is, it returns the value of "user1", which is True.
<<<Output>>>
True
