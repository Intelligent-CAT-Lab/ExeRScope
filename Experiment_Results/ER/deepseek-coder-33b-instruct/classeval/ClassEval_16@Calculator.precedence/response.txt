In the `test()` method, two calls are made to the `precedence()` method of the `Calculator` class. The `precedence()` method takes an operator as input and returns its precedence. The precedence of an operator determines the order in which operations are performed in an expression.

The `precedence()` method first defines a dictionary `precedences` that maps each operator to its precedence. The precedence of '+' and '-' is 1, the precedence of '*', '/' and '^' is 2, and the precedence of '^' is 3.

In the `test()` method, the `precedence()` method is called with '+' and '-' as arguments. The `precedence()` method returns the corresponding precedence from the `precedences` dictionary.

So, the return value of `Test.test()` will be a tuple `(1, 1)`.
