In the `test()` method, an instance of `EmailClient` is created for both the sender and the receiver. The sender's capacity is 100 and the receiver's capacity is 50.

The `fetch()` method is then called on the receiver. This method checks if the receiver's inbox is empty. If it is, it returns `None`. If it's not, it iterates over the inbox and returns the first unread email it finds. If there are no unread emails, it returns `None`.

In this case, the receiver's inbox is empty, so `None` is returned.

<<<Output>>>
None
