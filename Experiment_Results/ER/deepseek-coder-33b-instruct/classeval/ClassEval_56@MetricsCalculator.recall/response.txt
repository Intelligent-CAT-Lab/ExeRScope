In the test() method, a MetricsCalculator object mc is created. Then, the recall() method is called on mc with two lists as arguments. The first list is the predicted labels and the second list is the true labels.

The recall() method first calls the update() method, which updates the true_positives, false_positives, false_negatives, and true_negatives attributes of the MetricsCalculator object based on the predicted and true labels.

In this case, the predicted labels are [1, 1, 0, 1] and the true labels are [1, 0, 0, 1]. The update() method will iterate through each pair of predicted and true labels, incrementing the appropriate attribute for each pair.

After the update() method is called, the recall() method calculates the recall. Recall is calculated as true_positives / (true_positives + false_negatives). In this case, true_positives is 1 (since there is one pair where the predicted and true labels are both 1) and false_negatives is 1 (since there is one pair where the predicted label is 0 and the true label is 1).

So, the recall is 1 / (1 + 1) = 0.5.

<<<Output>>>
0.5
