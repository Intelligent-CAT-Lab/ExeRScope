In the test() method, the SQLQueryBuilder.select() method is invoked. The purpose of this method is to generate a SQL SELECT query.
The method takes three parameters: table, columns, and where.
- table: The name of the table to select from. In this case, 'students'.
- columns: The columns to select. In this case, ['id', 'name']. The method joins these into a string with ', ' as the separator.
- where: The conditions for the WHERE clause. In this case, {'age': 18}. The method generates a string with ' AND ' as the separator, where each key-value pair is formatted as 'key=value'.

The method starts by checking if columns is not equal to '*'. If it is not, it joins the columns into a string with ', ' as the separator.
Then, it constructs the SELECT query by concatenating the SELECT clause, the columns, the FROM clause, and the table name.
If where is not None, it adds the WHERE clause to the query, joining the conditions with ' AND '.
Finally, it returns the query.

<<<Output>>>
SELECT id, name FROM students WHERE age='18'
