<<<Analysis>>>
In the test() method, a DataStatistics2 object is created with the data [1, 2, 3, 4].
The get_sum() method is then called on this object.
The get_sum() method calculates the sum of the data in the DataStatistics2 object.
The np.sum() function is used to calculate the sum of the data.
In this case, the data is [1, 2, 3, 4], so the sum is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
