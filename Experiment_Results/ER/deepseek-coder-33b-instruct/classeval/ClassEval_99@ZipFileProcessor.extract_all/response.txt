<<<Analysis>>>
In the `test()` method of the `Test` class, the following steps are performed:

1. A test folder named 'test_folder' is created.
2. An example file named 'example1.txt' is created in the test folder.
3. A zip file named 'example.zip' is created and the 'example1.txt' file is added to it.
4. An instance of `ZipFileProcessor` is created with the zip file name as the argument.
5. The `extract_all()` method of the `ZipFileProcessor` instance is called to extract all files from the zip file to an output directory named 'output_directory'.
6. The zip file and the example file are removed.
7. The test folder is removed.
8. The method returns a tuple with two values:
   - The first value is the result of the `extract_all()` method call. This will be `True` if the files were successfully extracted, and `False` otherwise.
   - The second value is a boolean indicating whether the extracted file exists in the output directory. This will be `True` if the file exists, and `False` otherwise.
