<<<Analysis>>>
In the test() method, an instance of the HRManagementSystem class is created and assigned to the variable hr_system.
The employees dictionary of hr_system is then updated with an employee with employee_id 1.
The remove_employee() method is then called on hr_system with employee_id 1 as the argument.
This method checks if the employee_id is in the employees dictionary. If it is, it deletes the employee from the dictionary and returns True. If it is not, it returns False.
In this case, the employee_id 1 is in the employees dictionary, so the employee with employee_id 1 is deleted from the dictionary.
The method then returns a tuple containing the result of the remove_employee() method call and the updated employees dictionary.
<<<Output>>>
(True, {})
