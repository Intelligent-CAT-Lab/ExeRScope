<<<Analysis>>>
In the `test()` method of the `Test` class, an instance of `TimeUtils` is created. This instance is stored in the variable `timeutils`.

The `add_seconds()` method of the `timeutils` instance is called with the argument `300`. This method adds the specified number of seconds to the current datetime stored in the `timeutils` instance. The result is then formatted as a string in the format "%H:%M:%S" and returned.

The second part of the return statement is a direct calculation of the time 300 seconds from the current time. It does this by adding a `datetime.timedelta` object representing 300 seconds to the current datetime, and then formatting this new datetime as a string in the format "%H:%M:%S".

The `add_seconds()` method and the calculation in the second part of the return statement both return the same result, which is the time 300 seconds from the current time.

<<<Output>>>
('HH:MM:SS', 'HH:MM:SS')
