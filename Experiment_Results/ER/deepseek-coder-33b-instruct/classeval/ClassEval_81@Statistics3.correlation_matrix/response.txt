In the `test()` method, an instance of the `Statistics3` class is created and the `correlation_matrix()` method is invoked with a list of lists as input.

The `correlation_matrix()` method calculates the correlation between each pair of columns in the input data. It first initializes an empty matrix. Then, for each column in the data, it calculates the correlation with every other column. The correlation is calculated using the `correlation()` method, which takes two lists of numbers as input and returns the correlation coefficient.

The `correlation()` method calculates the correlation coefficient between two lists of numbers. It first calculates the mean of each list, then calculates the numerator and denominator of the correlation formula. The correlation coefficient is the ratio of the numerator and the square root of the denominator.

In this case, the input data is a list of 5 lists, each with 3 elements. The `correlation_matrix()` method will calculate the correlation between each pair of columns. The output will be a 3x3 matrix, where each element is the correlation between two columns.
