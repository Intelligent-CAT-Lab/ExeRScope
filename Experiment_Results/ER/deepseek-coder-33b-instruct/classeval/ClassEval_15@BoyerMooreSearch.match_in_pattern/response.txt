In the test() method, a BoyerMooreSearch object is created with the text "ABAABA" and the pattern "ABAB". The match_in_pattern() method is then called with 'B' as the argument.

The match_in_pattern() method iterates over the pattern from the end to the start. For each character in the pattern, it checks if the character is equal to the input character. If it is, it returns the index of the character in the pattern.

In this case, the input character is 'B'. The method checks the pattern from the end to the start. When it encounters 'B' in the pattern, it returns the index of 'B', which is 1.
