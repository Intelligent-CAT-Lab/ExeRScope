In the `Test.test()` method, an instance of `ExcelProcessor` is created and the `read_excel()` method is invoked with an empty string as the file name. The `read_excel()` method is designed to read an Excel file and return its data.

In the `read_excel()` method, it tries to load the workbook from the given file name. If the file does not exist or cannot be opened, it will raise an exception and return None.

In this case, since the file name is an empty string, it will raise an exception and return None.

<<<Output>>>
None
