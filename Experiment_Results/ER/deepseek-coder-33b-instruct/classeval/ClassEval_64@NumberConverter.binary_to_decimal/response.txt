In the test() method, the NumberConverter.binary_to_decimal('1010010111010110111') method is invoked. The purpose of this method is to convert a binary number to a decimal number. In this case, the binary number is '1010010111010110111'.
The binary_to_decimal() method uses the int() function to convert the binary number to a decimal number. The int() function takes two arguments: the binary number as a string and the base of the number (in this case, 2 for binary).
The int() function converts the binary number to a decimal number and returns it.
