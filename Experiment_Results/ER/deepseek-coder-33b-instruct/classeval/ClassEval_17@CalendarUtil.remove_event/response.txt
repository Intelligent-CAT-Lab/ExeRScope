<<<Analysis>>>
In the `test()` method, a new instance of `CalendarUtil` is created and assigned to the variable `calendar`.

The `events` attribute of `calendar` is then set to a list of two events. Each event is represented as a dictionary with keys 'date', 'start_time', 'end_time', and 'description'.

The `remove_event()` method is then called on `calendar`, with the argument being a dictionary representing the second event in the list. This method checks if the event is in the `events` list, and if it is, it removes it.

Finally, the `events` attribute of `calendar` is returned.

<<<Output>>>
[{'date': datetime(2023, 1, 1, 0, 0), 'start_time': datetime(2023, 1, 1, 0, 0), 'end_time': datetime(2023, 1, 1, 22, 0), 'description': 'New Year'}]
