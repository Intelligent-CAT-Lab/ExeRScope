<<<Analysis>>>
In the `Test.test()` method, an instance of the `MahjongConnect` class is created with a board size of 4x4 and icons 'a', 'b', and 'c'. The board is then manually set to a specific configuration.

The `is_game_over()` method checks if the game is over. It does this by iterating over each row in the board. If it finds a cell that is not empty (' '), it returns False, indicating that the game is not over. If it goes through all the cells without finding any that are not empty, it returns True, indicating that the game is over.

In this specific case, the board is set to:
[[' ', ' ', ' ', ' '],
 ['a', ' ', ' ', ' '],
 [' ', ' ', ' ', ' '],
 [' ', ' ', ' ', ' ']]

The first row is all empty, but the second row has an 'a'. Therefore, the game is not over, and the method should return False.

<<<Output>>>
False
