<<<Analysis>>>
In the `test()` method of the `Test` class, the following steps are performed:

1. A database connection is established with the name 'test_database.db'.
2. A new ticket is inserted into the database for the movie 'Avengers: Endgame' at theater 'Cinema 1' in seat 'A1' for the customer 'ddd'.
3. The tickets for the customer 'ddd' are searched and stored in the `tickets` variable.
4. The id of the first ticket in the `tickets` list is stored in the `ticket_id` variable.
5. The ticket with the id stored in `ticket_id` is deleted from the database.
6. The tickets for the customer 'ddd' are searched again and stored in the `tickets` variable.
7. The length of the `tickets` list is returned twice.

The `search_tickets_by_customer()` method returns a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a ticket. The length of this list is the number of tickets for the customer.

In this case, the customer 'ddd' has one ticket before the deletion and no tickets after the deletion. Therefore, the return value of `Test.test()` is `(1, 0)`.

<<<Output>>>
(1, 0)
