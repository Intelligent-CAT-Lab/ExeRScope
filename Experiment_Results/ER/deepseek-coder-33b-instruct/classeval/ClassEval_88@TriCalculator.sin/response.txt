In the `Test.test()` method, an instance of the `TriCalculator` class is created and the `sin` method is invoked with the argument `0`.

The `sin` method calculates the sine of a given angle using the Taylor series approximation. The Taylor series for sine is:

sin(x) = x - x^3/3! + x^5/5! - x^7/7! + ...

In this method, the angle `x` is converted from degrees to radians by multiplying by `pi/180`. The Taylor series is then calculated up to `n` terms, where `n` is a parameter to the `taylor` method.

In the `taylor` method, the variable `a` is initialized to `1`, and `x` is divided by `180` and multiplied by `pi` to convert the angle from degrees to radians. The variable `count` is initialized to `1`.

A for loop iterates from `1` to `n`, and for each iteration, if `count` is odd, `a` is subtracted from the result of `(x ** (2 * k)) / self.factorial(2 * k)`, otherwise, `a` is added to the result. `count` is then incremented by `1`.

After the loop completes, `a` is returned, which is the calculated sine of the angle.

In the `sin` method, the variable `g` is initialized to `0`, `t` is initialized to `x`, and `n` is initialized to `1`.

A while loop continues until the absolute value of `t` is less than `1e-15`. In each iteration, `g` is added to `t`, `n` is incremented by `1`, and `t` is updated to `-t * x * x / (2 * n - 1) / (2 * n - 2)`.

After the loop completes, `g` is returned, which is the calculated sine of the angle.

In the `Test.test()` method, the `sin` method of the `tricalculator` instance is called with the argument `0`, which returns the sine of `0`, which is `0`.
