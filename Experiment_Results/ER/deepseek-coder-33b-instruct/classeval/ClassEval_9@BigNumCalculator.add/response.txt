In the test() method, an instance of BigNumCalculator is created and the add() method is invoked with two large numbers as arguments. The purpose of the add() method is to add two numbers represented as strings.

The add() method first determines the maximum length of the two numbers and pads the shorter number with zeros on the left to make both numbers the same length.

Then, it initializes a variable carry to 0, which will be used to carry over any value that exceeds 10 during the addition process.

A for loop is then used to iterate over each digit of the numbers from right to left. For each digit, it calculates the sum of the corresponding digits in the two numbers and the carry from the previous digit. If the sum is greater than 10, it updates the carry and the digit.

After the loop, if there is still a carry value left, it is added to the result.

Finally, it joins all the digits in the result list into a single string and returns it.

In the test case, '123456789012345678922' and '98765432109876543210' are added together. The result is '222222222122222222222'.

<<<Output>>>
'222222222122222222222'
