<<<Analysis>>>
In the test() method, an instance of the TimeUtils class is created. The get_format_time() method is then called on this instance, passing in the year, month, day, hour, minute, and second as arguments.

The get_format_time() method takes these arguments and uses them to create a datetime object. It then formats this datetime object into a string using the "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S" format.

The arguments passed in are: year=2001, month=7, day=16, hour=1, minute=1, second=1.

The datetime object created is: datetime.datetime(2001, 7, 16, 1, 1, 1)

This datetime object is then formatted into a string using the "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S" format, resulting in the string "2001-07-16 01:01:01".

This string is then returned by the get_format_time() method.

<<<Output>>>
"2001-07-16 01:01:01"
