In the test() method, a new instance of BlackjackGame is created. The player's hand is set to ['2S', '4S', '5S'] and the dealer's hand is set to ['2S', 'JS', 'QS'].

The check_winner() method is then called with the player's hand and dealer's hand as arguments. This method calculates the value of each hand using the calculate_hand_value() method.

The calculate_hand_value() method iterates over each card in the hand. For each card, it extracts the rank and suit. If the rank is a digit, it adds the rank to the value. If the rank is a face card (J, Q, K), it adds 10 to the value. If the rank is an Ace, it adds 11 to the value and increments the num_aces counter.

After all cards have been processed, the method checks if the value is greater than 21 and if there are any aces. If it is, it subtracts 10 from the value and decrements the num_aces counter. This is done until the value is less than or equal to 21 or there are no more aces.

The check_winner() method then compares the values of the player's hand and dealer's hand. If both values are greater than 21, the player with the lower value wins. If only one hand's value is greater than 21, the other hand wins. If neither hand's value is greater than 21, the hand with the lower value wins.

In this case, the player's hand value is 11 (2 + 4 + 5), and the dealer's hand value is 22 (2 + 10 + 10). Since the player's hand value is less than or equal to 21 and the dealer's hand value is greater than 21, the dealer wins.

<<<Output>>>
'Dealer wins'
