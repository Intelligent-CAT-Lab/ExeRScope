<<<Analysis>>>
In the test() method, a StockPortfolioTracker object is created with a cash balance of 10000.0.
The portfolio of the tracker is then set to contain one stock, 'AAPL', with a price of 0.0 and a quantity of 10.
The calculate_portfolio_value() method is then called on the tracker.

The calculate_portfolio_value() method calculates the total value of the portfolio by adding the cash balance to the value of each stock in the portfolio.

The value of each stock is calculated by calling the get_stock_value() method, which multiplies the price of the stock by the quantity.

In this case, the value of the 'AAPL' stock is 0.0 * 10 = 0.0.

So, the total portfolio value is 10000.0 + 0.0 = 10000.0.

<<<Output>>>
10000.0
