In the test() method, an instance of the EncryptionUtils class is created with the key "key". The vigenere_cipher() method is then called on this instance with the input 'abc'.

The vigenere_cipher() method takes a plaintext string and a key as input. It encrypts the plaintext using the Vigenère cipher, which is a method of encrypting alphabetic text. The Vigenère cipher uses a simple form of polyalphabetic substitution.

The method works by iterating over each character in the plaintext. If the character is a letter, it calculates a shift value based on the corresponding character in the key. The shift value is the position of the key character in the alphabet (0-25).

The encrypted character is calculated by shifting the plaintext character by the shift value, wrapping around to the start of the alphabet if necessary. If the plaintext character is uppercase, the encrypted character is also converted to uppercase.

In this case, the key is "key", and the plaintext is 'abc'. The shift values for each character are calculated as follows:

- 'a' is shifted by 10 positions (since 'k' is the 11th letter of the alphabet)
- 'b' is shifted by 4 positions (since 'e' is the 5th letter of the alphabet)
- 'c' is shifted by 11 positions (since 'k' is the 11th letter of the alphabet)

The encrypted characters are 'k', 'f', and 'l', respectively. Therefore, the encrypted text is 'kfl'.

<<<Output>>>
'kfl'
