In the test() method, the BitStatusUtil.remove(6, 2) method is invoked. The purpose of this method is to remove a specific status from a given state. In this case, states = 6 and stat = 2.

The remove() method first checks if the state has the status using the has() method. The has() method checks if the state and status have the same bits set. In this case, (6 & 2) == 2, so the state has the status.

Then, if the state has the status, it removes the status from the state using the bitwise XOR operator (^). The bitwise XOR operator returns 1 if the bits are different and 0 if they are the same. In this case, 6 ^ 2 = 4.

So, the remove() method returns 4.
