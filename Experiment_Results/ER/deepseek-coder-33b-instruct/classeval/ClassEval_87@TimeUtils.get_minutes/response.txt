In the test() method, an instance of the TimeUtils class is created. The get_minutes() method is then called on this instance with two string arguments. The purpose of this method is to calculate the difference in minutes between two times given as strings.

The get_minutes() method first converts the two string arguments to datetime objects using the string_to_datetime() method. It then subtracts the second datetime from the first to get a timedelta object. The difference in seconds is obtained from this timedelta object and divided by 60 to get the difference in minutes. The result is rounded to the nearest whole number.

In this case, the two string arguments are '2001-7-18 1:1:1' and '2001-7-18 5:1:1'. The first datetime object represents 1:01:01 AM on July 18, 2001, and the second datetime object represents 5:01:01 AM on July 18, 2001. The difference in seconds between these two times is 14400 seconds (4 hours), and dividing this by 60 gives 240 minutes.

So, the return value of timeutils.get_minutes('2001-7-18 1:1:1', '2001-7-18 5:1:1') is 240.
