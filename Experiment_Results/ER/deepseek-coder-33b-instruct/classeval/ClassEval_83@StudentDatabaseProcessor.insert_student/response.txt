<<<Analysis>>>
In the `test()` method, the following steps are performed:
1. An instance of `StudentDatabaseProcessor` is created with the database name "test_database.db".
2. The `create_student_table()` method is called to create a table named "students" in the database if it doesn't already exist.
3. A dictionary `student_data` is created with the details of a student.
4. The `insert_student()` method is called to insert the student data into the "students" table.
5. The `search_student_by_name()` method is called to search for the student with the name "Bob" in the "students" table.
6. The `len()` function is used to count the number of rows returned by the search query.
7. The `result[0][1]` is used to get the name of the first student in the result.

<<<Output>>>
(1, 'Bob')
