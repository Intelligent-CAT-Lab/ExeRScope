The `Test.test()` method is calling the `merge_pdfs()` method of the `PDFHandler` class. This method is merging the PDFs specified in the `filepaths` list and saving the merged PDF as "merged.pdf".

The `merge_pdfs()` method first creates a `PdfWriter` object. Then, for each PDF reader in the `readers` list, it iterates over each page in the PDF and adds it to the `PdfWriter` object. Finally, it writes the merged PDF to the file "merged.pdf".

The `test()` method then checks if the "merged.pdf" file exists in the current directory. If it does, it returns a message indicating that the merged PDFs were saved at "merged.pdf". If it doesn't, it returns a message indicating that the file was not found.

The `Test.test()` method is calling the `merge_pdfs()` method twice. This is likely a mistake and should be corrected to call the method only once.

The `Test.test()` method is likely returning a message indicating that the merged PDFs were saved at "merged.pdf". However, the `merge_pdfs()` method is being called twice, which is likely a mistake.
