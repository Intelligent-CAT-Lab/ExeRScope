In the `test()` method, an instance of the `BookManagement` class is created and assigned to `self.bookManagement`.

The `add_book()` method is called three times:
1. `self.bookManagement.add_book("book1", 2)`: This adds a book titled "book1" to the inventory with a quantity of 2.
2. `self.bookManagement.add_book("book2")`: This adds a book titled "book2" to the inventory with a default quantity of 1.
3. `self.bookManagement.remove_book("book1", 2)`: This removes 2 books titled "book1" from the inventory.

The `remove_book()` method checks if the book is in the inventory and if the quantity to be removed is less than or equal to the current quantity. If the book is not in the inventory or the quantity to be removed is more than the current quantity, it raises a `False` exception. Otherwise, it reduces the quantity of the book in the inventory by the specified amount. If the quantity of the book becomes 0 after the removal, it removes the book from the inventory.

The `view_inventory()` method returns the current inventory.

The `view_book_quantity()` method returns the quantity of a specific book in the inventory. If the book is not in the inventory, it returns 0.

After these operations, the inventory should be `{'book2': 1}`.

<<<Output>>>
{'book2': 1}
