<<<Analysis>>>
In the test() method, a ComplexCalculator object is created and the multiply() method is invoked with two complex numbers as arguments. The purpose of this method is to multiply two complex numbers.

The multiply() method takes two complex numbers c1 and c2 as input. It calculates the real part of the result by multiplying the real parts of c1 and c2 and subtracting the product of the imaginary parts of c1 and c2. It calculates the imaginary part of the result by adding the product of the real part of c1 and the imaginary part of c2 to the product of the imaginary part of c1 and the real part of c2.

In this case, c1 = (1 + 2j) and c2 = (3 + 4j).

The real part of the result is calculated as (1 * 3 - 2 * 4) = -5.
The imaginary part of the result is calculated as (1 * 4 + 2 * 3) = 10.

So, the result of the multiplication is (-5 + 10j).

<<<Output>>>
(-5+10j)
