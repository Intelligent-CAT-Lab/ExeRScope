In the `test()` method, an instance of `NumericEntityUnescaper` is created and the `is_hex_char()` method is invoked with the argument 'F'. The purpose of this method is to check if a given character is a hexadecimal digit.

The `is_hex_char()` method checks if the character is a digit or a letter between 'a' and 'f' (inclusive). In this case, the character 'F' is a hexadecimal digit, so the method returns True.

<<<Output>>>
True
