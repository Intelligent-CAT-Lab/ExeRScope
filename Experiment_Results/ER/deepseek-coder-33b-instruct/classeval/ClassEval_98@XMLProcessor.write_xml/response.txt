In the `test()` method of the `Test` class, the following steps are performed:

1. A new XML file named 'test.xml' is created and written with the content '<root>\n    <item>apple</item>\n    <item>orange</item>\n</root>'.
2. An instance of `XMLProcessor` is created with the file name 'test.xml'.
3. The XML file is parsed and the root element is set as the root of the XMLProcessor instance.
4. The `write_xml()` method of the XMLProcessor instance is called with the file name 'output.xml'. This method writes the XML content to the 'output.xml' file.
5. Another instance of `XMLProcessor` is created with the file name 'output.xml'.
6. The XML file is parsed and the root element is set as the root of the second XMLProcessor instance.
7. The `findall()` method of the second XMLProcessor instance is called with the element name 'item'. This method finds all elements with the name 'item' in the XML.
8. The text of the first and second 'item' elements is retrieved and stored in the variables `lst[0].text` and `lst[1].text`.
9. The 'output.xml' and 'test.xml' files are removed.

The return value of the `test()` method is a tuple containing the result of the `write_xml()` method, the root of the second XMLProcessor instance, and the text of the first and second 'item' elements.

<<<Output>>>
(True, <Element 'root' at 0x7f8b8c077740>, 'APPLE', 'ORANGE')
