In the test() method, an IPAddress object is created with an invalid IP address ".10.10.10".
The is_valid() method is called on this object. This method splits the IP address into octets and checks if the number of octets is 4. If not, it returns False.
The IP address ".10.10.10" is split into ['.10', '10', '10'] and the length of this list is 3, not 4, so is_valid() returns False.
The get_binary() method is then called on this object. This method checks if the IP address is valid. Since the IP address is not valid (is_valid() returns False), get_binary() returns an empty string.
