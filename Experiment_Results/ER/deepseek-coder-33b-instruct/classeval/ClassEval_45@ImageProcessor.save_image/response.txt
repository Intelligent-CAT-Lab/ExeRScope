<<<Analysis>>>
In the `test()` method of the `Test` class, an instance of `ImageProcessor` is created and assigned to `self.processor`. The `image_path` is set to the path of a test image "test.png" in the same directory as the script. A new white image of size 100x100 is created and saved as "test.png". The `load_image()` method of `self.processor` is then called with `self.image_path` as the argument, which loads the image from the file.

The `save_path` is set to the path of a new image "test_save.png" in the same directory as the script. The `save_image()` method of `self.processor` is then called with `save_path` as the argument, which saves the image to the file.

Finally, the saved image is opened and returned. The `Image.open()` function opens the image file and returns an `Image` object. The `Image` object represents the image in memory and can be manipulated further.

<<<Output>>>
An `Image` object representing the saved image.
