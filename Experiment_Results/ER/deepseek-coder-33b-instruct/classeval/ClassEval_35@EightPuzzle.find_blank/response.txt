<<<Analysis>>>
In the `test()` method, an instance of the `EightPuzzle` class is created with an initial state. The `find_blank()` method is then called on this instance with the initial state as the argument.

The `find_blank()` method iterates over the rows and columns of the state. It checks each element of the state. If the element is 0, it means it's the blank space in the puzzle. The method returns the row and column indices of the blank space.

In the given initial state, the blank space is at the 1st row and 3rd column. So, the `find_blank()` method returns (0, 2).

<<<Output>>>
(0, 2)
