<<<Analysis>>>
In the test() method, an instance of the BookManagement class is created.
The add_book() method is then called with the arguments "book1" and 2. This method adds a book to the inventory dictionary with the title "book1" and the quantity 2.
After adding the book, the view_book_quantity() method is called with the argument "book1". This method returns the quantity of the book with the title "book1" in the inventory.
Since we have added a book with the title "book1" and the quantity 2, the view_book_quantity() method should return 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
