In the test() method, the DataStatistics4.pdf() method is invoked with the parameters [1, 2, 3], 1, 1. The purpose of this method is to calculate the probability density function (PDF) of a given data set.

The PDF is calculated as follows:

1. For each element in the data set, the formula 1 / (sigma * sqrt(2 * pi)) * e^(-0.5 * ((x - mu) / sigma)^2) is applied, where x is the element, mu is the mean of the data set, and sigma is the standard deviation of the data set.

2. The result of each calculation is stored in a list, which is then returned as the output.

In this case, the data set is [1, 2, 3], mu is 1, and sigma is 1.

The calculations are as follows:

1. For x = 1, the formula becomes 1 / (1 * sqrt(2 * pi)) * e^(-0.5 * ((1 - 1) / 1)^2) = 1 / (1 * 1.4142) * e^(-0.5 * 0) = 0.4432

2. For x = 2, the formula becomes 1 / (1 * sqrt(2 * pi)) * e^(-0.5 * ((2 - 1) / 1)^2) = 0.4432

3. For x = 3, the formula becomes 1 / (1 * sqrt(2 * pi)) * e^(-0.5 * ((3 - 1) / 1)^2) = 0.4432

So, the output of the pdf() method is [0.4432, 0.4432, 0.4432].
