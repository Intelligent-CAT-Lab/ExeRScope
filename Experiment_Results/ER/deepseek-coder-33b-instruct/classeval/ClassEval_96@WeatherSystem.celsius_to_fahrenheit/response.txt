In the test() method, a WeatherSystem object is created with the city 'New York'. The temperature of the city is set to 23 degrees Celsius. Then, the celsius_to_fahrenheit() method is called on the weatherSystem object.

The celsius_to_fahrenheit() method converts the temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit. The formula for this conversion is (Celsius * 9/5) + 32.

So, the temperature in Celsius is 23. The method will return (23 * 9/5) + 32 = 73.4 degrees Fahrenheit.
