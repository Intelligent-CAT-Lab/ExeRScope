<<<Analysis>>>
In the `test()` method of the `Test` class, the `process_data()` method of the `NLPDataProcessor2` class is invoked with an empty list as an argument. The purpose of this method is to process a list of strings, removing non-English letters, converting to lowercase, and splitting each string into words.

The `process_data()` method initializes an empty list `words_list`. It then iterates over each string in the input list. For each string, it removes non-English letters and converts to lowercase using the `re.sub()` function. It then splits the string into words using the `split()` method and appends the list of words to `words_list`.

In this case, the input list is empty, so `words_list` remains empty. The method then returns `words_list`, which is an empty list.

The `expected_output` is also an empty list.
