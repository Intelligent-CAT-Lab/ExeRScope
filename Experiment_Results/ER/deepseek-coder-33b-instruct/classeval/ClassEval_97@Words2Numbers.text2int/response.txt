<<<Analysis>>>
In the `test()` method, an instance of the `Words2Numbers` class is created and assigned to the variable `w2n`. Then, the `text2int` method of the `w2n` object is called with the string 'one million and eleven' as an argument.

The `text2int` method is defined to convert a string of words into a numerical representation. It first replaces any hyphens in the input string with spaces.

The method then splits the string into individual words and iterates over each word. For each word, it checks if the word is in the `ordinal_words` dictionary. If it is, it multiplies the current number by the scale (which is always 1 in this case) and adds the increment (which is the value of the word in the `ordinal_words` dictionary).

If the word is not in the `ordinal_words` dictionary, it checks if the word ends with any of the endings in the `ordinal_endings` list. If it does, it removes the ending and adds the replacement.

If the word is still not in the `numwords` dictionary, it adds the word to the `curstring` variable and resets the `current` and `result` variables. If the word is in the `numwords` dictionary, it multiplies the current number by the scale and adds the increment. If the scale is greater than 100, it adds the current number to the result and resets the current number.

Finally, if the current number is not zero, it adds the current number to the `curstring` variable.

In the case of 'one million and eleven', the method will return '10000011'.
