<<<Analysis>>>
In the `test()` method, an instance of the `MetricsCalculator` class is created and assigned to the variable `mc`.
Then, the `update()` method of the `mc` object is called with two lists as arguments. The first list contains the predicted labels and the second list contains the true labels.
The `update()` method iterates over the two lists in parallel using the `zip()` function. For each pair of predicted and true labels, it increments the appropriate counter variable in the `mc` object.
In this case, the predicted labels are [1, 1, 0, 0] and the true labels are [1, 1, 0, 1].
The `update()` method will increment `true_positives` twice (for the first and second elements), `false_positives` once (for the third element), and `false_negatives` once (for the fourth element).
After the `update()` method is called, the `test()` method returns `None` because there is no explicit return statement.

<<<Output>>>
None
