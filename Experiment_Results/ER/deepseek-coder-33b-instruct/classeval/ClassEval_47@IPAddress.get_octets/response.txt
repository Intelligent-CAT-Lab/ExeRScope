<<<Analysis>>>
In the test() method, an IPAddress object is created with the IP address "10.10.10.10".
The get_octets() method is then called on this object.
The get_octets() method checks if the IP address is valid. If it is, it splits the IP address into its four octets and returns them as a list.
The IP address "10.10.10.10" is valid, so the get_octets() method splits the IP address into its four octets and returns them as a list.
<<<Output>>>
['10', '10', '10', '10']
