In the test() method, a new instance of the CalendarUtil class is created and assigned to the variable calendar.
An event is added to the calendar's events list. The event is a dictionary with keys 'date', 'start_time', 'end_time', and 'description'.
The is_available() method of the calendar object is then called with two datetime objects as arguments. The method checks if the given time slot is available for scheduling an event.
The is_available() method iterates over all events in the calendar. For each event, it checks if the given time slot overlaps with the event's time slot. If it does, the method returns False, indicating that the time slot is not available.
In this case, the time slot given is the same as the time slot of the event already in the calendar. Therefore, the method will return False, indicating that the time slot is not available.
<<<Output>>>
False
