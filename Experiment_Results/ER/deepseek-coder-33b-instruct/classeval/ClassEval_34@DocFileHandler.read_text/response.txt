<<<Analysis>>>
In the `test()` method of the `Test` class, the following steps are performed:

1. The file path is set to "test_example.docx".
2. An instance of the `DocFileHandler` class is created with the file path as an argument.
3. A new Word document is created and two paragraphs are added to it. The first paragraph contains "aaa" and the second "bbb". The document is saved with the file path.
4. The `read_text()` method of the `DocFileHandler` instance is called to read the text from the document.
5. The expected content is set to "aaa\nbbb".
6. The file is checked if it exists and if it does, it is removed.
7. The method returns a tuple containing the text content read from the document and the expected content.

<<<Output>>>
("aaa\nbbb", "aaa\nbbb")
