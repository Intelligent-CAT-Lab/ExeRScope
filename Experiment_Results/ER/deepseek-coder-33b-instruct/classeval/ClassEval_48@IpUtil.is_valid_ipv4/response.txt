In the test() method, the IpUtil.is_valid_ipv4('10.10.10.10') method is invoked. The purpose of this method is to check if a given string is a valid IPv4 address. In this case, the input is '10.10.10.10'.
The method uses the socket.inet_pton() function to convert the IP address string to a packed 32-bit binary format. If the conversion is successful, it means the IP address is valid. If an error occurs during the conversion, it means the IP address is not valid.
In this case, '10.10.10.10' is a valid IPv4 address, so the method will return True.
<<<Output>>>
True
