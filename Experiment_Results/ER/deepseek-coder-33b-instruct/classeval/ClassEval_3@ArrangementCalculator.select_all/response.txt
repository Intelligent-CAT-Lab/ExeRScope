<<<Analysis>>>
In the test() method, an instance of ArrangementCalculator is created with the input [1].
The select_all() method is then called on this instance.
The select_all() method generates all possible permutations of the input list [1].
In this case, there is only one element in the list, so the only permutation is the list itself.
So, the output of select_all() is [[1]].
The expected output is also [[1]], which is the expected output.
So, the return value of Test.test() is ([[1]], [[1]])

<<<Output>>>
([[1]], [[1]])
