<<<Analysis>>>
In the test() method, an instance of the Lemmatization class is created and stored in the variable lemmatization.
The method lemmatization.get_pos_tag() is then called with the string "The dog's barked at the mailman." as an argument.
The get_pos_tag() method tokenizes the input sentence into words using the word_tokenize() function from the nltk library.
The pos_tag() function from the nltk library is then used to tag each word with its part of speech.
The method then iterates over the tagged words, appending the part of speech tag to the list pos_tags.
Finally, the method returns the list pos_tags.

The expected output is a list of part of speech tags corresponding to the words in the input sentence.

The pos_tags list will be ['DT', 'NNS', 'VBD', 'IN', 'DT', 'NN'], where:
- 'DT' stands for determiner
- 'NNS' stands for noun, plural
- 'VBD' stands for verb, past tense
- 'IN' stands for preposition
- 'NN' stands for noun, singular

<<<Output>>>
(['DT', 'NNS', 'VBD', 'IN', 'DT', 'NN'], ['DT', 'NNS', 'VBD', 'IN', 'DT', 'NN'])
