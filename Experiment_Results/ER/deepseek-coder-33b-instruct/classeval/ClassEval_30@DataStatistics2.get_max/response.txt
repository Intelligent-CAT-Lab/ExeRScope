<<<Analysis>>>
In the test() method, a DataStatistics2 object is created with the data [-1, 4, 3, 2].
The get_max() method is then called on this object.
The get_max() method is a part of the DataStatistics2 class and it uses the numpy max() function to find the maximum value in the data array.
In this case, the data array is [-1, 4, 3, 2]. The max() function returns the maximum value in the array, which is 4.
<<<Output>>>
4
