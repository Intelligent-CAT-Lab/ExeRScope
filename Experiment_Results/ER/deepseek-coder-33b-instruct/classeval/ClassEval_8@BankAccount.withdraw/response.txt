<<<Analysis>>>
In the test() method, a new BankAccount object is created with a balance of 1000.
The withdraw() method is then called on this object with an amount of 500.
The withdraw() method first checks if the amount is less than 0, and if so, raises a ValueError.
Next, it checks if the amount is greater than the current balance, and if so, raises a ValueError.
If neither of these conditions are met, it subtracts the amount from the balance and returns the new balance.
In this case, the balance is 1000 and the amount to withdraw is 500, so the new balance is 500.
<<<Output>>>
500
