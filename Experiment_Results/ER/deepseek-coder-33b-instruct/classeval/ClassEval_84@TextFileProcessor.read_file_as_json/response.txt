<<<Analysis>>>
In the `test()` method of the `Test` class, a list of file names is created and a list of contents is created. Then, for each file in the list, a file is created with the corresponding content.

A `TextFileProcessor` object is created with the first file in the list. The `read_file_as_json()` method of the `TextFileProcessor` object is then called. This method opens the file, reads the content, and loads the content as a JSON object.

The expected output is a dictionary with the keys "name" and "age" and the values "test" and 12.

The output of the `read_file_as_json()` method is then compared to the expected output. If they match, the test passes.

<<<Output>>>
(dict, {'name': 'test', 'age': 12}, {'name': 'test', 'age': 12})
