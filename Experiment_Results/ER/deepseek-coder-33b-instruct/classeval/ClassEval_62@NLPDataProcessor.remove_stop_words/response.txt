<<<Analysis>>>
In the test() method, an instance of NLPDataProcessor is created and assigned to self.processor.
A list of strings is created and assigned to string_list.
An empty list is created and assigned to stop_word_list.
The remove_stop_words() method is called with string_list and stop_word_list as arguments.
The remove_stop_words() method iterates over each string in string_list. For each string, it splits the string into a list of words. Then it iterates over each word in the list of words. If the word is in the stop_word_list, it removes the word from the list of words.
In this case, since the stop_word_list is empty, no words are removed from the list of words.
The method returns the list of lists of words.
The expected_words_list is a list of lists of words where each list of words is the original string split into words.
The return value of the test() method is a tuple containing the words_list and expected_words_list.
