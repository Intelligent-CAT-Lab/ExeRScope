In the `test()` method, an instance of the `TriCalculator` class is created and the `tan()` method is invoked with the argument 60.

The `tan()` method calculates the tangent of an angle. It does this by dividing the sine of the angle by the cosine of the angle.

The `sin()` method calculates the sine of an angle using the Taylor series approximation. The Taylor series is an infinite series of mathematical terms that, when added together, approximate the value of a function.

The `cos()` method calculates the cosine of an angle using the Taylor series approximation.

The `taylor()` method is a helper method that calculates the Taylor series approximation of a function.

The `factorial()` method calculates the factorial of a number.

The angle 60 is converted to radians by multiplying it by pi/180.

The `tan()` method returns the tangent of the angle, rounded to 10 decimal places.

The `test()` method returns the result of the `tan()` method.
