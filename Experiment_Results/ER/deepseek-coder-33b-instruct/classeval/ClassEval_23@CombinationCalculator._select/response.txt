The `test()` method in the `Test` class is invoked. Inside this method, an instance of `CombinationCalculator` is created with a list of strings as input. The `_select()` method of this instance is then called with 0, an empty list, 0, and an empty list as arguments.

The `_select()` method is a recursive method that generates all possible combinations of the input list. It takes four arguments: `dataIndex`, `resultList`, `resultIndex`, and `result`. `dataIndex` is the current index in the input list, `resultList` is the current combination, `resultIndex` is the current index in the combination, and `result` is the list of all combinations.

The method starts by checking if `resultCount` (which is `resultIndex` + 1) is greater than `resultLen` (which is the length of `resultList`). If it is, it appends a copy of `resultList` to `result` and returns.

Then, for each index `i` in the range from `dataIndex` to `len(self.datas) + resultCount - resultLen`, it sets `resultList[resultIndex]` to `self.datas[i]`, and calls `_select()` with `i + 1`, `resultList`, `resultIndex + 1`, and `result`.

The base case of the recursion is when `resultCount` is greater than `resultLen`, at which point the current combination is appended to `result`.

Since the input list is empty and `resultCount` is 0, the base case is immediately met, and `result` is returned as an empty list.
