<<<Analysis>>>
In the `test()` method of the `Test` class, an instance of `NLPDataProcessor` is created and assigned to `self.processor`.
Then, the `construct_stop_word_list()` method of `self.processor` is called, which returns a list of stop words.
The expected stop words are defined as ['a', 'an', 'the'].
Finally, the method returns a tuple containing the actual stop words and the expected stop words.

<<<Output>>>
(['a', 'an', 'the'], ['a', 'an', 'the'])
