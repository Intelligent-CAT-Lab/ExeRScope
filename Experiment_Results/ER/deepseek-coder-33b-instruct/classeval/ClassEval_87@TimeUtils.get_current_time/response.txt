<<<Analysis>>>
In the `test()` method of the `Test` class, an instance of `TimeUtils` is created. This instance is stored in the variable `timeutils`.

The `get_current_time()` method of `timeutils` is then called. This method formats the current time as a string in the format "%H:%M:%S". The current time is obtained from the `datetime` attribute of `timeutils`.

The `strftime('%H:%M:%S')` method is then called on the `datetime` attribute of `timeutils`. This method also formats the current time as a string in the same format.

The return value of the `test()` method is a tuple containing the two formatted time strings.

<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will be a tuple containing two strings. The first string is the current time formatted as "%H:%M:%S", and the second string is also the current time, but formatted in the same way.
