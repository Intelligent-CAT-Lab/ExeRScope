<<<Analysis>>>
In the test() method, a new instance of the ShoppingCart class is created and assigned to the variable shoppingcart.
The add_item() method is then called on shoppingcart, adding an item "apple" with a price of 1 and a quantity of 2.
The view_items() method is then called on shoppingcart, which returns a dictionary of all items in the shopping cart.
In the add_item() method, if the item is already in the items dictionary, the price and quantity of the item are updated. If the item is not in the items dictionary, a new entry is created with the item as the key and a dictionary containing the price and quantity as the value.
In this case, since "apple" is not in the items dictionary, a new entry is created with "apple" as the key and a dictionary containing the price and quantity as the value.
<<<Output>>>
{'apple': {'price': 1, 'quantity': 2}}
