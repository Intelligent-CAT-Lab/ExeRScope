In the `test()` method of the `Test` class, several operations are performed on a Word document.

1. The `DocFileHandler` class is initialized with a file path "test_example.docx".
2. A new document is created and a paragraph with the text "Initial content" is added. The document is saved.
3. The `read_text()` method of the `DocFileHandler` class is called to read the content of the document. The content is returned as a string.
4. The expected content is set to "Initial content".
5. The `write_text()` method of the `DocFileHandler` class is called to write the text "New content 1" to the document.
6. The `read_text()` method is called again to read the updated content of the document.
7. The `add_heading()` method of the `DocFileHandler` class is called to add a heading "Test Heading 1" to the document.
8. The document is opened again and the headings are extracted.
9. A table with two rows and two columns is added to the document. The first row contains the headers "Name" and "Age".
10. The document is opened again and the table is extracted.
11. If the file exists, it is deleted.

The return value of the `test()` method is a tuple containing the following values:
- The initial content of the document.
- The expected content of the document.
- The updated content of the document.
- The new content that was written to the document.
- The heading that was added to the document.
- The headings that were extracted from the document.
- The number of rows in the table.
- The number of columns in the table.

<<<Output>>>
('Initial content', 'Initial content', 'New content 1', 'New content 1', 'Test Heading 1', ['Test Heading 1'], 2, 2)
