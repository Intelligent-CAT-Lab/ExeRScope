In the `Test.test()` method, an instance of the `JSONProcessor` class is created and assigned to the `self.processor` attribute. A dictionary `self.test_data` is created with three key-value pairs. A file path `self.file_path` is set to "test.json".

Then, a file named "test_only_read.json" is created with the content `{"key1": "value1"}`. The file permissions are set to read-only using `os.chmod()`.

Finally, the `write_json()` method of the `JSONProcessor` instance is called with `self.test_data` and `self.file_path_only_read` as arguments. This method attempts to write the `self.test_data` to the file at `self.file_path_only_read`.

However, since the file is read-only, an exception is raised and the `write_json()` method returns -1.

<<<Analysis>>>
The `write_json()` method attempts to write the `data` to the file at `file_path`. If the file does not exist, it is created. If the file exists and is read-only, an exception is raised and the method returns -1.

<<<Output>>>
-1
