<<<Analysis>>>
In the `test()` method, a new instance of `CamelCaseMap` is created and assigned to the variable `camelize_map`.

The `__setitem__` method is then called on `camelize_map` with the key 'first_name' and the value 'John'. This method calls `_convert_key` on the key, which in this case converts the key to camel case ('firstName'). The key-value pair is then added to the `_data` dictionary of `camelize_map`.

Next, the `__setitem__` method is called again on `camelize_map` with the key 'first_Name' and the value 'newname'. This time, the key is not converted to camel case because it is already in camel case. The key-value pair is then added to the `_data` dictionary of `camelize_map`.

Finally, the `__getitem__` method is called on `camelize_map` with the key 'first_name'. This method calls `_convert_key` on the key, which in this case converts the key to camel case ('firstName'). The method then retrieves the value associated with the key 'firstName' from the `_data` dictionary of `camelize_map` and returns it.

The `_to_camel_case` method splits the key into parts based on the underscore character, and then joins the parts together with the first part in lowercase and the rest in title case.

<<<Output>>>
'newname'
