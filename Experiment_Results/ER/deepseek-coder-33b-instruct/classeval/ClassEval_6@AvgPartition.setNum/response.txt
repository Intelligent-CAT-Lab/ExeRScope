In the `test()` method, an instance of the `AvgPartition` class is created with a list of integers and a limit. The `setNum()` method is then called on this instance.

The `setNum()` method calculates the size of each partition by dividing the length of the list by the limit. The remainder is calculated by finding the modulus of the length of the list and the limit.

In this case, the length of the list is 5 and the limit is 2. So, the size of each partition is 5 // 2 = 2, and the remainder is 5 % 2 = 1.

The `setNum()` method returns a tuple containing the size and the remainder.

So, the output of `Test.test()` would be (2, 1).

<<<Output>>>
