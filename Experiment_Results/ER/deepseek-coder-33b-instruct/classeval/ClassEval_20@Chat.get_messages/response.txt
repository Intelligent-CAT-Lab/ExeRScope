<<<Analysis>>>
In the test() method, a new Chat object is created and assigned to the variable chat.
Then, a timestamp is generated using the datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S") method and assigned to the variable timestamp.
The users dictionary of the chat object is then updated with a message from 'John' to 'Mary'.
Finally, the get_messages() method is called on the chat object with the argument 'John'. This method returns the list of messages for the user 'John'.
In this case, the output will be a list with one message from 'John' to 'Mary'.

<<<Output>>>
[{'sender': 'John', 'receiver': 'Mary', 'message': 'Hello', 'timestamp': '2022-01-01 00:00:00'}]
