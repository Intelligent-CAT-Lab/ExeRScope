In the `test()` method, an instance of the `Manacher` class is created with the input string 'ababax'. The `palindromic_string()` method is then called on this instance.

The `palindromic_string()` method works by first initializing `max_length` to 0, `new_input_string` to an empty string, and `output_string` to an empty string.

Then, it iterates over each character in the input string, adding a '|' between each character to create `new_input_string`.

For each character in `new_input_string`, it calculates the length of the palindromic substring centered at that character using the `palindromic_length()` method. If this length is greater than `max_length`, it updates `max_length` and `start`.

Finally, it iterates over the substring of `new_input_string` starting at `start - max_length` and ending at `start + max_length + 1`, adding each character (except '|') to `output_string`.

The `palindromic_length()` method works by recursively calling itself, incrementing `diff` each time, until it reaches a character that is not the same as the center character or it reaches the start or end of the string. It returns the number of characters it has checked, which is the length of the palindromic substring centered at the center character.
