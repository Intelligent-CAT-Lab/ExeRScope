The `test()` method in the `Test` class creates an instance of `CamelCaseMap` and assigns a value to the key 'first_name'. The key is converted to camel case format using the `_convert_key()` method. The `_convert_key()` method checks if the key is a string and if so, it converts it to camel case using the `_to_camel_case()` method. The `_to_camel_case()` method splits the key by underscore and then joins the parts with the first part in lower case and the rest in title case.

After the assignment, the key 'firstName' is deleted from the `CamelCaseMap` instance using the `__delitem__()` method.

The `test()` method does not return any value, so it returns `None`.
