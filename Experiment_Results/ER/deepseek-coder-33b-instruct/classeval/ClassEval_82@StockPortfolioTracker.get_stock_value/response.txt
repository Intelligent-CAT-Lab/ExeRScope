In the test() method, a StockPortfolioTracker object is created with an initial cash balance of 10000.0.
Then, the get_stock_value() method is called on this object with a stock dictionary as input. The stock dictionary contains the name, price, and quantity of the stock.
In the get_stock_value() method, the value of the stock is calculated by multiplying the price and quantity of the stock.
In this case, the stock price is 0.0 and the quantity is 10. So, the value of the stock is 0.0 * 10 = 0.0.
<<<Output>>>
0.0
