In the `test()` method, an instance of `ExcelProcessor` is created and the `write_excel()` method is called with `new_data` and `save_file_name` as arguments.

The `write_excel()` method tries to write the data to an Excel file. If the file name is empty, it will raise an exception and return 0. If the file name is not empty, it will create a new workbook, write the data to it, save the workbook, and close it. If all these operations are successful, it will return 1.

In the `test()` method, `save_file_name` is an empty string. Therefore, the `write_excel()` method will raise an exception and return 0.
