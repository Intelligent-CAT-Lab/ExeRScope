In the test() method, an instance of the JSONProcessor class is created and assigned to the variable self.processor.
A dictionary self.test_data is created with three key-value pairs.
The file path "test.json" is assigned to the variable self.file_path.
A file is created with the name "test.json" and the content "Invalid JSON" is written to it.
The read_json() method of the JSONProcessor class is called with the file path as an argument. This method checks if the file exists. If it does not exist, it returns 0. If it does exist, it tries to read the JSON data from the file.
In this case, the file "test.json" contains invalid JSON data, so the json.load() method raises an exception. This exception is caught and the method returns -1.
<<<Output>>>
-1
