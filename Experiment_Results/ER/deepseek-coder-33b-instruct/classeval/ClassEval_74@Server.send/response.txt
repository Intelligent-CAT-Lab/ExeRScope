<<<Analysis>>>
In the test() method, a Server object is created. Then, the send() method is called with a dictionary as an argument. The dictionary contains a key "content" with a value "abc".

The send() method checks if the info argument is a dictionary and if it contains the keys "addr" and "content". Since the info dictionary does not contain the "addr" key, the method returns "info structure is not correct".

<<<Output>>>
'info structure is not correct'
