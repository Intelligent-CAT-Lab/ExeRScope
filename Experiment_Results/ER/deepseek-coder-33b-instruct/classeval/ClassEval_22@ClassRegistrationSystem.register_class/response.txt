In the `test()` method, an instance of `ClassRegistrationSystem` is created and stored in `self.registration_system`. Then, the `register_class()` method is called with `student_name='John'` and `class_name='CS101'`.

The `register_class()` method checks if `student_name` is already a key in `self.students_registration_classes`. If it is, it appends `class_name` to the list of classes associated with that student. If it's not, it creates a new key-value pair in `self.students_registration_classes` with `student_name` as the key and a list containing `class_name` as the value.

In this case, `student_name='John'` is not a key in `self.students_registration_classes`, so a new key-value pair is created. The method then returns the list of classes associated with 'John', which is `['CS101']`.
