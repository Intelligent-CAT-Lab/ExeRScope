<<<Analysis>>>
In the `test()` method of the `Test` class, an instance of `ExpressionCalculator` is created and stored in `self.expression_calculator`. Then, the `is_operator()` method of `self.expression_calculator` is called with the argument `'-'`.

The `is_operator()` method checks if a given character is an operator. In this case, it is checking if `'-'` is an operator.

The `is_operator()` method uses the `in` keyword to check if the given character is in the set of operators. The set of operators is `{'+', '-', '*', '/', '(', ')', '%'}`.

Since `'-'` is in the set of operators, the `is_operator()` method returns `True`.

<<<Output>>>
True
