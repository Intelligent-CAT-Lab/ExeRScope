<<<Analysis>>>
In the test() method, an instance of the SQLGenerator class is created with the table name 'table1'.
The delete() method is then called on this instance, with the condition "field1 = value1 AND field2 = value2 AND field3 = value3 AND field4 = value4".
The delete() method takes a condition as an argument and returns a SQL DELETE statement. The condition is used to specify which records to delete.
In this case, the condition is "field1 = value1 AND field2 = value2 AND field3 = value3 AND field4 = value4".
The returned SQL statement would be:
"DELETE FROM table1 WHERE field1 = value1 AND field2 = value2 AND field3 = value3 AND field4 = value4;"
<<<Output>>>
"DELETE FROM table1 WHERE field1 = value1 AND field2 = value2 AND field3 = value3 AND field4 = value4;"
