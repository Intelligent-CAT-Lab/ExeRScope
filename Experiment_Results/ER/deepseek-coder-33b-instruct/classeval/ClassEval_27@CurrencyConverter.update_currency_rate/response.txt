In the test() method, a CurrencyConverter object is created and assigned to the variable cc.
Then, the update_currency_rate() method is called on cc, updating the rate of 'CNY' to 3.0.
Finally, the method returns the updated rate of 'CNY' from the rates dictionary of the cc object.

The CurrencyConverter class has a dictionary rates that stores the conversion rates of different currencies. The rates are initially set to some values.
The update_currency_rate() method updates the rate of a given currency. In this case, it updates the rate of 'CNY' to 3.0.
So, the return value of the test() method will be the updated rate of 'CNY', which is 3.0.

<<<Output>>>
3.0
