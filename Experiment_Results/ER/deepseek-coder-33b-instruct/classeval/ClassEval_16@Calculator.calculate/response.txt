In the `Test.test()` method, an instance of the `Calculator` class is created and the `calculate()` method is invoked with the argument '1+2*3'.

The `calculate()` method processes the input string character by character. It maintains two stacks: `operand_stack` and `operator_stack`.

For each character in the input string:
- If the character is a digit or a decimal point, it is added to a buffer `num_buffer`.
- If the character is an operator, it checks the precedence of the operator with the top operator in the `operator_stack`. If the top operator has higher or equal precedence, it applies the operator to the top two operands in the `operand_stack` and pushes the result back to the `operand_stack`.
- If the character is an opening parenthesis, it pushes it to the `operator_stack`.
- If the character is a closing parenthesis, it pops operators from the `operator_stack` and applies them to the top two operands in the `operand_stack` until it encounters an opening parenthesis.

After processing all characters in the input string, it applies remaining operators to the remaining operands in the `operand_stack`.

Finally, it returns the result, which is the only element in the `operand_stack`.

In this case, the input string '1+2*3' is processed as follows:
- '1' is added to `operand_stack`.
- '+' is added to `operator_stack`.
- '2' is added to `operand_stack`.
- '*' is added to `operator_stack`.
- '3' is added to `operand_stack`.
- After processing all characters, it applies '*' to '2' and '3' in the `operand_stack`, and pushes '6' back to the `operand_stack`.
- Then it applies '+' to '1' and '6' in the `operand_stack`, and pushes '7' back to the `operand_stack`.

So, the return value of `calculator.calculate('1+2*3')` is '7'.
