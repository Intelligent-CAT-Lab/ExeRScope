<<<Analysis>>>
In the test() method, a Thermostat object t is created with initial current temperature 25, target temperature 25, and mode 'cool'.
Then, the target temperature is set to 10 using the set_target_temperature() method.
Finally, the get_target_temperature() method is called to retrieve the current target temperature.

The get_target_temperature() method simply returns the value of the target_temperature attribute of the Thermostat object.

In this case, the target temperature was initially set to 25, but it was then changed to 10. Therefore, the get_target_temperature() method will return 10.

<<<Output>>>
10
