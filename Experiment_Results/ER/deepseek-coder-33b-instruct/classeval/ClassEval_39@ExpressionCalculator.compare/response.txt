<<<Analysis>>>
In the `test()` method of the `Test` class, an instance of `ExpressionCalculator` is created and the `compare()` method of this instance is called with the arguments "*" and "+".

The `compare()` method is a static method of the `ExpressionCalculator` class. It compares the priority of two operators. The priority of an operator is determined by the `operat_priority` list, which is an attribute of the `ExpressionCalculator` class. The priority of an operator is determined by its ASCII value minus 40.

In this case, the ASCII value of "*" is 42 and the ASCII value of "+" is 43. Therefore, the priority of "*" is 4 and the priority of "+" is 5.

The `compare()` method returns True if the priority of the first operator is greater than or equal to the priority of the second operator. In this case, the priority of "*" is 4 and the priority of "+" is 5, so the method returns False.

<<<Output>>>
False
