In the test() method, an instance of the EncryptionUtils class is created with the key "key". Then, the caesar_cipher() method is invoked with the input 'abcxyz' and shift 27.

The caesar_cipher() method takes a plaintext and a shift as input. It initializes an empty string ciphertext. Then, it iterates over each character in the plaintext.

If the character is an alphabet, it calculates the ascii_offset based on whether the character is uppercase or lowercase. Then, it calculates the shifted_char by adding the shift to the ascii value of the character and taking modulo 26 to ensure the result is within the range of alphabets. The shifted_char is then appended to the ciphertext.

If the character is not an alphabet, it is appended to the ciphertext as is.

After all characters in the plaintext have been processed, the method returns the ciphertext.

In this case, the plaintext is 'abcxyz' and the shift is 27. The ascii_offset for uppercase letters is 65 and for lowercase letters is 97.

The first character 'a' is shifted to 'b' (65 + 1 = 66, 66 % 26 = 2, 2 + 65 = 67, chr(67) = 'C')
The second character 'b' is shifted to 'c' (66 + 1 = 67, 67 % 26 = 3, 3 + 65 = 68, chr(68) = 'D')
The third character 'c' is shifted to 'd' (67 + 1 = 68, 68 % 26 = 4, 4 + 65 = 69, chr(69) = 'E')
The fourth character 'x' is shifted to 'y' (97 + 1 = 98, 98 % 26 = 4, 4 + 97 = 101, chr(101) = 'e')
The fifth character 'y' is shifted to 'z' (98 + 1 = 99, 99 % 26 = 5, 5 + 97 = 102, chr(102) = 'f')
The sixth character 'z' is shifted to 'a' (99 + 1 = 100, 100 % 26 = 6, 6 + 97 = 103, chr(103) = 'g')

So, the ciphertext is 'bcdEfg'.

<<<Output>>>
'bcdEfg'
