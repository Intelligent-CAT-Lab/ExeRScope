<<<Analysis>>>
In the `test()` method, an instance of the `Server` class is created. Then, the `recv()` method is called with a dictionary as an argument. This dictionary does not contain the "addr" key, which is required by the `recv()` method. Therefore, the `recv()` method returns -1 and the `receive_struct` attribute of the `server` object remains empty.

The `recv()` method checks if the "addr" key is in the `white_list` attribute of the `server` object. Since the "addr" key is not in the `white_list`, the `recv()` method returns False.

The `test()` method then returns a tuple containing the `receive_struct` attribute of the `server` object and the return value of the `recv()` method. Since the `receive_struct` attribute is empty and the `recv()` method returned -1, the `test()` method returns `({}, -1)`.

<<<Output>>>
({}, -1)
