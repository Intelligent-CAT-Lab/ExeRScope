In the test() method, a new instance of the BookManagementDB class is created with the database name "test.db". The database is then connected to and a cursor is created.

The add_book() method is then called with the title "Book to Borrow" and author "Jane Smith". This adds a new book to the database with the title and author provided, and sets the available status to 1 (meaning available).

The borrow_book() method is then called with the id of the book added. This updates the available status of the book with the given id to 0 (meaning unavailable).

Finally, the test() method executes a SQL query to select the available status of the book with id 1. The result of this query is then returned.
