<<<Analysis>>>
In the test() method, a DataStatistics2 object is created with the data [1, 4, 3, 2].
The get_variance() method is then called on this object.
The get_variance() method calculates the variance of the data.
The variance is calculated as the average of the squared differences from the mean.
The mean of the data is calculated as the sum of the data divided by the number of data points.
The sum of the data is calculated using the get_sum() method, which uses the numpy sum() function.
The number of data points is calculated as the length of the data array.
The mean is calculated as the sum divided by the length.
The squared differences from the mean are calculated as the square of the difference between each data point and the mean.
The variance is calculated as the average of these squared differences.
The variance is then rounded to two decimal places using the round() function.
The variance is returned by the get_variance() method.

<<<Output>>>
1.25
