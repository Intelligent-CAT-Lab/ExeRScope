In the test() method, a DataStatistics object is created and the median() method is invoked with the list [2, 5, 1, 3, 4] as the argument.
The purpose of the median() method is to find the middle value in a sorted list of numbers. If the list has an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle numbers.
In this case, the list is [2, 5, 1, 3, 4]. After sorting, the list becomes [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. The list has an odd number of elements, so the median is the middle number.
The middle index is calculated as n // 2, where n is the length of the list. In this case, n = 5, so the middle index is 5 // 2 = 2.
The median is the element at the middle index, which is 3.
