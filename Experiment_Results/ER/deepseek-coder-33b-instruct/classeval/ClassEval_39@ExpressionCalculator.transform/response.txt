<<<Analysis>>>
In the `test()` method of the `Test` class, an instance of `ExpressionCalculator` is created and the `transform()` method of this instance is called with the argument "2 + 3 * 4".

The `transform()` method is defined in the `ExpressionCalculator` class. It takes an expression as input and performs several transformations on it.

The first transformation is to remove all whitespace characters from the expression using the `re.sub()` function.

The second transformation is to replace all occurrences of "=" followed by any character (except a newline) with an empty string.

The third transformation is to replace all occurrences of "-" with "~" if the "-" is the first character of the expression or if it is preceded by a character that is not a number, an operator, or an open parenthesis.

The fourth transformation is to replace the first "~" with a "-" if the first character of the expression is an open parenthesis.

In the given expression "2 + 3 * 4", the first three transformations do not change the expression. The fourth transformation does not apply because the first character is not an open parenthesis.

So, the transformed expression is "2+3*4".

<<<Output>>>
2+3*4
