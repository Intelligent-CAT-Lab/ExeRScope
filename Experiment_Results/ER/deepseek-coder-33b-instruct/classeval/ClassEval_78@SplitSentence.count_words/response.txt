In the `test()` method, an instance of `SplitSentence` class is created and stored in `ss`. Then, the `count_words()` method of `ss` is called with the string "abc def bbb1" as an argument.

The `count_words()` method first removes all non-alphabetic characters from the sentence using a regular expression. The regular expression `[^a-zA-Z\s]` matches any character that is not a letter or a whitespace, and `re.sub()` replaces these characters with an empty string.

After removing non-alphabetic characters, the sentence is split into words using the `split()` method. The `split()` method splits a string into a list where each word is a list item.

Finally, the number of words in the sentence is returned by `len(words)`.

<<<Analysis>>>
In the `count_words()` method, the sentence "abc def bbb1" is passed as an argument.
The `re.sub()` method removes all non-alphabetic characters from the sentence, resulting in "abc def bbb1".
The `split()` method splits the sentence into words, resulting in the list ['abc', 'def', 'bbb1'].
The `len()` function returns the number of words in the list, which is 3.

<<<Output>>>
3
