The output of the `Test.test()` method depends on the randomly generated food position. It will be a tuple of the form `(x, y)`, where `x` and `y` are the coordinates of the food position. The coordinates will be between `0` and `99` (inclusive), as the screen size is `100x100` and the block size is `1`.
