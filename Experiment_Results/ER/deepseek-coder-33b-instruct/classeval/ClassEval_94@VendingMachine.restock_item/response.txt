<<<Analysis>>>
In the test() method, a VendingMachine object is created and its inventory is set to have 10 units of Coke and Pizza each, each priced at $1.25.
Then, the restock_item() method is called on the VendingMachine object with 'Pizza' and 10 as arguments. This method checks if 'Pizza' is in the inventory. If it is, it increases the quantity of 'Pizza' by 10 and returns True. If 'Pizza' is not in the inventory, it returns False.
The inventory after the restock_item() method is called is {'Coke': {'price': 1.25, 'quantity': 10}, 'Pizza': {'price': 1.25, 'quantity': 20}}.
The test() method returns the result of the restock_item() method call and the updated inventory.

<<<Output>>>
(True, {'Coke': {'price': 1.25, 'quantity': 10}, 'Pizza': {'price': 1.25, 'quantity': 20}})
