<<<Analysis>>>
In the test() method, a PageUtil object is created with data and page_size. The data is a list of integers from 1 to 10, and the page_size is 3.

The get_page() method is then called with an invalid page number (0). This is because page numbers start from 1. The method checks if the page_number is less than 1 or greater than the total_pages. If it is, it returns an empty list.

The get_page_info() method is not called in this test, so it is not relevant.

The search() method is not called in this test, so it is not relevant.

The get_page() method is called with the invalid page number (0). Since 0 is less than 1, the method returns an empty list.
