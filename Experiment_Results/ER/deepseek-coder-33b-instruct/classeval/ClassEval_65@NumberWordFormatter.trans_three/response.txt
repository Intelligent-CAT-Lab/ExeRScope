In the `Test.test()` method, an instance of `NumberWordFormatter` is created and stored in the variable `formatter`. Then, the `trans_three()` method of the `formatter` object is called with the argument '006'.

The `trans_three()` method takes a string of three characters and converts it into a word representation. If the first character is '0', it calls the `trans_two()` method with the last two characters of the string. If the last two characters are '00', it returns the word representation of the first character followed by 'HUNDRED'. Otherwise, it returns the word representation of the first character followed by 'HUNDRED AND' and the word representation of the last two characters.

In this case, the input string '006' is passed to the `trans_three()` method. Since the first character is '0', the `trans_two()` method is called with '06' as the argument.

The `trans_two()` method takes a string of two characters and converts it into a word representation. If the first character is '0', it returns the word representation of the last character. If the first character is '1', it returns the word representation of the number from 10 to 19. If the second character is '0', it returns the word representation of the number from 10 to 90 in tens. Otherwise, it returns the word representation of the number from 10 to 90 in tens followed by the word representation of the last character.

In this case, the input string '06' is passed to the `trans_two()` method. Since the first character is '0', the method returns the word representation of '6', which is 'SIX'.

So, the output of the `Test.test()` method is 'SIX'.
