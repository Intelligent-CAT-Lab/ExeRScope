<<<Analysis>>>
In the `test()` method of the `Test` class, a new instance of `PushBoxGame` is created with a game map. The game map is a 2D list where each character represents a different element:
- `#`: wall
- `O`: player
- `X`: box
- `G`: target

The `init_game()` method is called during the initialization of the `PushBoxGame` instance. This method iterates over each element in the map and checks its value. If the element is `O`, it sets the player's position. If the element is `G`, it adds the position to the targets list and increments the target count. If the element is `X`, it adds the position to the boxes list.

After the `init_game()` method is called, the `test()` method returns the game map and the game map itself.

<<<Output>>>
(['#####', '#O  #', '# X #', '#  G#', '#####'], ['#####', '#O  #', '# X #', '#  G#', '#####'])
