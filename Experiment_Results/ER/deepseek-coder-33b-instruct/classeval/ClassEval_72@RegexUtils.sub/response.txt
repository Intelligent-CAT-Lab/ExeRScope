<<<Analysis>>>
In the `Test.test()` method, an instance of the `RegexUtils` class is created and stored in the variable `ru`.
The `sub()` method of the `RegexUtils` class is then called with three arguments:
1. The regular expression pattern `r'\b\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}\b'`, which matches a phone number in the format '123-456-7890'.
2. The replacement string 'phone num'.
3. The text string "1234567890 abiguygusu 8762869876 kjgufwycs 9877629767".

The `sub()` method replaces all occurrences of the phone number pattern in the text with the replacement string.

The `sub()` method uses the `re.sub()` function from the `re` module, which replaces all occurrences of a pattern in a string with a replacement.

In this case, the text string contains two phone numbers: '1234567890' and '9877629767'. Both of these are replaced with the replacement string 'phone num'.

The `sub()` method returns the modified text string.

<<<Output>>>
'phone num abiguygusu 8762869876 kjgufwycs phone num'
