In the `test()` method of the `Test` class, an instance of the `Calculator` class is created. Then, the `apply_operator()` method of the `Calculator` class is called with `operand_stack` and `operator_stack` as arguments.

The `apply_operator()` method pops the last operator from `operator_stack` and applies it to the last two operands in `operand_stack`. The result is then pushed back into `operand_stack`.

In this case, `operand_stack` is initially `[1, 2, 3]` and `operator_stack` is `['+', '*']`.

The first operation to be performed is `'*'`, which is the last operator in `operator_stack`. The last two operands in `operand_stack` are `2` and `3`. The result of `2 * 3` is `6`, which is then pushed back into `operand_stack`.

The `operand_stack` becomes `[1, 6]`.

The second operation to be performed is `'+'`, which is the last operator in `operator_stack`. The last two operands in `operand_stack` are `1` and `6`. The result of `1 + 6` is `7`, which is then pushed back into `operand_stack`.

The `operand_stack` becomes `[7]`.

Finally, the `apply_operator()` method returns `operand_stack` and `operator_stack`.
