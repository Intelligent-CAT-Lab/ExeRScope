<<<Analysis>>>
In the `test()` method, an instance of the `AssessmentSystem` class is created. The `add_student()` method is then called to add a student named "Alice" with a grade of 3 and a major of "Mathematics". The `add_course_score()` method is then called to add a course score of 90 for "Alice" in the "Math" course.

The return value of the `test()` method is the score of "Alice" in the "Math" course. This is accessed by `assessment_system.students['Alice']['courses']['Math']`.

The `students` dictionary is a dictionary of dictionaries. The outer dictionary has keys that are the names of the students. The inner dictionaries have keys 'name', 'grade', 'major', and 'courses'. The 'courses' value is another dictionary where the keys are the names of the courses and the values are the scores.

So, `assessment_system.students['Alice']['courses']['Math']` accesses the 'courses' dictionary for "Alice", then accesses the 'Math' key in that dictionary to get the score.

<<<Output>>>
90
