<<<Analysis>>>
In the test() method, a new ShoppingCart object is created.
The add_item() method is called twice, adding two items to the shopping cart. The first item is an apple with a price of 1 and a quantity of 1. The second item is a banana with a price of 2 and a quantity of 1.
After adding the items, the total_price() method is called. This method calculates the total price of all items in the shopping cart.
The total price is calculated by iterating over all items in the cart, multiplying the price of each item by its quantity, and then summing these values.
In this case, the total price is calculated as follows:
1 (price of apple) * 1 (quantity of apple) + 2 (price of banana) * 1 (quantity of banana) = 1 + 2 = 3
So, the total price of the items in the shopping cart is 3.

<<<Output>>>
3
