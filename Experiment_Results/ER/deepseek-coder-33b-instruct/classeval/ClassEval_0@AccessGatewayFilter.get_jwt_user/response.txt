In the `Test.test()` method, an instance of `AccessGatewayFilter` is created and a request is defined. This request contains a JWT token that is expired (5 days ago). The `get_jwt_user()` method is then called with this request.

The `get_jwt_user()` method first extracts the token from the request. It then splits the token into the user's name and the date string. It converts this date string into a datetime object and checks if it is more than 3 days old. If it is, it returns None. If it is not, it returns the token.

In the test case, the token is expired (5 days ago), so the `get_jwt_user()` method returns None.

<<<Output>>>
None
