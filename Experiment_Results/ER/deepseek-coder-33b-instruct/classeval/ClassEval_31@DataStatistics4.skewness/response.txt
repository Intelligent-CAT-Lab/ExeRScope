In the test() method, the DataStatistics4.skewness([1, 1, 1]) method is invoked. The purpose of this method is to calculate the skewness of a given data set. In this case, the data set is [1, 1, 1].

The skewness is a measure of the asymmetry of the probability distribution of a real-valued random variable about its mean. In other words, it measures the extent to which the data is skewed or distorted from a normal distribution.

In the skewness() method, the variable n is assigned the length of the data set, which is 3 in this case. The mean of the data set is calculated by summing all the elements in the data set and dividing by n.

The variance of the data set is calculated by subtracting the mean from each element in the data set, squaring the result, summing all these squared differences, and dividing by n.

The standard deviation of the data set is calculated by taking the square root of the variance.

The skewness of the data set is calculated by subtracting the mean from each element in the data set, cubing the result, summing all these cubed differences, multiplying by n, and dividing by ((n - 1) * (n - 2) * std_deviation ** 3). If the standard deviation is 0, the skewness is also 0.

In this case, the data set is [1, 1, 1], so the mean is 1, the variance is 0, the standard deviation is 0, and the skewness is also 0.
