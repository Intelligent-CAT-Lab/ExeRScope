In the test() method, an instance of the Statistics3 class is created and the mode() method is invoked with the list [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5] as an argument.

The mode() method counts the frequency of each value in the list and stores it in a dictionary. It then finds the maximum count and returns the values that have this maximum count.

In this case, the list [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5] has two values (3 and 4) that appear twice, and two values (1, 2, and 5) that appear once. The maximum count is 2, so the mode() method returns [3, 4].
