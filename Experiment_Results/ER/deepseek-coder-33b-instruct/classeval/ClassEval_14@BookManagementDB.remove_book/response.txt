<<<Analysis>>>
In the `test()` method, a new instance of `BookManagementDB` is created with the database name "test.db". The `create_table()` method is called to create a table named "books" if it doesn't already exist.

The `add_book()` method is then called to add a book with the title "Book to Remove" and author "John Doe". The `remove_book()` method is then called to remove the book with id 1.

After the book is removed, the `cursor.execute()` method is used to select the book with id 1 from the "books" table. The `fetchone()` method is then used to retrieve the result of the query.

Since the book with id 1 was just removed, the `fetchone()` method should return `None`.

<<<Output>>>
None
