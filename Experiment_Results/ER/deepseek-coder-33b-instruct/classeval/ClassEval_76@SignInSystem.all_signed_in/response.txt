<<<Analysis>>>
In the test() method, a new SignInSystem object is created.
The add_user() method is called with "aaa" as the argument. This adds "aaa" to the users dictionary and sets their status to False (not signed in).
The sign_in() method is called with "aaa" as the argument. This sets "aaa"'s status to True (signed in).
The all_signed_in() method is then called. This checks if all users are signed in. Since there is only one user "aaa" and "aaa" is signed in, the method returns True.
<<<Output>>>
True
