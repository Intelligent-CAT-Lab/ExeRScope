In the `test()` method, an instance of `NLPDataProcessor` is created and stored in `self.processor`.

The `process()` method of `NLPDataProcessor` is then called with `string_list` as the argument.

The `process()` method first calls `construct_stop_word_list()` to get a list of stop words. In this case, the stop words are 'a', 'an', and 'the'.

Then, `remove_stop_words()` is called with `string_list` and `stop_word_list` as arguments. This method iterates over each string in `string_list`, splits each string into words, and checks if each word is in `stop_word_list`. If a word is in `stop_word_list`, it is removed from the string.

The processed strings are then appended to `answer`, which is returned by `remove_stop_words()`.

Finally, `process()` returns `answer`, which is the list of processed strings.

In this case, the `string_list` is ['This is a test.', 'This is an apple.', 'This is the dog.']. After processing, the `answer` is [['This', 'is', 'test.'], ['This', 'is', 'apple.'], ['This', 'is', 'dog.']], which is the expected output.

<<<Output>>>
([['This', 'is', 'test.'], ['This', 'is', 'apple.'], ['This', 'is', 'dog.']], [['This', 'is', 'test.'], ['This', 'is', 'apple.'], ['This', 'is', 'dog.']])
