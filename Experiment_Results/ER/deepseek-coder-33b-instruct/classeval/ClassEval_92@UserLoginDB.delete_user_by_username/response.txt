<<<Analysis>>>
In the `test()` method of the `Test` class, a SQLite database is created and a `UserLoginDB` object is instantiated with this database.

The `insert_user()` method is then called with the username 'user2' and password 'pass2'. This inserts a new user into the 'users' table of the database.

The `delete_user_by_username()` method is then called with the username 'user2'. This deletes the user from the 'users' table of the database.

Finally, the `search_user_by_username()` method is called with the username 'user2'. This searches for the user in the 'users' table of the database and returns the user if found, otherwise it returns None.

Since the user 'user2' was inserted and then deleted, the `search_user_by_username()` method should return None.

<<<Output>>>
None
