<<<Analysis>>>
In the `test()` method, an instance of the `MahjongConnect` class is created with a board size of 4x4 and icons 'a', 'b', and 'c'. The board is then manually set to a specific configuration.

The `remove_icons()` method is then called with the positions (3, 0) and (2, 0). This method sets the icons at these positions to ' '.

Finally, the updated board is returned.

<<<Output>>>
[['a', 'b', 'c', ' '],
 ['a', 'b', 'c', 'a'],
 ['a', 'b', 'c', 'a'],
 ['a', 'b', 'c', 'a']]
