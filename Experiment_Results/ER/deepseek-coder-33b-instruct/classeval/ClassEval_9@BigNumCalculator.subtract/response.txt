In the test() method, an instance of BigNumCalculator is created and the subtract() method is invoked with two large numbers as arguments. The purpose of this method is to subtract two numbers represented as strings.

The subtract() method first checks if the length of num1 is less than num2. If true, it swaps num1 and num2 and sets a flag negative to True. If the lengths are equal, it compares num1 and num2 lexicographically. If num1 is less than num2, it swaps num1 and num2 and sets negative to True. If num1 is not less than num2, it sets negative to False.

Next, it pads the shorter number with zeros to make both numbers the same length.

Then, it initializes a variable borrow to 0. It iterates over the digits of the numbers from right to left. For each pair of digits, it subtracts the second digit and the borrow from the first digit. If the result is negative, it adds 10 to the result and sets borrow to 1. Otherwise, it sets borrow to 0.

Finally, it removes leading zeros from the result and if the result is negative, it prepends a '-' to the result.

In this case, num1 = '12345678901234567' and num2 = '98765432109876543210'. The result will be '-98765432108641975321'.

<<<Output>>>
'-98765432108641975321'
