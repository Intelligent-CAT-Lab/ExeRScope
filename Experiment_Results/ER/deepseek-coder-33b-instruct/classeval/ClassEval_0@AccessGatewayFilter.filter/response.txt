In the `test()` method, an instance of `AccessGatewayFilter` is created and a request is defined. This request is passed to the `filter()` method of the `AccessGatewayFilter` instance.

The `filter()` method first checks if the request URI starts with "/api" or "/login". In this case, it does not, so it proceeds to the next step.

Next, it attempts to get the JWT user from the request. The JWT user is extracted from the request headers. If the JWT starts with the user's name and the date in the JWT is older than 3 days, it returns None. Otherwise, it returns the token.

In this case, the JWT does not start with the user's name, so it proceeds to the next step. It then checks if the user's level is greater than 2. In this case, it is, so it proceeds to the next step.

The `set_current_user_info_and_log()` method is called, which sets the current user's information and logs it. It constructs a message by concatenating the user's name, host, and the current date and time. The message is then logged with a level of 1.

Finally, the `filter()` method returns True.
