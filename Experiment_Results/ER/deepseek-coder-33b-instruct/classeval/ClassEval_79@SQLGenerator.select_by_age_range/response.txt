<<<Analysis>>>
In the test() method, an instance of SQLGenerator is created with the table name 'table1'.
The select_by_age_range() method is then called with the arguments 50 and 60.
The select_by_age_range() method generates a SQL SELECT statement with a WHERE clause that filters for records where the 'age' field is between 50 and 60.
The generated SQL statement is:
"SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE age BETWEEN 50 AND 60;"
This SQL statement is then returned by the select_by_age_range() method.
<<<Output>>>
"SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE age BETWEEN 50 AND 60;"
