In the test() method, an instance of the CurrencyConverter class is created and assigned to the variable cc.
Then, the get_supported_currencies() method is called on the cc object. This method returns a list of all the keys in the rates dictionary, which are the supported currencies.
In the CurrencyConverter class, the rates dictionary is defined with the supported currencies and their corresponding rates.
The get_supported_currencies() method simply returns the keys of this dictionary.
