<<<Analysis>>>
In the test() method, a new instance of the TicTacToe class is created and assigned to the variable ttt.
The make_move() method is not called on this instance, so the board is still empty.
The is_board_full() method is then called on the ttt instance. This method checks each row in the board to see if there is any space left. If there is, it returns False. If there isn't, it returns True.
In this case, since the board is empty, the is_board_full() method will return False.

<<<Output>>>
False
