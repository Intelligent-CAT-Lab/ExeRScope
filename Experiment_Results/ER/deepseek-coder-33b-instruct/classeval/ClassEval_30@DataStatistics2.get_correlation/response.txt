<<<Analysis>>>
In the test() method, a DataStatistics2 object is created with the data [11, 14, 13, 12].
The get_correlation() method is then called on this object.
The get_correlation() method calculates the correlation matrix of the data.
The correlation matrix is a square matrix that contains the correlation coefficients between each pair of elements in the data.
In this case, the data is a 1-dimensional array with 4 elements. Therefore, the correlation matrix will be a 4x4 matrix.
The np.corrcoef() function from the numpy library is used to calculate the correlation matrix.
The rowvar parameter is set to False, which means that each row in the data is a variable, and each column is an observation.
The output of the np.corrcoef() function is a 2D array, which is the correlation matrix of the data.
