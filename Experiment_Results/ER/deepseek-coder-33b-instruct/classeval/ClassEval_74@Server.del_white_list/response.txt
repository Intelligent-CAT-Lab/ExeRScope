<<<Analysis>>>
In the test() method, a Server object is created. Then the del_white_list() method is called with the argument 22.
The del_white_list() method checks if the given address (22) is in the white_list. If it is not, it returns False. If it is, it removes the address from the white_list and returns the updated white_list.
Since the white_list is initially empty, the address 22 is not in the white_list, so the method returns False.
<<<Output>>>
False
