<<<Analysis>>>
In the test() method, an instance of UrlPath is created and assigned to the variable url_path.
Then, the add() method is called on url_path with the argument '123'.
The add() method appends the result of fix_path('123') to the segments list.
The fix_path() method takes a string path as input, removes leading and trailing slashes, and returns the result. In this case, it returns '123'.
So, the segments list of url_path will be ['123'].
Finally, the test() method returns the segments list of url_path.

<<<Output>>>
['123']
