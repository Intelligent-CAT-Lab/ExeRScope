<<<Analysis>>>
In the `test()` method of the `Test` class, an instance of `ExpressionCalculator` is created and stored in `self.expression_calculator`. Then, the `_calculate()` method of `self.expression_calculator` is called with the arguments "2", "3", and "*".

The `_calculate()` method takes three arguments: `first_value`, `second_value`, and `current_op`. It performs a mathematical operation based on the `current_op` argument. In this case, `current_op` is "*", which means the method will perform a multiplication operation.

The `first_value` and `second_value` are converted to `Decimal` objects to ensure that the operation is performed with high precision. The result of the operation is then returned.

In this case, the operation is 2 * 3, which equals 6. Therefore, the return value of `self.expression_calculator._calculate("2", "3", "*")` is `Decimal(6.0)`.

<<<Output>>>
Decimal('6.0')
