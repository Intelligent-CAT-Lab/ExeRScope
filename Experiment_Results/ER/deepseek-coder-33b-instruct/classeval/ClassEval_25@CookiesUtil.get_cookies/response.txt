<<<Analysis>>>
In the test() method, an instance of the CookiesUtil class is created with the filename 'cookies.json' as the argument.
The get_cookies() method is then called on this instance, with the response dictionary as the argument.
The get_cookies() method extracts the 'cookies' key from the response dictionary and assigns it to the self.cookies attribute of the CookiesUtil instance.
The _save_cookies() method is then called, which writes the cookies to the 'cookies.json' file.
Finally, the cookies attribute of the CookiesUtil instance is returned.

The response dictionary contains several 'cookies' keys, but the get_cookies() method only extracts the 'cookies' key and assigns it to self.cookies. Therefore, the return value of the test() method will be the 'cookies' key of the response dictionary.

<<<Output>>>
{'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2'}
