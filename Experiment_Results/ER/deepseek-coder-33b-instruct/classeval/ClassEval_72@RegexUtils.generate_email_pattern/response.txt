<<<Analysis>>>
In the `Test.test()` method, an instance of the `RegexUtils` class is created and stored in the variable `ru`. The `generate_email_pattern()` method is then called on this instance to generate a regular expression pattern for matching email addresses. This pattern is stored in the variable `pat`.

The `match()` method of the `RegexUtils` class is then called with `pat` and the string 'iustd87t2euh@163.com' as arguments. This method checks if the string matches the pattern. If it does, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

The regular expression pattern `pat` is designed to match email addresses. It matches any string that starts with one or more alphanumeric characters, followed by an '@', followed by one or more alphanumeric characters, a '.', and finally two or more alphanumeric characters. The string 'iustd87t2euh@163.com' matches this pattern, so the `match()` method returns `True`.

<<<Output>>>
