In the test() method, a VendingMachine object is created. The inventory of the vending machine is set to have 0 Coke and 10 Pizza.
Then, the display_items() method is called on the vending machine.

The display_items() method checks if the inventory is empty. If it is, it returns False. If it's not, it iterates over each item in the inventory. For each item, it creates a string in the format "{item_name} - ${item_price} [{item_quantity}]" and appends it to a list.

In this case, the inventory has 0 Coke and 10 Pizza. So, the list will contain two strings: "Coke - $1.25 [0]" and "Pizza - $1.25 [10]".

Finally, the method joins the list of strings with newline characters and returns the resulting string.

<<<Output>>>
Coke - $1.25 [0]
Pizza - $1.25 [10]
