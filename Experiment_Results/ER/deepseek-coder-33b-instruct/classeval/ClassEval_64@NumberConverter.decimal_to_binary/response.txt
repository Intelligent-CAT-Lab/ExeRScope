<<<Analysis>>>
In the test() method, the NumberConverter.decimal_to_binary(169815) method is invoked. The purpose of this method is to convert a decimal number to a binary number. In this case, the decimal number is 169815.
The decimal_to_binary() method uses the built-in bin() function to convert the decimal number to a binary number. The bin() function returns a string that starts with '0b' to indicate that it's a binary number, so we use [2:] to get rid of the '0b'.
The binary number of 169815 is '1100101011111111111'.
<<<Output>>>
'1100101011111111111'
