In the test() method, an instance of URLHandler is created with the URL "https://www.baidu.com/s?wd=aaa&rsv_spt=1#bbb".
The get_fragment() method is then called on this instance.

The get_fragment() method works by finding the index of the "#" character in the URL. If the "#" character is found, it returns the substring of the URL that comes after the "#" character. If the "#" character is not found, it returns None.

In this case, the "#" character is found at index 41 in the URL. Therefore, the get_fragment() method returns the substring of the URL that comes after the "#" character, which is "bbb".

<<<Output>>>
"bbb"
