In the `Test.test()` method, a new instance of the `MinesweeperGame` class is created with the parameters `1` and `4`. This means that the game board will be a 1x1 board with 4 mines.

The `generate_playerMap()` method is then called on this instance. This method generates a 2D list (a list of lists) representing the player's view of the game board. Each cell in the board is initialized to '-'.

The output of this method is a 1x1 list of lists, where each sublist contains a single element, '-'.
