<<<Analysis>>>
In the test() method, an instance of the BalancedBrackets class is created with the input string "[a](b){c}".
The clear_expr() method is then called on this instance, which removes any characters from the string that are not brackets.
The clear_expr() method works by iterating over each character in the string, and if the character is a left or right bracket, it is kept in the string. All other characters are removed.
In this case, the string "[a](b){c}" is reduced to "(b)".
The test() method then returns the value of the expr attribute of the BalancedBrackets instance.
<<<Output>>>
(b)
