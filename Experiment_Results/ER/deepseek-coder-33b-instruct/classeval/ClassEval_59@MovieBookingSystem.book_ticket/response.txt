<<<Analysis>>>
In the test() method, an instance of the MovieBookingSystem class is created and assigned to the variable self.system.
Then, a movie named 'Batman' is added to the system with a price of 49.9, a start time of '17:05', an end time of '19:25', and a seating arrangement of 3x3.
The movie 'Batman' is then booked for the seat (0, 0).
The movie 'Batman' is then attempted to be booked for the same seat (0, 0) again.
The method returns a tuple containing the result of the second booking attempt and the status of the seat (0, 0) after the second booking attempt.

The add_movie() method creates a dictionary for the movie with the given name, price, start time, end time, and a 2D numpy array of zeros for the seats.
The book_ticket() method iterates over the movies in the system. If it finds a movie with the given name, it attempts to book the given seats. If a seat is available (represented by a 0 in the numpy array), it sets the seat to 1 (representing a booked seat) and returns "Booking success." If a seat is not available (represented by a 1 in the numpy array), it returns "Booking failed." If it does not find a movie with the given name, it returns "Movie not found."
The available_movies() method iterates over the movies in the system. If it finds a movie whose start time is on or after the given start time and whose end time is on or before the given end time, it adds the movie's name to the list of available movies. It then returns the list of available movies.

<<<Output>>>
("Booking failed.", 1)
