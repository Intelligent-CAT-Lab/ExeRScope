<<<Analysis>>>
In the test() method, a Thermostat object t is created with current_temperature=25, target_temperature=25, and mode='cool'.
The auto_check_conflict() method is then called on this object. This method checks if the current mode is the same as the mode that would be set based on the current and target temperatures.
In this case, the current temperature is equal to the target temperature, so the mode is 'cool'. Therefore, the method returns True and the mode, which is 'cool'.
<<<Output>>>
(True, 'cool')
