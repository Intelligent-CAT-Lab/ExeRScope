<<<Analysis>>>
In the test() method, an instance of the RegexUtils class is created and stored in the variable `ru`.
The `findall()` method of the `ru` object is then called with two arguments: a regular expression pattern and a string.
The pattern `r'\b\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}\b'` is a regular expression that matches a phone number in the format of XXX-XXX-XXXX, where X is a digit.
The string `"abiguygusu  111-111-1111 kjgufwycs 987-762-9767"` contains two phone numbers.
The `findall()` method scans the string and returns all non-overlapping matches of the pattern in the string as a list of strings.
In this case, the method will return `['111-111-1111', '987-762-9767']`.

<<<Output>>>
['111-111-1111', '987-762-9767']
