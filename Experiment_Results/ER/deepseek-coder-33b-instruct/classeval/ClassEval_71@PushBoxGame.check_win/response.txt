<<<Analysis>>>
In the `test()` method of the `Test` class, a new instance of `PushBoxGame` is created with a game map. The game map is a 2D list where each character represents a different element:
- `#`: wall
- `O`: player
- `X`: box
- `G`: target
- ` `: empty space

The `init_game()` method is called during the initialization of the `PushBoxGame` instance. This method iterates over each element in the map and checks its value. If the element is `O`, it sets the player's position. If the element is `G`, it adds the position to the targets list and increments the target count. If the element is `X`, it adds the position to the boxes list.

The `check_win()` method is then called. This method iterates over each box and checks if it is in the targets list. If it is, it increments a counter. If the counter is equal to the target count, it sets `is_game_over` to `True`. Finally, it returns `is_game_over`.

In this case, the game map is a 5x5 grid with a player at (1, 1), a box at (2, 2), and a target at (3, 2). The `check_win()` method will return `False` because the box is not on the target yet.
