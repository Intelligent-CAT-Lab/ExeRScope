<<<Analysis>>>
In the test() method, an instance of the ArrangementCalculator class is created with the input [1, 2].
The select() method is then called on this instance. The purpose of this method is to generate all possible permutations of the input list.
In the select() method, an empty list result is initialized.
A for loop iterates over each permutation of the input list.
For each permutation, it is converted to a list and appended to the result list.
After the loop completes, the method returns result, which is a list of all possible permutations of the input list.
In this case, the input list is [1, 2], so the result is [[1, 2], [2, 1]].
<<<Output>>>
([[1, 2], [2, 1]], [[1, 2], [2, 1]])
