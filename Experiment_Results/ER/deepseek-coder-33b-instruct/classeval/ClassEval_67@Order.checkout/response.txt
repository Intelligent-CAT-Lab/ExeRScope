In the `test()` method, an instance of the `Order` class is created. The `menu` attribute of the `Order` instance is populated with three dishes, each with a name, price, and count. The `sales` attribute of the `Order` instance is populated with the sales for each dish.

The `checkout()` method is then called on the `Order` instance. This method checks if there are any selected dishes. If there are none, it returns `False`. If there are selected dishes, it calculates the total cost of the order by calling the `calculate_total()` method. The `calculate_total()` method iterates over each selected dish, multiplies the price of the dish by the count of the dish and the sales for the dish, and adds this to the total.

The `checkout()` method then clears the `selected_dishes` attribute and returns the total cost.

In this case, there are no selected dishes, so the `checkout()` method returns `False`.

<<<Output>>>
False
