<<<Analysis>>>
In the test() method, a new VendingMachine object is created.
The add_item() method is called four times to add items to the vending machine's inventory.
The first call adds 10 Coke items at a price of 1.25 each.
The second call adds 10 Pizza items at a price of 1.25 each.
The third call tries to add another 10 Pizza items at a price of 1.25 each. However, since the item already exists in the inventory, the quantity is increased instead of adding a new item.
The fourth call tries to add another 10 Coke items at a price of 1.25 each. However, since the item already exists in the inventory, the quantity is increased instead of adding a new item.
The inventory dictionary is returned by the test() method.
<<<Output>>>
{'Coke': {'price': 1.25, 'quantity': 20}, 'Pizza': {'price': 1.25, 'quantity': 20}}
