<<<Analysis>>>
In the `test()` method, a customer dictionary and a cart list are created. The customer has a fidelity of 1200 and the cart contains two items: 'product1' with a quantity of 20 and a price of 10.0, and 'product2' with a quantity of 5 and a price of 5.0.

An instance of the `DiscountStrategy` class is created with the customer, cart, and `BulkItemPromo` as arguments. The `BulkItemPromo` is a static method that calculates a discount based on the quantity of items in the cart.

The `due()` method is called on the `order` object. This method calculates the total due by subtracting the discount from the total. The discount is calculated by calling the promotion method on the order object.

In the `BulkItemPromo()` method, a discount is calculated for each item in the cart where the quantity is 20 or more. The discount is 10% of the total price of the item.

In this case, the `BulkItemPromo()` method will be called on the `order` object, and it will return a discount of 20.0 for the 'product1' item.

<<<Output>>>
(20.0, 20.0)
