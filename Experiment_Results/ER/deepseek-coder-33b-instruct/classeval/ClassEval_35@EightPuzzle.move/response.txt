<<<Analysis>>>
In the `test()` method, the `EightPuzzle` class is instantiated with an initial state. The `move()` method is then called with the initial state and the direction 'left'.

The `move()` method takes in a state and a direction as parameters. It first finds the blank tile in the state using the `find_blank()` method. It then creates a copy of the state and swaps the blank tile with the tile in the specified direction.

In this case, the initial state is `[[2, 3, 4], [5, 0, 1], [6, 8, 7]]`. The blank tile is at position (1, 1) (0-indexed). When the 'left' direction is specified, the blank tile is swapped with the tile at position (1, 0).

The expected result after the move is `[[2, 3, 4], [0, 5, 1], [6, 8, 7]]`.

<<<Output>>>
([[2, 3, 4], [0, 5, 1], [6, 8, 7]], [[2, 3, 4], [0, 5, 1], [6, 8, 7]])
