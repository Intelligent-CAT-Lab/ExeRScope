<<<Analysis>>>
In the `test()` method, an instance of the `JobMarketplace` class is created. Two resumes are added to the `resumes` list and one job listing is added to the `job_listings` list.

Then, the `get_job_applicants()` method is called with the first job listing as an argument. This method iterates over all the resumes in the `resumes` list and checks if they match the requirements of the job listing.

In the `matches_requirements()` method, it checks if each skill in the resume is in the job listing's requirements. If a skill is not in the requirements, it returns False. If all skills are in the requirements, it returns True.

In this case, the first resume matches the job listing's requirements, but the second resume does not. Therefore, the `get_job_applicants()` method returns a list with the first resume.

<<<Output>>>
[{'name': 'Tom', 'skills': ['skill1', 'skill2'], 'experience': 'experience'}]
