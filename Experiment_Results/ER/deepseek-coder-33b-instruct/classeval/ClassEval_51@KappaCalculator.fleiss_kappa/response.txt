In the `test()` method, the `KappaCalculator.fleiss_kappa()` method is invoked with the following parameters:

- testData: a 2D list of integers representing the data to be processed.
- N: the number of raters (10 in this case).
- k: the number of categories (5 in this case).
- n: the total number of ratings (14 in this case).

The `fleiss_kappa()` method calculates the Fleiss' kappa statistic, a measure of inter-rater agreement for qualitative (categorical) items.

The method first converts the input data into a numpy matrix. It then initializes variables to hold the sum of the data, the sum of the diagonal elements, and the sum of the rows and columns.

The method then iterates over each row in the data matrix. For each row, it calculates the sum of the squares of the elements and subtracts the total number of ratings from it. This value is then divided by the product of the total number of ratings and the number of categories, and added to the sum of the diagonal elements.

After the loop, the method calculates the proportion of the diagonal elements and the proportion of the total ratings. It then calculates the expected proportion of the total ratings for each category.

Finally, the method calculates the Fleiss' kappa statistic and returns it.

The output of the `fleiss_kappa()` method is a float representing the Fleiss' kappa statistic.
