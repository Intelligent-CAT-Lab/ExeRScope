In the `test()` method of the `Test` class, an instance of `HtmlUtil` is created and the `extract_code_from_html_text()` method is called with a string of HTML code as an argument.

The `extract_code_from_html_text()` method first calls the `format_line_html_text()` method with the same HTML code as an argument. This method formats the HTML code by replacing certain elements with special markers and extracting the text from the code tags.

In the `format_line_html_text()` method, the BeautifulSoup library is used to parse the HTML code. The code tags (`pre` and `blockquote`) are found and replaced with the `CODE_MARK`. Then, the text of the code tags is extracted and returned.

In the `extract_code_from_html_text()` method, the text with the code tags is checked for the presence of the `CODE_MARK`. If it is not present, an empty list is returned. If it is present, the code tags are found again and the text of each code tag is extracted and added to a list. This list is then returned.

In the test HTML code, there are two code tags. The first one contains the string `'print(\'Hello, world!\')'` and the second one contains the string `'for i in range(2):\nprint(i)'`.

So, the return value of `Test.test()` would be a list containing these two strings: `['print(\'Hello, world!\')', 'for i in range(2):\nprint(i)']`.

<<<Output>>>
['print(\'Hello, world!\')', 'for i in range(2):\nprint(i)']
