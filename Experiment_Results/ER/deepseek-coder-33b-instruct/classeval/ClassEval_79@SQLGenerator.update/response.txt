In the test() method, an instance of SQLGenerator is created with the table name 'table1'.
The update() method is then called on this instance, with two parameters: a dictionary of fields and their new values, and a condition string.
The update() method constructs an SQL UPDATE statement using the provided data and condition.
The SQL statement is constructed as follows:
- The fields and their new values are extracted from the dictionary and joined into a string with the format "field1 = 'new_value1', field2 = 'new_value2', ...".
- The SQL statement is constructed as "UPDATE table_name SET field1 = 'new_value1', field2 = 'new_value2', ... WHERE condition".
- The condition string is appended to the end of the SQL statement.
- The method returns the constructed SQL statement.

In this case, the update() method is called with the following parameters:
- data = {'field1': 'new_value1', 'field2': 'new_value2', 'field3': 'new_value3', 'field4': 'new_value4'}
- condition = "field5 = value1"

The SQL statement constructed by the update() method is:
"UPDATE table1 SET field1 = 'new_value1', field2 = 'new_value2', field3 = 'new_value3', field4 = 'new_value4' WHERE field5 = value1;"

<<<Output>>>
"UPDATE table1 SET field1 = 'new_value1', field2 = 'new_value2', field3 = 'new_value3', field4 = 'new_value4' WHERE field5 = value1;"
