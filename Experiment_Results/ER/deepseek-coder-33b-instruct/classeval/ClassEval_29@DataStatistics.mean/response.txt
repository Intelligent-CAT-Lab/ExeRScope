In the test() method, a DataStatistics object is created and the mean() method is invoked with the list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] as the argument.

The mean() method calculates the average of the numbers in the list. It does this by summing up all the numbers in the list and then dividing by the number of elements in the list. The result is then rounded to 2 decimal places.

In this case, the sum of the numbers in the list is 15, and there are 5 elements in the list. So, the mean is 15 / 5 = 3.

The round() function is used to round the result to 2 decimal places, but since 3 is an integer, it remains the same.

So, the output of the test() method is 3.
