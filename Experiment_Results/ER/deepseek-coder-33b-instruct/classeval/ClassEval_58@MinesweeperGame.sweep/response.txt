<<<Analysis>>>
In the `test()` method, a new instance of the `MinesweeperGame` class is created with `n=3` and `k=1`. The `minesweeper_map` and `player_map` are then manually set to specific values.

The `sweep(0, 0)` method is then called on this instance. This method checks if the cell at the given coordinates (0, 0) contains a mine. In this case, it does not, so it updates the `player_map` at the same coordinates with the value from the `minesweeper_map`, increments the `score` by 1, and returns the `player_map`.

The `check_won()` method is then called to check if the game has been won. In this case, it returns `False` because not all cells have been swept.

Finally, the `test()` method returns a tuple containing the result of the `sweep()` method call and the current `score`.

<<<Output>>>
(False, 1)
