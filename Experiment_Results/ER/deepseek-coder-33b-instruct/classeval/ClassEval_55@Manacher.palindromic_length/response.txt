In the test() method, an instance of the Manacher class is created with the input string 'ababaxse'. The palindromic_length() method of this instance is then called with the parameters 2, 1, and 'a|b|a|b|a|x|s|e'.

The palindromic_length() method takes three parameters: center, diff, and string. It checks if the character at the position (center - diff) or (center + diff) in the string is not equal to the character at the center position. If it is not equal, it returns 0. If it is equal, it recursively calls itself with the same center, diff + 1, and string, and adds 1 to the result.

In this case, the method is called with the parameters 2, 1, and 'a|b|a|b|a|x|s|e'. The character at position 2 - 1 = 1 is 'a', and the character at position 2 + 1 = 3 is also 'a'. So, the method returns 1 + the result of the recursive call with the same parameters.

The recursive call is made with the parameters 2, 2, and 'a|b|a|b|a|x|s|e'. The character at position 2 - 2 = 0 is 'a', and the character at position 2 + 2 = 4 is also 'a'. So, the method returns 1 + the result of the recursive call with the same parameters.

The recursive call is made with the parameters 2, 3, and 'a|b|a|b|a|x|s|e'. The character at position 2 - 3 = -1 is out of range, so the method returns 0.

So, the method returns 1 + 1 + 0 = 2.
