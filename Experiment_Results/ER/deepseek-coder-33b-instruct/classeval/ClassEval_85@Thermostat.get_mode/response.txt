<<<Analysis>>>
In the test() method, a Thermostat object t is created with initial current temperature 20, target temperature 25, and mode 'heat'.
The get_mode() method is then called on this object, which returns the current mode of the thermostat.
In the Thermostat class, the get_mode() method simply returns the value of the mode attribute of the object.
In the constructor of the Thermostat class, the mode attribute is set to the value of the mode parameter passed to the constructor.
Therefore, the mode of the Thermostat object t is 'heat'.
<<<Output>>>
'heat'
