<<<Analysis>>>
In the test() method, a MinesweeperGame object is created with n=3 and k=1. The minesweeper_map and player_map are manually set to specific values.

The check_won() method checks if the player has won the game. It iterates over each cell in the player's map. If a cell is still unrevealed ('-') and not a mine ('X') in the minesweeper_map, it returns False. If no such cell is found, it means the player has won, so it returns True.

In this case, the player_map is:
[['-', '-', '-'], ['-', 1, '-'], ['-', '-', '-']]

The minesweeper_map is:
[['X', 1, 0], [1, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0]]

The check_won() method will return False because there is a cell in the player_map that is still unrevealed ('-') and not a mine ('X') in the minesweeper_map.

<<<Output>>>
False
