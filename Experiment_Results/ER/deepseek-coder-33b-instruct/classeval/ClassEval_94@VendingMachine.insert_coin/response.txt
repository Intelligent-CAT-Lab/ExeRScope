In the test() method, a VendingMachine object is created. The balance of the vending machine is set to 1.25. Then, the insert_coin() method is called three times with the argument 1.25, which adds 1.25 to the balance each time.

The insert_coin() method adds the amount passed to it to the balance and returns the new balance. So, after the first call, the balance is 2.50. After the second call, the balance is 3.75. After the third call, the balance is 5.00.

Finally, the balance of the vending machine is returned by the test() method.

<<<Output>>>
5.00
