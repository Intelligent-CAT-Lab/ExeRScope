<<<Analysis>>>
In the test() method, a new Chat object is created and assigned to the variable chat. The chat object has two users 'John' and 'Mary'.
The send_message() method is then called with the arguments 'Amy', 'Amy', 'Hello'. This method checks if the sender and receiver are in the users dictionary. In this case, 'Amy' is not in the users dictionary, so the method returns False and does not add the message to the users dictionary.
The return value of the test() method is a tuple containing the return value of the send_message() method and the users dictionary of the chat object.
<<<Output>>>
(False, {'John': [], 'Mary': []})
