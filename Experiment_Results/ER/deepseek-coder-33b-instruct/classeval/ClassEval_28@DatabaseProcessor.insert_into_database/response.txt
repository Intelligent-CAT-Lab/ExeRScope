<<<Analysis>>>
In the `test()` method of the `Test` class, the following steps are performed:

1. The database name is set to "test.db".
2. An instance of the `DatabaseProcessor` class is created with the database name as an argument.
3. A table named "test_table" is created with keys 'name' and 'age'.
4. The `insert_into_database()` method is called to insert data into the table. The data is a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a row to be inserted.
5. A connection to the database is established.
6. A SELECT query is executed to fetch all rows from the table.
7. The length of the result (which is the number of rows in the table), the length of the data (which is the number of rows that were inserted), and the age of the first row (which is the third element in the first row) are returned.

<<<Output>>>
(2, 2, 'John')
