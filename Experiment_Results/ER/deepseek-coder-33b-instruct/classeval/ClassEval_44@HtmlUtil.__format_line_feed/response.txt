<<<Analysis>>>
In the `test()` method of the `Test` class, the `HtmlUtil._HtmlUtil__format_line_feed('aaa\n\n\n\n')` method is invoked. The purpose of this method is to replace multiple consecutive newline characters with a single newline character.

The `__format_line_feed()` method is a static method of the `HtmlUtil` class. It takes a string as input and replaces multiple consecutive newline characters with a single newline character.

The input string 'aaa\n\n\n\n' contains multiple consecutive newline characters. The `re.sub()` function is used to replace these newline characters with a single newline character.

The `re.sub()` function takes three arguments:
1. The pattern to search for. In this case, it's `re.compile(r'\n+')`, which matches one or more consecutive newline characters.
2. The string to replace the matched pattern with. In this case, it's `'\n'`, which is a single newline character.
3. The string to search in. In this case, it's `'aaa\n\n\n\n'`.

The `re.sub()` function returns the string with the matched pattern replaced by the replacement string. In this case, it returns 'aaa\n'.

<<<Output>>>
'aaa\n'
