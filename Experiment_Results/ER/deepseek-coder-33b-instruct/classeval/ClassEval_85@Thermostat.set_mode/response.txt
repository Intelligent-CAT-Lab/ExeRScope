<<<Analysis>>>
In the test() method, a Thermostat object t is created with initial current temperature 20, target temperature 25, and mode 'heat'.
Then, the mode of the thermostat is set to 'cool' using the set_mode() method.
Finally, the mode of the thermostat is returned using the get_mode() method.

The set_mode() method checks if the mode is either 'heat' or 'cool'. If it is, it sets the mode of the thermostat to the given mode. If it's not, it returns False.

In this case, the mode is set to 'cool', so the get_mode() method will return 'cool'.

<<<Output>>>
'cool'
