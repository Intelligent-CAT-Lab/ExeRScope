In the `Test.test()` method, an instance of `AccessGatewayFilter` is created and the `is_start_with()` method is invoked with a request URI of '/def/data'.

The `is_start_with()` method checks if the request URI starts with any of the strings in the `start_with` list. In this case, the `start_with` list contains '/api' and '/login'. Since '/def/data' does not start with either of these strings, the method returns False.

<<<Output>>>
False
