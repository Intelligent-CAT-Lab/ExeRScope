In the test() method, the NLPDataProcessor2 class is instantiated and the process_data() method is called with a list of strings as input.

The process_data() method processes each string in the input list. For each string, it first removes any non-English letters and converts the string to lowercase. This is done using the re.sub() function, which replaces all non-English letters with an empty string.

Next, the string is split into words using the split() function. The resulting list of words is then appended to the words_list.

After processing all strings, the words_list is returned.

In the test() method, the expected_output is also defined. This is a list of lists, where each inner list corresponds to the processed words from the corresponding string in the input list.

Finally, the return statement returns a tuple containing the output of the process_data() method and the expected_output.
