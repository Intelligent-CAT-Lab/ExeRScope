In the test() method, the SQLQueryBuilder.insert() method is invoked. The purpose of this method is to generate an SQL INSERT query.
The method takes two parameters: the name of the table and a dictionary of data to be inserted.
Inside the insert() method, the keys and values of the data dictionary are extracted and formatted into strings.
The keys are joined into a string with ', ' as the separator, and the values are also joined into a string with ', ' as the separator, but each value is also surrounded by single quotes.
The method then constructs and returns an SQL INSERT query string.
In this case, the table name is 'students', and the data dictionary is {'name': 'Tom', 'age': 18}.
So, the SQL INSERT query generated is:
"INSERT INTO students (name, age) VALUES ('Tom', '18')"
<<<Output>>>
"INSERT INTO students (name, age) VALUES ('Tom', '18')"
