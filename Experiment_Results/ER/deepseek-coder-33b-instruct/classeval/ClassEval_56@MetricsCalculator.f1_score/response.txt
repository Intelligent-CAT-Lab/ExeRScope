In the test() method, a MetricsCalculator object `mc` is created. Then, the `f1_score` method is called on `mc` with two lists as arguments. The first list is the predicted labels and the second list is the true labels.

The `f1_score` method first calls the `update` method on `mc` with the same two lists as arguments. The `update` method iterates over the two lists in parallel, comparing each pair of labels. If the predicted label is 1 and the true label is 1, it increments `true_positives`. If the predicted label is 1 and the true label is 0, it increments `false_positives`. If the predicted label is 0 and the true label is 1, it increments `false_negatives`. If the predicted label is 0 and the true label is 0, it increments `true_negatives`.

After the `update` method is done, the `f1_score` method calculates the precision and recall. Precision is the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false positives. Recall is the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false negatives.

The `f1_score` method then calculates the F1 score, which is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. If the sum of precision and recall is 0, it returns 0.0. Otherwise, it returns (2 * precision * recall) / (precision + recall).

In this case, the predicted labels are [1, 1, 0, 0] and the true labels are [1, 0, 0, 1]. After the `update` method is done, `true_positives` is 1, `false_positives` is 1, `false_negatives` is 1, and `true_negatives` is 1. The precision is 1 / (1 + 1) = 0.5, the recall is 1 / (1 + 1) = 0.5, and the F1 score is (2 * 0.5 * 0.5) / (0.5 + 0.5) = 0.5.
