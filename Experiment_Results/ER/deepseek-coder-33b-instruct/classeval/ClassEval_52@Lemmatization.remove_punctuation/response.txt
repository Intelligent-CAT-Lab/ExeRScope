<<<Analysis>>>
In the test() method, an instance of the Lemmatization class is created. The remove_punctuation() method is then called on the instance with the string "Is this a test? I hope it is..." as the argument.

The remove_punctuation() method works by using the translate() function, which replaces specified characters with None. In this case, it replaces all punctuation with None. The string.punctuation constant contains all punctuation characters.

So, the string "Is this a test? I hope it is..." is passed to the translate() function, which replaces all punctuation with None, resulting in the string "Is this a test I hope it is".

The expected output is also defined as "Is this a test I hope it is".

<<<Output>>>
('Is this a test I hope it is', 'Is this a test I hope it is')
