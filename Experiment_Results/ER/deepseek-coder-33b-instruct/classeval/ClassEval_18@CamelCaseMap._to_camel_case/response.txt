In the `test()` method, the `CamelCaseMap._to_camel_case('first_name')` method is invoked. The purpose of this method is to convert a string from snake case to camel case. In this case, the input string is 'first_name'.

The `_to_camel_case()` method splits the input string into parts based on the underscore character. The first part is kept as is, and the rest of the parts are converted to title case (i.e., the first letter of each word is capitalized).

The `split()` method is used to split the string into parts. In this case, it splits the string 'first_name' into ['first', 'name'].

The `join()` method is used to concatenate the parts back into a single string. The first part is kept as is, and the rest of the parts are concatenated with the title case version of the rest of the parts.

So, the output of the `CamelCaseMap._to_camel_case('first_name')` method is 'firstName'.

<<<Output>>>
'firstName'
