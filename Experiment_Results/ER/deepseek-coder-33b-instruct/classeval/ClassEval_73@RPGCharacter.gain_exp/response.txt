<<<Analysis>>>
In the test() method, an instance of the RPGCharacter class is created with the name "John", 100 hp, 20 attack power, and 10 defense. The level is not specified, so it defaults to 1.
The character gains 400 experience points by calling the gain_exp() method.
The gain_exp() method checks if the character's current experience plus the gained experience is greater than or equal to the character's current level multiplied by 100. If it is, the character levels up. The character's level, hp, attack power, and defense increase by 1, and the character's experience resets to 0.
In this case, the character gains 400 experience points, which is enough to level up twice. After the first level up, the character's level is 2, hp is 120, attack power is 25, and defense is 15. After the second level up, the character's level is 3, hp is 140, attack power is 30, and defense is 20.
The test() method returns the character's level and experience after gaining 400 experience points.
