In the test() method, a ComplexCalculator object is created and the subtract() method is invoked with two complex numbers as arguments. The purpose of this method is to subtract two complex numbers.
The subtract() method takes two complex numbers c1 and c2 as input. It calculates the real and imaginary parts of the result by subtracting the real parts of c1 and c2, and the imaginary parts of c1 and c2, respectively.
In this case, c1 = (1 + 2j) and c2 = (3 + 4j).
The real part of the result is calculated as (1 - 3) = -2.
The imaginary part of the result is calculated as (2 - 4) = -2.
So, the result of the subtraction is (-2 - 2j).
<<<Output>>>
(-2-2j)
