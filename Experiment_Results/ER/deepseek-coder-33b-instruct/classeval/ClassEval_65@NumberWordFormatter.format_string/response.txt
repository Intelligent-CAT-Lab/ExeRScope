In the `Test.test()` method, an instance of `NumberWordFormatter` is created and the `format_string` method is called with the argument '123456'.

The `format_string` method takes a string as input and formats it into words. It first splits the string into two parts: the integer part and the decimal part. If the decimal part is not empty, it is ignored in this case.

The integer part is then reversed and padded with zeros at the end to make its length a multiple of 3. This is done to easily process the number in groups of 3 digits.

For each group of 3 digits, the `trans_three` method is called to convert the digits into words. If the first digit is not zero, it is converted into a word and "HUNDRED" is appended. If the last two digits are not zero, they are converted into words using the `trans_two` method.

The `trans_two` method converts a 2-digit number into words. If the first digit is zero, it is converted into a word. If the first digit is 1, it is converted into a word from the `NUMBER_TEEN` list. If the last digit is zero, it is ignored. Otherwise, it is converted into a word from the `NUMBER_TEN` list.

The `parse_more` method is not used in this case because the `NUMBER_MORE` list is empty.

Finally, the words for each group of 3 digits are combined into a single string, with "AND" between each group.
