<<<Analysis>>>
In the `test()` method, a customer dictionary is created with a name and fidelity points. A cart is also created with 5 items, each with a product name, quantity, and price. The `DiscountStrategy` class is then instantiated with the customer, cart, and `LargeOrderPromo` as the promotion.

The `LargeOrderPromo` method is a static method that calculates a discount based on the number of unique products in the cart. If there are 10 or more unique products, a 7% discount is applied.

In the `test()` method, the expected discount is set to 0, as the cart only contains 5 unique products. The actual discount is calculated by calling the promotion method on the order object.

The `promotion` method is called with `order` as the argument. This calls the `LargeOrderPromo` method with `order` as the argument.

The `LargeOrderPromo` method checks if the number of unique products in the cart is 10 or more. In this case, it returns 0, as there are only 5 unique products.

So, the actual discount is 0, and the expected discount is also 0.

<<<Output>>>
(0, 0)
