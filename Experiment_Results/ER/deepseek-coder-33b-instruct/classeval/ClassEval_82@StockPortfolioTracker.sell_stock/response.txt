<<<Analysis>>>
In the `test()` method, an instance of `StockPortfolioTracker` is created with an initial cash balance of 10000.0. The portfolio is then set to contain one stock, 'AAPL', with a price of 150.0 and a quantity of 20.

The `sell_stock()` method is then called with the same stock. This method checks if the stock is in the portfolio and if the quantity to be sold is less than or equal to the quantity in the portfolio. If both conditions are met, it removes the stock from the portfolio and adds the value of the sold stock to the cash balance. In this case, the stock is in the portfolio and the quantity to be sold is equal to the quantity in the portfolio, so the stock is removed from the portfolio and the cash balance is increased by the value of the sold stock.

The method returns `True` to indicate that the stock was successfully sold. The portfolio after the sale is an empty list, and the cash balance is increased by the value of the sold stock.

<<<Output>>>
(True, [], 20000.0)
