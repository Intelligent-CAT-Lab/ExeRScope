<<<Analysis>>>
In the `Test.test()` method, an instance of the `RegexUtils` class is created and stored in the variable `ru`.
The `generate_phone_number_pattern()` method is then called on `ru` to generate a regular expression pattern for matching phone numbers. This pattern is stored in the variable `pat`.
The `match()` method is then called on `ru`, passing `pat` and the string '123-456-789' as arguments. This method checks if the string '123-456-789' matches the pattern stored in `pat`.
The pattern `pat` is a regular expression that matches strings in the format '123-456-789', where '123', '456', and '789' are any three-digit numbers. The string '123-456-789' matches this pattern, so the `match()` method returns `True`.
<<<Output>>>
