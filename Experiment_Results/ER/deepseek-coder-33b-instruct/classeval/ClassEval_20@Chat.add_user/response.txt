<<<Analysis>>>
In the test() method, a new Chat object is created and a user 'John' is added to the users dictionary.
Then, the add_user() method is called with 'Mary' as the argument. This method checks if 'Mary' is already in the users dictionary. Since it's not, it adds 'Mary' to the dictionary and returns True.
The users dictionary after the add_user() method is called is {'John': [], 'Mary': []}.
<<<Output>>>
(True, {'John': [], 'Mary': []})
