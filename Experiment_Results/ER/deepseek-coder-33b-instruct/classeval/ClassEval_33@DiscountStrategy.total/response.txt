<<<Analysis>>>
In the `test()` method, a customer dictionary and a cart list are defined. The customer has a fidelity of 1200. The cart contains two items, each with a quantity and price.

The `DiscountStrategy` class is then instantiated with the customer and cart. The `total()` method is called on the instance, which calculates the total cost of the items in the cart.

The `total()` method iterates over each item in the cart, multiplies the quantity by the price, and adds this to a running total. In this case, the total is 150.0.

The `due()` method is then called on the instance, which calculates the amount due after applying any discounts. Since no promotion is specified, the discount is 0, so the due amount is also 150.0.

Finally, the `test()` method returns a tuple containing the actual total and the expected total.

<<<Output>>>
(150.0, 150.0)
