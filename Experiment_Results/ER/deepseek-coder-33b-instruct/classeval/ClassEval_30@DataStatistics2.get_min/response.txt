<<<Analysis>>>
In the test() method, a DataStatistics2 object is created with the data [-111, -1, -3, 2].
The get_min() method is then called on this object.
The get_min() method is a part of the DataStatistics2 class. It uses the numpy library's np.min() function to find the minimum value in the data array.
In this case, the data array is [-111, -1, -3, 2]. The minimum value in this array is -111.
So, the return value of ds2.get_min() is -111.

<<<Output>>>
-111
