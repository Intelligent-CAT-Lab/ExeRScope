<<<Analysis>>>
In the test() method, an instance of the HRManagementSystem class is created and an employee is added to the system. The employee's ID is 1, name is 'John', position is 'Manager', department is 'Sales', and salary is 100000.

Then, the get_employee() method is called with the employee ID 2. This method checks if the employee ID is in the system. Since the employee ID 2 is not in the system, the method returns False.

<<<Output>>>
False
