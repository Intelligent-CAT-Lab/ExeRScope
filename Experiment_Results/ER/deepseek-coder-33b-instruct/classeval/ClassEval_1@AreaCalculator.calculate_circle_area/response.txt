In the test() method, an instance of the AreaCalculator class is created with a radius of 2000.
The calculate_circle_area() method is then called on this instance.
The purpose of this method is to calculate the area of a circle given the radius.
In this case, the radius is 2000.
The formula for the area of a circle is pi * radius^2.
So, the area of the circle is calculated as 3141592.653589793 * 2000^2 = 12566370.614359172.
<<<Output>>>
12566370.614359172
