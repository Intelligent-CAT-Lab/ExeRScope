In the test() method, an instance of URLHandler is created with a URL string as an argument. The URL string is "https://www.bing.com/search?pglt=41&q=humaneval&cvid=4dc2da2bb4bc429eb498c85245ae5253&aqs=edge.0.0l7j69i61j69i60.10008j0j1&FORM=ANNTA1&PC=U531&mkt=zh-CN".
The get_scheme() method is then called on this instance.

The get_scheme() method works by finding the index of "://" in the URL string. If "://" is found, it returns the substring from the start of the URL to the index of "://". If "://" is not found, it returns None.

In this case, "://" is found at index 5 in the URL string. Therefore, the get_scheme() method returns the substring from the start of the URL to index 5, which is "https".

So, the return value of Test.test() is "https".

<<<Output>>>
"https"
