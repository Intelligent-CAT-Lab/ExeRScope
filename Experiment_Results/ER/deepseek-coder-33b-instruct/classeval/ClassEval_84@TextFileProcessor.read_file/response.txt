In the `test()` method of the `Test` class, the following steps are performed:

1. A list of file names is created.
2. A list of file contents is created.
3. A loop is run over the list of file names. For each file name, a file is created with the corresponding content.
4. An instance of `TextFileProcessor` is created with the first file name.
5. The `read_file()` method of the `TextFileProcessor` instance is called to read the content of the first file.
6. The return value of the `test()` method is a tuple containing the type of the data read from the file, the data itself, and the expected content of the first file.
