In the `Test.test()` method, the `VectorUtil.compute_idf_weight_dict()` method is invoked with `2` and `{'key1': 0.2, 'key2': 0.5}` as arguments.

The `compute_idf_weight_dict()` method calculates the Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) weight for each key in the dictionary. IDF is a measure of how much information the word provides, that is, it is a logarithmically scaled frequency of the word across all documents.

Here's the step-by-step analysis of the code:

1. The method receives `total_num` (which is `2` in this case) and `number_dict` (which is `{'key1': 0.2, 'key2': 0.5}`).
2. It initializes an empty dictionary `index_2_key_map` and an empty list `count_list`.
3. It iterates over each key-value pair in `number_dict`. For each pair, it adds the key to `index_2_key_map` with the current index, and the value to `count_list`.
4. It converts `count_list` to a numpy array `a`.
5. It calculates the IDF for each count in `a` using the formula `np.log((total_num + 1) / (a + 1))`.
6. It initializes an empty dictionary `result`.
7. It iterates over each index and weight in `a`. For each pair, it retrieves the key from `index_2_key_map` using the index, and adds the key-weight pair to `result`.
8. Finally, it returns `result`.

The output of the code is the IDF weights for each key in `number_dict`.
