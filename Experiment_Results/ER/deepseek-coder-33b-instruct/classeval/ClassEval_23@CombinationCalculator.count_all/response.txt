In the test() method, the CombinationCalculator.count_all(0) method is invoked. The purpose of this method is to calculate the total number of combinations for a given number n. In this case, n = 0.
The count_all() method checks if n is less than 0 or greater than 63. If n is less than 0 or greater than 63, it returns False.
Since n = 0, the condition n < 0 or n > 63 is not met, so it proceeds to the next line.
The method returns (1 << n) - 1 if n != 63 else float("inf"). Here, 1 is shifted left by n places, which is equivalent to 2^n. Subtracting 1 from this gives us the total number of combinations for n elements.
Since n = 0, 1 << 0 is 1, and 1 - 1 is 0.
So, the return value of CombinationCalculator.count_all(0) is 0.
