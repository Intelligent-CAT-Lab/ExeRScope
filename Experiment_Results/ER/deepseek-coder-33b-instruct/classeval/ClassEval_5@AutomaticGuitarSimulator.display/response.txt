In the `test()` method, an instance of `AutomaticGuitarSimulator` is created with an empty string as the input. The `display()` method is then called with empty strings as the key and value.

The `display()` method takes two parameters, `key` and `value`. It returns a formatted string with the key and value. The format string is "Normal Guitar Playing -- Chord: %s, Play Tune: %s". The `%s` is a placeholder for a string, and `%s` and `%s` are replaced by `key` and `value` respectively.

In this case, `key` and `value` are both empty strings, so the returned string is "Normal Guitar Playing -- Chord: , Play Tune: ".
