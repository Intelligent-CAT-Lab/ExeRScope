In the `test()` method, a new instance of `CamelCaseMap` is created and assigned to the variable `camelize_map`.

Then, the `__setitem__` method is called on `camelize_map` with the arguments `'age'` and `30`. This method calls `_convert_key` on `'age'`, which returns `'age'`. Then it sets the value `30` in the `_data` dictionary of `camelize_map` with the key `'age'`.

Finally, the `__getitem__` method is called on `camelize_map` with the argument `'age'`. This method calls `_convert_key` on `'age'`, which returns `'age'`. Then it retrieves the value from the `_data` dictionary of `camelize_map` with the key `'age'`, which is `30`.

So, the return value of `Test.test()` is `30`.

<<<Output>>>
