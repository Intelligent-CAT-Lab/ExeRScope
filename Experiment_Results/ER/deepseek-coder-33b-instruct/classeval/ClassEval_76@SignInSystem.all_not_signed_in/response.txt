<<<Analysis>>>
In the test() method, a new SignInSystem object is created and assigned to the variable signin_system.
Then, the add_user() method is called with the argument "aaa". This adds a new user with the username "aaa" to the system.
Next, the sign_in() method is called with the argument "aaa". This signs in the user with the username "aaa".
Finally, the all_not_signed_in() method is called. This method checks all users in the system and returns a list of usernames of users who are not signed in.
In this case, since only one user "aaa" is added and signed in, the all_not_signed_in() method will return an empty list.
