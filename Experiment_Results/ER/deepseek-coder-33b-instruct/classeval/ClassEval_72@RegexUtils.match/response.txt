<<<Analysis>>>
In the test() method, an instance of the RegexUtils class is created and stored in the variable `ru`.
The `match()` method of the `ru` object is then called with two arguments: a regular expression pattern and a text string.
The pattern `r'\b\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}\b'` is a regular expression that matches a phone number in the format of XXX-XXX-XXXX, where X is a digit.
The text string "1234567890" is not a valid phone number in this format, so the `match()` method should return `False`.
<<<Output>>>
False
