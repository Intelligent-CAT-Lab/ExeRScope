In the `test()` method, an instance of the `TriCalculator` class is created and the `taylor()` method is invoked with the arguments 90 and 50. The `taylor()` method calculates the Taylor series approximation of the cosine function.

The `taylor()` method takes two arguments: `x` and `n`. `x` is the value for which the cosine is to be approximated, and `n` is the number of terms in the Taylor series to be used.

In the `taylor()` method, `x` is converted from degrees to radians by multiplying by `pi/180`. Then, a variable `a` is initialized to 1, which will hold the sum of the Taylor series.

A for loop is used to calculate the sum of the Taylor series. For each iteration of the loop, `k` is the current term in the series. If `k` is odd, `a` is subtracted from the term, and if `k` is even, `a` is added to the term.

The term in the series is calculated as `(x ** (2 * k)) / self.factorial(2 * k)`. The factorial of `2 * k` is calculated by the `factorial()` method, which multiplies all integers from `2 * k` down to 1.

After the loop completes, `a` is returned, which is the approximation of the cosine of `x`.

In this case, `x` is 90 degrees, which is equivalent to `pi/2` radians. `n` is 50.

The `taylor()` method returns the approximation of the cosine of `x`, which is approximately 0.0.
