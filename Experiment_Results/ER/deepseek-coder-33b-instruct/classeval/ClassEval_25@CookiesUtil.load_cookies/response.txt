<<<Analysis>>>
In the test() method, an instance of the CookiesUtil class is created with the filename 'cookies.json' as the argument.
The cookies attribute of the CookiesUtil instance is then set to a dictionary containing two cookies.
The load_cookies() method is then called on the CookiesUtil instance.

The load_cookies() method tries to open the file specified by the cookies_file attribute of the CookiesUtil instance. If the file is found, it reads the JSON data from the file and returns it. If the file is not found, it catches the FileNotFoundError exception and returns an empty dictionary.

In this case, since the file 'cookies.json' does not exist, the FileNotFoundError exception is caught and an empty dictionary is returned.
