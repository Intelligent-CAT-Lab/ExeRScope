<<<Analysis>>>
In the test() method, a BinaryDataProcessor object is created with a binary string "01101000011011010110001001101111".
The binary string is passed to the BinaryDataProcessor constructor, which initializes the binary_string attribute and calls the clean_non_binary_chars() method.
The clean_non_binary_chars() method removes any non-binary characters from the binary string. In this case, it doesn't remove any characters because all characters are binary.
The convert_to_ascii() method is then called on the BinaryDataProcessor object. This method converts the binary string to ASCII.
The binary string is split into bytes (8 bits each), and each byte is converted to a decimal number. These decimal numbers are then appended to a bytearray.
The bytearray is then decoded to ASCII using the decode() method.
The ASCII string is then returned by the convert_to_ascii() method.
<<<Output>>>
'hello'
