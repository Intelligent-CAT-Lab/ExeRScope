In the `Test.test()` method, an instance of the `TriCalculator` class is created and the `cos(0)` method is invoked on it. The `cos(0)` method calculates the cosine of a given angle using the Taylor series approximation. The Taylor series approximation is calculated in the `taylor(x, n)` method, which is called by the `cos(x)` method.

The `taylor(x, n)` method first converts the input angle from degrees to radians. Then it calculates the Taylor series approximation by summing up the terms of the series up to the nth term. The terms of the series are calculated using the `factorial(a)` method, which calculates the factorial of a given number.

The `factorial(a)` method calculates the factorial of a given number by multiplying the number by all the numbers below it.

The `taylor(x, n)` method returns the Taylor series approximation. The `cos(x)` method then returns the rounded value of this approximation to 10 decimal places.

The `Test.test()` method then returns the result of the `cos(0)` method, which is the cosine of 0 degrees.
