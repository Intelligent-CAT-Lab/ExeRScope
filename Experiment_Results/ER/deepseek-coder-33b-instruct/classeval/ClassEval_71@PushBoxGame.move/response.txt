<<<Analysis>>>
In the `test()` method, a new PushBoxGame instance is created with a game map. The game map is a 2D list where each character represents a different element:
- "#" represents a wall
- "O" represents the player
- "X" represents a box
- "G" represents a target
- " " (space) represents an empty space

The `move()` method is then called with the direction 's' (down). This method moves the player in the specified direction if the new position is not a wall. If the new position is a box, it also moves the box in the same direction if the new box position is not a wall.

The `check_win()` method is called after the move to check if all boxes are on targets. If all boxes are on targets, `is_game_over` is set to True.

The `test()` method returns a tuple containing the player's current column and row, and whether the game is over.
