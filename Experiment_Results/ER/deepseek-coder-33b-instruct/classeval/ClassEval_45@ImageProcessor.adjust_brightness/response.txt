In the `test()` method, the following steps are performed:
1. An instance of `ImageProcessor` is created and assigned to `self.processor`.
2. The path to a test image file is created and assigned to `self.image_path`.
3. A new white image of size 100x100 is created and saved to `self.image_path`.
4. The `load_image()` method of `self.processor` is called with `self.image_path` as the argument, loading the test image into `self.processor.image`.
5. An `ImageEnhance.Brightness` object is created with the test image and a brightness factor of 0.5. This is the expected image after adjusting the brightness.
6. The `adjust_brightness()` method of `self.processor` is called with a factor of 0.5, adjusting the brightness of `self.processor.image`.
7. The `ImageChops.difference()` function is used to calculate the difference between the expected image and the adjusted image. If the images are identical, this difference image will be all black (i.e., it will have a bounding box of `None`). The `getbbox()` method is then used to get the bounding box of this difference image. If this bounding box is `None`, it means the images are identical, so `True` is returned. Otherwise, `False` is returned.
