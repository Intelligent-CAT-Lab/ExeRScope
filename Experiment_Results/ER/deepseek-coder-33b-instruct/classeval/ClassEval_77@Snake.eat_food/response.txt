In the test() method, a Snake object is created with SCREEN_WIDTH=100, SCREEN_HEIGHT=100, BLOCK_SIZE=1, and food_position=(51, 51).
The snake.eat_food() method is called four times, which increases the length and score of the snake by 1 and 100 respectively each time.
The return statement returns the length and score of the snake after four calls to snake.eat_food().
