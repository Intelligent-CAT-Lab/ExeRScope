In the test() method, a MetricsCalculator object mc is created. The update() method of the MetricsCalculator class is called with two lists as arguments. The first list contains the predicted labels and the second list contains the true labels.

The update() method iterates over the two lists simultaneously using the zip() function. For each pair of predicted and true labels, it increments the appropriate counter variable.

In this case, the predicted labels are [1, 1, 0, 1] and the true labels are [1, 0, 0, 1].

The update() method will increment the true_positives counter by 1 (for the first pair of labels), increment the true_negatives counter by 1 (for the last pair of labels), and increment the false_positives counter by 1 (for the second pair of labels).

After the update() method is called, the accuracy() method is called with the same two lists as arguments. The accuracy() method calculates the accuracy of the predictions by dividing the sum of true_positives and true_negatives by the total number of predictions.

In this case, the total number of predictions is 4 (since there are 4 pairs of labels), and the sum of true_positives and true_negatives is 2 (since there is 1 true positive and 1 true negative).

So, the accuracy is 2 / 4 = 0.5.

<<<Output>>>
0.5
