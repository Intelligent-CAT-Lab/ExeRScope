In the `Test.test()` method, two lists of vectors are defined: `vector_list1` and `vector_list2`. These lists are then passed to the `VectorUtil.n_similarity()` method.

The `VectorUtil.n_similarity()` method calculates the cosine similarity between the mean of two lists of vectors. The mean of a list of vectors is calculated by taking the element-wise mean of the vectors.

In the `Test.test()` method, `vector_list1` is `[np.array([1, 1]), np.array([0, 1])]` and `vector_list2` is `[np.array([0, 0]), np.array([1, 1])]`.

The mean of `vector_list1` is `[0.5, 1]` and the mean of `vector_list2` is `[0.5, 0.5]`.

The `VectorUtil.n_similarity()` method then calculates the cosine similarity between these two means. This is done by first normalizing the vectors to unit vectors using the `matutils.unitvec()` function, and then calculating the dot product of the two unit vectors.

The dot product of `[0.5, 1]` and `[0.5, 0.5]` is `0.5*0.5 + 1*0.5 = 0.75`.

Therefore, the return value of `Test.test()` is `0.75`.
