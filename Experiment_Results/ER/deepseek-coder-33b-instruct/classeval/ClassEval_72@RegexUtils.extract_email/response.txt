<<<Analysis>>>
In the `Test.test()` method, an instance of the `RegexUtils` class is created and stored in the variable `ru`. Then, the `extract_email` method of the `RegexUtils` class is called with the string "abcdefg@.com ygusyfysy@126.com wljduyuv@qq.com" as the argument.

The `extract_email` method uses the `findall` method of the `re` module to find all substrings where the regular expression matches, and returns them as a list. The regular expression used in this method is generated by the `generate_email_pattern` method.

The `generate_email_pattern` method returns a regular expression pattern that matches email addresses. The pattern `r'\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\b'` matches any string that starts and ends with a word boundary (`\b`), contains one or more alphanumeric characters, dots, underscores, percent signs, plus signs, or hyphens (`[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+`), followed by an at sign (`@`), followed by one or more alphanumeric characters, dots, or hyphens (`[A-Za-z0-9.-]+`), followed by a dot (`\.`), and ends with two or more alphabetic characters (`[A-Z|a-z]{2,}`).

So, the `extract_email` method will return a list of all email addresses in the input string that match this pattern.

<<<Output>>>
['abcdefg@.com', 'ygusyfysy@126.com', 'wljduyuv@qq.com']
