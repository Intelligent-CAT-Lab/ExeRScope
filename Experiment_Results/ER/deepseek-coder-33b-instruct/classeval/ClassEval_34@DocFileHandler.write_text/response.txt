<<<Analysis>>>
In the `Test.test()` method, the following steps are performed:

1. The file path is set to "test_example.docx".
2. An instance of `DocFileHandler` is created with the file path.
3. A new document is created and saved with the initial content "Initial content".
4. The `write_text()` method is called with the new content "New content 1". This method writes the new content to the document and saves it.
5. The `read_text()` method is called to read the content of the document.
6. The method returns a tuple containing the text content of the document and the new content.

<<<Output>>>
("New content 1", "New content 1")
