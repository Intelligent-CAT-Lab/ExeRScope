In the `test()` method, an instance of `CamelCaseMap` is created and stored in the variable `camelize_map`. Then, the `_convert_key()` method is invoked on `camelize_map` with the argument `'first_name'`.

The `_convert_key()` method checks if the input key is a string. If it is, it converts the string to camel case format using the `_to_camel_case()` method. If the input key is not a string, it simply returns the key.

In the `_to_camel_case()` method, the input string is split into parts based on the underscore character. The first part is kept as is, and the rest of the parts are converted to title case (i.e., the first character of each word is capitalized). The parts are then joined together to form the final camel case string.

So, when `_convert_key('first_name')` is called, it splits the string 'first_name' into ['first', 'name'], capitalizes the second part to 'Name', and joins them together to form 'firstName'.

Therefore, the return value of `Test.test()` is 'firstName'.

<<<Output>>>
'firstName'
