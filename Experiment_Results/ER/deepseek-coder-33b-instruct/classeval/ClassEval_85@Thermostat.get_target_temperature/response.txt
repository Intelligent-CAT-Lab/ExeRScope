<<<Analysis>>>
In the test() method, a Thermostat object t is created with current_temperature=25, target_temperature=25, and mode='cool'.
The get_target_temperature() method is then called on this object, which returns the target_temperature attribute of the object.
In the Thermostat class, the get_target_temperature() method simply returns the value of the target_temperature attribute.
<<<Output>>>
25
