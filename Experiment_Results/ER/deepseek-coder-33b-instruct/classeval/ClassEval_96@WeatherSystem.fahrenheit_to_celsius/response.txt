In the test() method, a WeatherSystem object is created with the city 'New York'. The temperature of the city is set to 73 degrees Celsius. Then, the fahrenheit_to_celsius() method is called on the weatherSystem object.

The fahrenheit_to_celsius() method converts the temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius. The formula used is (Fahrenheit - 32) * 5/9.

So, the temperature in Fahrenheit is 73 * 9/5 + 32 = 163.4 F.

<<<Output>>>
163.4
