In the `test()` method, the `MetricsCalculator2.map()` method is invoked with a list of tuples as input. Each tuple contains a list of binary values and an integer. The purpose of the `map()` method is to calculate the Mean Average Precision (MAP) and the Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) for each tuple.

The `map()` method first checks if the input is a list or a tuple. If it's not, it raises an exception.

If the input is an empty list, it returns 0.0 for both MAP and MRR.

If the input is a tuple, it calculates the MAP and MRR for that tuple. It first checks if the total number is 0. If it is, it returns 0.0 for both MAP and MRR. If it's not, it calculates the ranking array, which is an array of reciprocal values from 1 to the length of the sub-list. It then calculates the MAP and MRR for the sub-list.

If the input is a list of tuples, it calculates the MAP and MRR for each tuple in the list. It does the same checks as before, and then calculates the MAP and MRR for each sub-list. It stores the results in a list, and then returns the mean of the results and the list of results.

In the `test()` method, the input is a list of tuples. The first tuple contains the list [1, 0, 1, 1] and the integer 4. The second tuple contains the list [0, 1, 0, 0] and the integer 4.

The MAP for the first tuple is calculated as follows:
- The ranking array is [1.0, 0.5, 0.33, 0.25]
- The right ranking list is [1, 0, 2, 3]
- The MAP is the sum of the product of the right ranking list and the ranking array divided by the total number, which is 1.0 * 1.0 + 0.0 * 0.5 + 2.0 * 0.33 + 3.0 * 0.25 / 4 = 1.33

The MAP for the second tuple is calculated in the same way, but the right ranking list is [0, 1, 0, 0], so the MAP is 0.0

The mean of the MAPs is (1.33 + 0.0) / 2 = 0.665

The MRR for the first tuple is 0.0, because the first element of the sub-list is 0.

The MRR for the second tuple is 0.0, because the first element of the sub-list is 0.

The mean of the MRRs is (0.0 + 0.0) / 2 = 0.0

<<<Output>>>
(0.665, [1.33, 0.0])
