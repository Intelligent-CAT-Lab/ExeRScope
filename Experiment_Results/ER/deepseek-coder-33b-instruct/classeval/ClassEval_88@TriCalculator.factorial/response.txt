In the test() method, an instance of the TriCalculator class is created and the factorial() method is invoked on it with the argument 2. The purpose of this method is to calculate the factorial of a given number. In this case, the number is 2.

The factorial() method works by initializing a variable b to 1 and then entering a while loop that continues until a is not equal to 1. In each iteration of the loop, b is multiplied by a and a is decremented by 1.

The loop will run twice:

First iteration: a=2, b=1, b = b * a = 1 * 2 = 2, a = a - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1
Second iteration: a=1, b=2, b = b * a = 2 * 1 = 2, a = a - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0 (loop ends)

After the loop, the method returns b, which is 2.

<<<Output>>>
2
