<<<Analysis>>>
In the test() method, a CurrencyConverter object is created and the convert() method is invoked with the parameters 64, '???', 'USD'.
The convert() method takes three parameters: amount, from_currency, and to_currency.
The method first checks if from_currency and to_currency are the same. If they are, it returns the amount.
Then it checks if either from_currency or to_currency is not in the rates dictionary. If either is not in the dictionary, it returns False.
If both from_currency and to_currency are in the dictionary, it retrieves the rates for both currencies and calculates the converted amount.
The conversion is done by dividing the amount by the from_rate and then multiplying by the to_rate.
The '???' in the parameters is a placeholder for the from_currency. The actual from_currency is not provided, so the method will return False.

<<<Output>>>
False
