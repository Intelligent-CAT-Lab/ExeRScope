<<<Analysis>>>
In the `test()` method, we are initializing a `ClassRegistrationSystem` object and assigning it to `self.registration_system`. Then we are adding some students to the system.

The `get_students_by_major()` method is called twice, once for "Computer Science" and once for "Mathematics".

In the `get_students_by_major()` method, we are iterating over all the students in the system. If the major of a student matches the input major, we add the student's name to the `student_list`.

For "Computer Science", the method will add "John" and "Bob" to `student_list`.
For "Mathematics", the method will add "Alice", "Tom", and "Jerry" to `student_list`.

Finally, the method returns `student_list`, which contains the names of all students in the specified major.

So, the return value of `Test.test()` will be a tuple containing two lists: the first list contains the names of all students in the "Computer Science" major, and the second list contains the names of all students in the "Mathematics" major.

<<<Output>>>
(['John', 'Bob'], ['Alice', 'Tom', 'Jerry'])
