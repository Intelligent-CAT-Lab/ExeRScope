The function f takes two parameters: a text string and a search string. It initializes an empty list indexes. Then it enters a while loop that continues as long as the search string is found in the text.

In each iteration of the loop, it finds the rightmost index of the search string in the text, appends this index to the list indexes, and then removes the part of the text from the rightmost index to the end.

When the loop finishes, it returns the list indexes.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'ONBPICJOHRHDJOSNCPNJ9ONTHBQCJ' and 'J', we need to follow the steps of the function.

1. The search string 'J' is found at index 15 in the text. So, 15 is appended to the list indexes and the text is updated to 'ONBPICJOHRHDJOSNCPNJ9ONTHBQC'.
2. The search string 'J' is found at index 14 in the updated text. So, 14 is appended to the list indexes and the text is updated to 'ONBPICJOHRHDJOSNCPNJ9ONTHBQC'.
3. The search string 'J' is found at index 13 in the updated text. So, 13 is appended to the list indexes and the text is updated to 'ONBPICJOHRHDJOSNCPNJ9ONTHBQC'.
4. The search string 'J' is found at index 12 in the updated text. So, 12 is appended to the list indexes and the text is updated to 'ONBPICJOHRHDJOSNCPNJ9ONTHBQC'.
5. The search string 'J' is found at index 11 in the updated text. So, 11 is appended to the list indexes and the text is updated to 'ONBPICJOHRHDJOSNCPNJ9ONTHBQC'.
6. The search string 'J' is found at index 10 in the updated text. So, 10 is appended to the list indexes and the text is updated to 'ONBPICJOHRHDJOSNCPNJ9ONTHBQC'.
7. The search string 'J' is found at index 9 in the updated text. So, 9 is appended to the list indexes and the text is updated to 'ONBPICJOHRHDJOSNCPNJ9ONTHBQC'.
8. The search string 'J' is found at index 8 in the updated text. So, 8 is appended to the list indexes and the text is updated to 'ONBPICJOHRHDJOSNCPNJ9ONTHBQC'.
9. The search string 'J' is found at index 7 in the updated text. So, 7 is appended to the list indexes and the text is updated to 'ONBPICJOHRHDJOSNCPNJ9ONTHBQC'.
10. The search string 'J' is found at index 6 in the updated text. So, 6 is appended to the list indexes and the text is updated to 'ONBPICJOHRHDJOSNCPNJ9ONTHBQC'.
11. The search string 'J' is found at index 5 in the updated text. So, 5 is appended to the list indexes and the text is updated to 'ONBPICJOHRHDJOSNCPNJ9ONTHBQC'.
12. The search string 'J' is found at index 4 in the updated text. So, 4 is appended to the list indexes and the text is updated to 'ONBPICJOHRHDJOSNCPNJ9ONTHBQC'.
13. The search string 'J' is found at index 3 in the updated text. So, 3 is appended to the list indexes and the text is updated to 'ONBPICJOHRHDJOSNCPNJ9ONTHBQC'.
14. The search string 'J' is found at index 2 in the updated text. So, 2 is appended to the list indexes and the text is updated to 'ONBPICJOHRHDJOSNCPNJ9ONTHBQC'.
15. The search string 'J' is found at index 1 in the updated text. So, 1 is appended to the list indexes and the text is updated to 'ONBPICJOHRHDJOSNCPNJ9ONTH
