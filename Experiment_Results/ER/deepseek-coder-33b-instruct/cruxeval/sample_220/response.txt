The function f takes a string text, an integer m, and an integer n as input. It first creates a new string by concatenating text, the first m characters of text, and the characters of text from the nth character onwards. Then it creates an empty string result. It then iterates over the characters of the new string from the nth character to the end of the string minus m. For each character, it prepends the character to the result string. Finally, it returns the result string.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "abcdefgabc", 1, 2, we need to follow the steps of the function.

1. The new string becomes "abcabca".
2. The result string becomes "cba".

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "abcdefgabc", 1, 2 is "cba".

<<<Output>>>
'cba'
