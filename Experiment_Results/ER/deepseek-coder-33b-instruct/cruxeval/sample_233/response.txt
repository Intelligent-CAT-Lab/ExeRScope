The function f takes a list xs as input. It iterates over the indices of the list in reverse order. For each index, it removes the first element of the list and inserts it at the current index. This effectively rotates the list to the right.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 2, 3], we need to follow the steps of the function.

1. The list initially is [1, 2, 3].
2. The range of indices is from -4 to -1 (exclusive).
3. For idx = -4, the first element of the list is 1, which is removed and inserted at index -4. The list becomes [2, 3, 1].
4. For idx = -3, the first element of the list is 2, which is removed and inserted at index -3. The list becomes [3, 2, 1].
5. For idx = -2, the first element of the list is 3, which is removed and inserted at index -2. The list becomes [2, 3, 1].
6. For idx = -1, the first element of the list is 2, which is removed and inserted at index -1. The list becomes [3, 1, 2].

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 2, 3] is [3, 1, 2].

<<<Output>>>
[3, 1, 2]
