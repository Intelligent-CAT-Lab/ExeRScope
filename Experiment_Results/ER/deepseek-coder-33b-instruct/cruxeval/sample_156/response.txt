The function f takes three parameters: a string text, an integer limit, and a character char. If the limit is less than the length of the text, it returns the first limit characters of the text. Otherwise, it pads the text with the character char on the right until it reaches the length of limit.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'tqzym', 5, 'c', we first check if 5 is less than the length of 'tqzym', which is 5. Since 5 is not less than 5, we do not return the first 5 characters of 'tqzym'. Instead, we pad 'tqzym' with 'c' on the right until it reaches the length of 5. The resulting string is 'tqzym'.

<<<Output>>>
'tqzym'
