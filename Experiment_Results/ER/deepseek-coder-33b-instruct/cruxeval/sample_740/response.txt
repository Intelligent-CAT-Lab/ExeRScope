The function f takes a list plot and a delin as input. It checks if delin is in plot. If it is, it finds the index of delin in plot, splits plot into two parts at the index of delin, and returns the concatenation of the first part and the second part. If delin is not in plot, it returns plot as it is.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 2, 3, 4] and 3, we need to check if 3 is in [1, 2, 3, 4]. It is, so we split the list at the index of 3, which is 2. The first part is [1, 2] and the second part is [4]. The concatenation of the first part and the second part is [1, 2, 4].

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 2, 3, 4] and 3 is [1, 2, 4].

<<<Output>>>
[1, 2, 4]
