The function f takes a list lst as input. It initializes a variable i to 0 and an empty list new_list. It then enters a while loop that continues until i is no longer less than the length of lst.

Inside the loop, it checks if the i-th element of lst is in the sublist of lst from the (i+1)-th element to the end. If it is, it appends this element to new_list. If the length of new_list is 3, it returns new_list.

After the loop, it returns new_list.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [0, 2, 1, 2, 6, 2, 6, 3, 0], we need to follow the steps of the function.

1. i is 0, lst[0] is 0, 0 is not in lst[1:] (which is [2, 1, 2, 6, 2, 6, 3, 0]), so new_list remains empty.
2. i is 1, lst[1] is 2, 2 is in lst[2:] (which is [1, 2, 6, 2, 6, 3, 0]), so 2 is appended to new_list.
3. i is 2, lst[2] is 1, 1 is not in lst[3:] (which is [2, 6, 2, 6, 3, 0]), so new_list remains [2].
4. i is 3, lst[3] is 2, 2 is in lst[4:] (which is [6, 2, 6, 3, 0]), so 2 is appended to new_list.
5. i is 4, lst[4] is 6, 6 is in lst[5:] (which is [2, 6, 3, 0]), so 6 is appended to new_list.
6. i is 5, lst[5] is 2, 2 is in lst[6:] (which is [6, 3, 0]), so 2 is appended to new_list.
7. i is 6, lst[6] is 6, 6 is in lst[7:] (which is [3, 0]), so 6 is appended to new_list.
8. i is 7, lst[7] is 3, 3 is not in lst[8:] (which is [0]), so new_list remains [2, 6, 2].
9. i is 8, lst[8] is 0, 0 is not in lst[9:] (which is []), so new_list remains [2, 6, 2].

Since the length of new_list is 3, the function returns [2, 6, 2] as the output.
