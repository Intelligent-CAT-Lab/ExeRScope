The function f takes a string text as input. It initializes an empty list chars. Then it iterates over each character c in the text. If c is a digit, it appends c to the list chars. After the loop, it reverses the list chars and joins its elements into a string. The reversed string is then returned.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input '--4yrw 251-//4 6p', the function first checks each character. The digits are 4, 2, 5, 1, 4, and 6. These are appended to the list chars in the order they are found. Then the list is reversed, so the digits are in the order 6, 4, 1, 5, 2, 4. Finally, the digits are joined into a string, which is '641524'.

<<<Output>>>
'641524'
