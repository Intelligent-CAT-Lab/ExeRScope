The function f takes an array, a number x, and an index i as input. It first checks if the index i is within the valid range of the array. If not, it returns 'no'. If the index is valid, it replaces the element at index i with x in the array and returns the updated array.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], 11, 4, we need to replace the element at index 4 with 11 in the array.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], 11, 4 is [1,2,3,4,11,6,7,8,9,10].

<<<Output>>>
[1,2,3,4,11,6,7,8,9,10]
