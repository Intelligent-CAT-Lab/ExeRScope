The function f takes a string s and a separator sep as input. It splits the string s into a list of substrings using the separator sep. Then it prepends each substring with '*' and reverses the list. Finally, it joins the elements of the list into a string with ';' as the separator.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'volume' and 'l', we need to follow the steps of the function:
1. Split 'volume' into ['vo', '', 'um', 'e'] using 'l' as the separator.
2. Prepend each substring with '*'. The result is ['*vo', '*', '*um', '*e'].
3. Reverse the list. The result is ['*e', '*um', '', '*vo'].
4. Join the elements of the list into a string with ';' as the separator. The result is '*e;*um;;*vo'.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'volume' and 'l' is '*e;*um;;*vo'.

<<<Output>>>
'*e;*um;;*vo'
