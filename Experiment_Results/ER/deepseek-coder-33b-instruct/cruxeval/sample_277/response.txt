The function f takes a list lst and a boolean mode as input. It first creates a new list result that is a copy of the input list lst. If the boolean mode is True, it reverses the order of the elements in the result list. Finally, it returns the result list.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 2, 3, 4] and 1, we first create a new list result that is a copy of the input list [1, 2, 3, 4]. Since the boolean mode is True, we reverse the order of the elements in the result list. Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 2, 3, 4] and 1 is [4, 3, 2, 1].

<<<Output>>>
[4, 3, 2, 1]
