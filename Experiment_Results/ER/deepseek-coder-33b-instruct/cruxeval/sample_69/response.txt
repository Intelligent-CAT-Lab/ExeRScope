The function f takes a dictionary student_marks and a string name as input. It checks if the name is a key in the dictionary student_marks. If it is, it removes the key-value pair from the dictionary and returns the value. If the name is not a key in the dictionary, it returns the string 'Name unknown'.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input ```{'882afmfp': 56}``` and ```'6f53p'```, we need to check if '6f53p' is a key in the dictionary ```{'882afmfp': 56}```. Since it is not, the function returns the string 'Name unknown'.

<<<Output>>>
'Name unknown'
