The function f takes a list of strings txt and a string alpha as input. It first sorts the list txt in ascending order. Then it checks if the index of alpha in the sorted list txt is even. If it is, it returns the reversed list txt. If it is not, it returns the original list txt.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input ['8', '9', '7', '4', '3', '2'] and '9', we need to follow the steps above.

First, we sort the list ['8', '9', '7', '4', '3', '2'] to get ['2', '3', '4', '7', '8', '9'].
Then, we find the index of '9' in the sorted list, which is 5. Since 5 is not an even number, the condition txt.index(alpha) % 2 == 0 is not met.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input ['8', '9', '7', '4', '3', '2'] and '9' is ['2', '3', '4', '7', '8', '9'].

<<<Output>>>
['2', '3', '4', '7', '8', '9']
