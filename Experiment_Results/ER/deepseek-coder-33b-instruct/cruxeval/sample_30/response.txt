The function f takes an array as input. It initializes an empty list result. Then it iterates over each element in the array. For each element, it checks if the element is ascii or if it is an integer and its absolute value is not ascii. If either condition is true, it appends the element to the result list. Finally, it returns the result list.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input ["a", "b", "c"], we need to check each element in the array. The first element "a" is ascii, so it is added to the result list. The second element "b" is ascii, so it is also added to the result list. The third element "c" is ascii, so it is also added to the result list. Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input ["a", "b", "c"] is ["a", "b", "c"].

<<<Output>>>
['a', 'b', 'c']
