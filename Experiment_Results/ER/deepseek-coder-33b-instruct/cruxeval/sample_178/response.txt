The function f takes an array and an integer n as input. It returns a new array that starts from the nth index of the input array.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2] and 4, we need to slice the array from the 4th index.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2] and 4 is [2, 2, 2, 2].

<<<Output>>>
[2, 2, 2, 2]
