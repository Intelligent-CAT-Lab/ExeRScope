The function f takes an integer n as input. It converts the integer n into a string, then into a list of characters. It then iterates over the list from the second element to the end, appending a '+' to each element. Finally, it returns the modified list.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 44, we need to follow the steps outlined above.

1. Convert 44 into a string: '44'
2. Convert '44' into a list: ['4', '4']
3. Iterate over the list from the second element to the end, appending a '+' to each element: ['4', '4', '+']

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 44 is ['4', '4', '+'].

<<<Output>>>
['4', '4', '+']
