The function f takes a string text as input. It first initializes a list result_list with four elements '3'. Then it checks if result_list is not empty. If it's not empty, it clears the list. Finally, it returns the length of the input text.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "mrq7y", we need to follow the steps of the function:
1. Initialize result_list with four elements '3'.
2. Check if result_list is not empty. Since it's not empty, it clears the list.
3. Return the length of the input text, which is 5.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "mrq7y" is 5.
