The function f takes a string x as input. It first calculates the length of the string and assigns it to the variable n. Then it initializes a variable i to 0. It enters a while loop that continues as long as i is less than n and the character at index i in the string x is a digit. Inside the loop, it increments i by 1. After the loop, it checks if i is equal to n. If it is, it means all characters in the string x are digits, so it returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input '1', we need to follow the steps of the function.

1. n = len('1') = 1
2. i = 0
3. '1'[0].isdigit() is True, so i is incremented to 1
4. i < n is False, so the loop ends
5. i == n is True, so the function returns True

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input '1' is True.
