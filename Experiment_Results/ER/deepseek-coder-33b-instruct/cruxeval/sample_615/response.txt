The function f takes a list and a number as input. It first appends the number to the list. Then it finds the index of the maximum value in the list excluding the last appended number.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input ```([-1, 12, -6, -2], -1)```, we need to follow the steps:
1. Append the number to the list: ```[-1, 12, -6, -2, -1]```
2. Find the maximum value in the list excluding the last appended number: ```12```
3. Find the index of the maximum value: ```1```

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input ```([-1, 12, -6, -2], -1)``` is ```1```.
