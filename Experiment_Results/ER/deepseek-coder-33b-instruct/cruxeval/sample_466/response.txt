The function f takes a string text as input. It first calculates the length of the text and initializes an index to 0. Then it enters a while loop that continues until the index is less than the length of the text and the character at the current index is a whitespace. Inside the loop, it increments the index.

After the loop, it returns a substring of text from the current index to the index plus 5.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input '-----\t\n\tth\n-----', we need to follow the steps of the function.

1. The length of the text is 11.
2. The index starts at 0.
3. The character at index 0 is '-', which is a whitespace. So, the index is incremented to 1.
4. The character at index 1 is also '-', which is a whitespace. So, the index is incremented to 2.
5. The character at index 2 is also '-', which is a whitespace. So, the index is incremented to 3.
6. The character at index 3 is also '-', which is a whitespace. So, the index is incremented to 4.
7. The character at index 4 is a tab ('\t'), which is a whitespace. So, the index is incremented to 5.
8. The character at index 5 is a newline ('\n'), which is a whitespace. So, the index is incremented to 6.
9. The character at index 6 is a tab ('\t'), which is a whitespace. So, the index is incremented to 7.
10. The character at index 7 is 't', which is not a whitespace. So, the loop ends.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input '-----\t\n\tth\n-----' is 'th'.
