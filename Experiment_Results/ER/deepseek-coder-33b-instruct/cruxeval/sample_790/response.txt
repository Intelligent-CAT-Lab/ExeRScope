The function f takes a dictionary d as input. It creates a new dictionary r with two keys 'c' and 'd'. The value for each key is a copy of the input dictionary d.

The function then returns a tuple with two values. The first value is a boolean that checks if the dictionaries r['c'] and r['d'] are the same object (i.e., they are the same dictionary). The second value is a boolean that checks if the dictionaries r['c'] and r['d'] are equal (i.e., they have the same keys and values).

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input {'i': 1, 'love': 'parakeets'}, we need to follow the steps in the function.

First, we create a new dictionary r with two keys 'c' and 'd'. The value for each key is a copy of the input dictionary {'i': 1, 'love': 'parakeets'}.

Then, we return a tuple with two values. The first value is a boolean that checks if the dictionaries r['c'] and r['d'] are the same object. Since r['c'] and r['d'] are copies of the same dictionary, they are the same object, so the first value is True.

The second value is a boolean that checks if the dictionaries r['c'] and r['d'] are equal. Since r['c'] and r['d'] are copies of the same dictionary, they are equal, so the second value is True.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input {'i': 1, 'love': 'parakeets'} is (True, True).
