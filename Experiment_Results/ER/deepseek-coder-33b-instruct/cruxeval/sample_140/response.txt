The function f takes a string st as input. It first converts the string to lowercase using the lower() method. Then it finds the last index of 'h' in the string using the rindex() method. It then finds the last index of 'i' in the string using the rindex() method. If the index of the last 'h' that is before the last 'i' is greater than or equal to the index of the last 'i', it returns 'Hey'. Otherwise, it returns 'Hi'.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'Hi there', we need to follow the steps of the function.

1. Convert 'Hi there' to 'hi there'
2. Find the last index of 'h' in 'hi there', which is 1
3. Find the last index of 'i' in 'hi there', which is 2
4. Since 1 is not greater than or equal to 2, the function returns 'Hi'

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'Hi there' is 'Hi'.

<<<Output>>>
'Hi'
