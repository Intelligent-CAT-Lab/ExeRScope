The function f takes an input string and a number of spaces as input. It uses the expandtabs() method of the string class to replace all tab characters in the string with the specified number of spaces.

In the given example, the input string is r'a\tb', which is a raw string literal representing the string "a" followed by a tab character and then "b". The number of spaces is 4.

The expandtabs() method will replace the tab character with 4 spaces. So, the output of executing the function f on the input r'a\tb' and 4 is the string "a    b".

<<<Output>>>
'a    b'
