The function f takes an array as input. It first makes a copy of the input array and then reverses the copy. After that, it squares each element in the reversed array and returns the new array.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 2, 1], we need to follow the steps:
1. Make a copy of the input array: [1, 2, 1]
2. Reverse the copied array: [1, 2, 1]
3. Square each element in the reversed array: [1, 4, 1]

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 2, 1] is [1, 4, 1].

<<<Output>>>
[1, 4, 1]
