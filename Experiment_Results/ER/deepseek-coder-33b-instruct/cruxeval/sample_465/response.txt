The function f takes a list of strings seq and a string value as input. It first creates a dictionary roles with keys from seq and values as 'north'. Then, if value is not empty, it updates the dictionary roles with keys from value split by ', ' and values as the stripped keys. Finally, it returns the dictionary roles.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input ```(['wise king', 'young king'], '')```, we need to follow the steps of the function.

First, it creates a dictionary roles with keys from ['wise king', 'young king'] and values as 'north'.

Then, since the value is an empty string, it does not update the dictionary roles.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input ```(['wise king', 'young king'], '')``` is ```{'wise king': 'north', 'young king': 'north'}```.

<<<Output>>>
{'wise king': 'north', 'young king': 'north'}
