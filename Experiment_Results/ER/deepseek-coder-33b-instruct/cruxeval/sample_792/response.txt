The function f takes two lists l1 and l2 as input. It first checks if the lengths of the two lists are equal. If they are not, it returns an empty dictionary. If they are equal, it creates a new dictionary using the elements of l1 as keys and l2 as values.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input ['a', 'b'] and ['car', 'dog'], we first check if the lengths of the two lists are equal. They are, so we create a new dictionary using the elements of the first list as keys and the elements of the second list as values.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input ['a', 'b'] and ['car', 'dog'] is {'a': ['car', 'dog'], 'b': ['car', 'dog']}.

<<<Output>>>
{'a': ['car', 'dog'], 'b': ['car', 'dog']}
