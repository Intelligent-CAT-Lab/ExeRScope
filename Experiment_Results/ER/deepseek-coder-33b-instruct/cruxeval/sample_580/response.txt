The function f takes a string text and a character char as input. It initializes a new_text with the value of text and an empty list a. Then it enters a while loop that continues as long as char is in new_text.

In each iteration of the loop, it appends the index of the first occurrence of char in new_text to the list a, and then removes the first occurrence of char from new_text.

When the loop finishes, it returns the list a.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'rvr' and 'r', we need to follow the steps of the function.

1. Initialize new_text with 'rvr' and a as an empty list.
2. Enter the while loop because 'r' is in 'rvr'.
3. Append the index of 'r' in 'rvr' to a, which is 0. Then remove the first 'r' from 'rvr', resulting in 'vr'.
4. Enter the while loop again because 'r' is in 'vr'.
5. Append the index of 'r' in 'vr' to a, which is 1. Then remove the first 'r' from 'vr', resulting in 'v'.
6. Enter the while loop again because 'r' is in 'v'.
7. Append the index of 'r' in 'v' to a, which is 0. Then remove the first 'r' from 'v', resulting in an empty string.
8. Exit the while loop because 'r' is not in an empty string.
9. Return a, which is [0, 1, 0].

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'rvr' and 'r' is [0, 1, 0].

<<<Output>>>
[0, 1, 0]
