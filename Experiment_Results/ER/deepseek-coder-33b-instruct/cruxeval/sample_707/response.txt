The function f takes a string text and an integer position as input. It first calculates the length of the text and then calculates the index by taking the modulus of the position and the length of the text plus one. If the position is less than zero or the index is less than zero, it sets the index to -1. It then converts the text to a list of characters, removes the character at the calculated index, and joins the remaining characters back into a string.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'undbs l' and 1, we need to follow the steps outlined above.

First, the length of the text 'undbs l' is 7.
Then, the index is calculated as 1 % 8 = 1.
Since both the position and the index are non-negative, the index remains 1.
The text is converted to a list of characters ['u', 'n', 'd', 'b', 's', ' ', 'l'].
The character at index 1 is removed, resulting in the list ['u', 'd', 'b', 's', ' ', 'l'].
Finally, the list is joined back into a string, resulting in 'udbs l'.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'undbs l' and 1 is 'udbs l'.

<<<Output>>>
'udbs l'
