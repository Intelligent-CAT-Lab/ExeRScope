The function f takes a list of numbers, an element, and an index as input. It inserts the given element at the given index in the list and then returns the modified list.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input ```([1, 2, 3], 8, 5)```, we need to insert 8 at index 5 in the list [1, 2, 3]. However, the list only has 3 elements, so the index 5 is out of range. Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input ```([1, 2, 3], 8, 5)``` is an IndexError.

<<<Output>>>
IndexError: list assignment index out of range
