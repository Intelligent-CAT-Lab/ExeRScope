The function f takes a string text as input. It initializes an empty string result. Then it iterates over each character in the text. If the character is alphanumeric (i.e., a letter or a number), it converts the character to uppercase and appends it to the result string. Finally, it returns the result string.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'с bishop.Swift', we need to follow the steps of the function:

1. Initialize result as an empty string.
2. Iterate over each character in the string 'с bishop.Swift'.
3. The first character 'с' is not alphanumeric, so it is skipped.
4. The second character ' ' (space) is not alphanumeric, so it is skipped.
5. The third character 'b' is alphanumeric, so it is converted to uppercase and appended to the result string, resulting in 'B'.
6. The fourth character 'i' is alphanumeric, so it is converted to uppercase and appended to the result string, resulting in 'BI'.
7. The fifth character 's' is alphanumeric, so it is converted to uppercase and appended to the result string, resulting in 'BIS'.
8. The sixth character 'h' is alphanumeric, so it is converted to uppercase and appended to the result string, resulting in 'BISH'.
9. The seventh character 'o' is alphanumeric, so it is converted to uppercase and appended to the result string, resulting in 'BISHО'.
10. The eighth character 'p' is alphanumeric, so it is converted to uppercase and appended to the result string, resulting in 'BISHОP'.
11. The ninth character '.' is not alphanumeric, so it is skipped.
12. The tenth character 'S' is alphanumeric, so it is converted to uppercase and appended to the result string, resulting in 'BISHОPS'.
13. The eleventh character 'w' is alphanumeric, so it is converted to uppercase and appended to the result string, resulting in 'BISHОPSW'.
14. The twelfth character 'i' is alphanumeric, so it is converted to uppercase and appended to the result string, resulting in 'BISHОPSWI'.
15. The thirteenth character 'f' is alphanumeric, so it is converted to uppercase and appended to the result string, resulting in 'BISHОPSWIF'.
16. The fourteenth character 't' is alphanumeric, so it is converted to uppercase and appended to the result string, resulting in 'BISHОPSWIFT'.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'с bishop.Swift' is 'BISHОPSWIFT'.

<<<Output>>>
'BISHОPSWIFT'
