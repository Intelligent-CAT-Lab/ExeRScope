The function f takes a string text as input. It checks if the string is not in title case using the istitle() method. If the string is not in title case, it converts the string to title case using the title() method and returns it. If the string is already in title case, it converts the string to lower case using the lower() method and returns it.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "PermissioN is GRANTed", we need to check if the string is in title case. The string "PermissioN is GRANTed" is not in title case, so the function converts the string to title case. The title case of "PermissioN is GRANTed" is "Permission Is Granted".

<<<Output>>>
'Permission Is Granted'
