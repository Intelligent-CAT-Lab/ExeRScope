The function f takes an array as input. It initializes a new array newArray with the same elements as the input array. It then iterates over the elements of the input array starting from the second element. For each element, it checks if it is different from the previous element. If it is different, it replaces the corresponding element in newArray with the current element. If it is the same, it deletes the corresponding element in newArray. Finally, it returns the new array.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 2, 3], we need to follow the steps of the function.

1. Initialize prev with the first element of the array, which is 1.
2. Initialize newArray with the same elements as the input array, which is [1, 2, 3].
3. For the second element of the array, which is 2, it is different from the previous element, so it replaces the second element of newArray with 2.
4. For the third element of the array, which is 3, it is different from the previous element, so it replaces the third element of newArray with 3.
5. The function returns newArray, which is [1, 2, 3].

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 2, 3] is [1, 2, 3].

<<<Output>>>
[1, 2, 3]
