The function f takes two strings s1 and s2 as input. It then enters a loop that runs for the length of s2 plus the length of s1. In each iteration of the loop, it appends the first character of s1 to the end of s1. Then it checks if s2 is a substring of s1. If it is, it returns True. If it never finds s2 as a substring of s1, it returns False.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "Hello" and ")". The loop will run for 6 times (5 + 1). In each iteration, it will append the first character of s1 to the end of s1. After the first iteration, s1 will be "HelloHe". In the second iteration, it will be "HelloHeHe". In the third iteration, it will be "HelloHeHeHe". In the fourth iteration, it will be "HelloHeHeHeHe". In the fifth iteration, it will be "HelloHeHeHeHeHe". In the sixth iteration, it will be "HelloHeHeHeHeHeHe".

In each iteration, it will not find ")" as a substring of s1, so it will return False.
