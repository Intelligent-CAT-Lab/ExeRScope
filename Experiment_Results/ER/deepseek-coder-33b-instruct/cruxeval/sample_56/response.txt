The function f takes a string sentence as input. It then iterates over each character c in the sentence. For each character, it checks if c is an ASCII character using the isascii() method. If c is not an ASCII character, the function immediately returns False. If c is an ASCII character, the function continues to the next character in the sentence. If the function iterates over all characters in the sentence without returning False, it returns True.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input '1z1z1', the function checks each character in the string. The first character '1' is an ASCII character, so the function continues to the next character. The second character 'z' is not an ASCII character, so the function returns False.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input '1z1z1' is False.
