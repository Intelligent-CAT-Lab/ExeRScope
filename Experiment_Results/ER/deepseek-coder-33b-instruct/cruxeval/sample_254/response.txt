The function f takes two strings as input: text and repl. It first creates a translation table using the str.maketrans method, which maps each character in the first string to the corresponding character in the second string. The str.lower method is used to ensure that the translation is case-insensitive.

Next, the translate method is called on the text string, which applies the translation table to the string. The translate method replaces each character in the text string with the corresponding character in the translation table.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'upper case' and 'lower case', we need to create a translation table that maps each character in 'upper case' to the corresponding character in 'lower case'. Then, we apply this translation table to the string 'upper case'.

The output of executing the function f on the input 'upper case' and 'lower case' is 'lower case'.

<<<Output>>>
'lower case'
