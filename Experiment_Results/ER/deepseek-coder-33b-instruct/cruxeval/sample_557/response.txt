The function f takes a string str as input. It uses the rpartition method of the string class to split the string into three parts. The rpartition method splits the string at the last occurrence of 'ar' and returns a tuple containing the three parts. The first part is the part before 'ar', the second part is 'ar', and the third part is the part after 'ar'.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'xxxarmmarxx', the rpartition method splits the string into three parts: 'xxxarmm', 'ar', and 'xx'. Then, the join method is used to concatenate these three parts with a space in between.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'xxxarmmarxx' is 'xxxarmm ar xx'.

<<<Output>>>
'xxxarmm ar xx'
