The function f takes a string text as input. It converts the string into a list of characters. Then it iterates over the list. For each character, it checks if it is not equal to '+'. If it is not equal to '+', it inserts '*' and '+' at the current index and breaks the loop. Finally, it joins all the characters in the list with '+' and returns the resulting string.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'nzoh', we need to follow the steps of the function.

1. Convert 'nzoh' to a list of characters: ['n', 'z', 'o', 'h']
2. Iterate over the list. For the first character 'n', it is not equal to '+', so it inserts '*' and '+' at the beginning of the list: ['*', '+', 'n', 'z', 'o', 'h']
3. Break the loop because we have inserted '*' and '+' at the beginning of the list.
4. Join all the characters in the list with '+' to get the final string: '*+nzoh'

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'nzoh' is '*+nzoh'.

<<<Output>>>
'*+nzoh'
