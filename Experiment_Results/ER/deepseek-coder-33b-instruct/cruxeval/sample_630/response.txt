The function f takes two arguments: original and string. It first creates a copy of the original dictionary. Then it iterates over the items in the string dictionary. For each item, it adds a new key-value pair to the temp dictionary where the key is the value from the string dictionary and the value is the key from the string dictionary. Finally, it returns the temp dictionary.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input {1: -9, 0: -7} and {1: 2, 0: 3}, we need to follow the steps of the function.

1. First, it creates a copy of the original dictionary {1: -9, 0: -7}.
2. Then it iterates over the items in the string dictionary {1: 2, 0: 3}.
3. For each item, it adds a new key-value pair to the temp dictionary where the key is the value from the string dictionary and the value is the key from the string dictionary.

So, the output of executing the function f on the input {1: -9, 0: -7} and {1: 2, 0: 3} is {-9: 1, -7: 0, 2: 1, 3: 0}.

<<<Output>>>
{-9: 1, -7: 0, 2: 1, 3: 0}
