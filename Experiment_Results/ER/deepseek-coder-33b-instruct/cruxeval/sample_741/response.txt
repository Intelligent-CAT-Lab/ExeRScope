The function f takes a list of numbers nums and an integer p as input. It calculates the index of the previous number in the list by subtracting 1 from p. If the calculated index is less than 0, it sets the index to the last index of the list. Finally, it returns the number at the calculated index.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [6, 8, 2, 5, 3, 1, 9, 7] and 6, we need to calculate the index of the previous number in the list. The index of the previous number is 5 (6 - 1). The number at index 5 in the list is 3.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [6, 8, 2, 5, 3, 1, 9, 7] and 6 is 3.
