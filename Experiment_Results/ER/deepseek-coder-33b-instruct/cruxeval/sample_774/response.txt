The function f takes two inputs: a number num and a string name. It then creates a string f_str with placeholders for the name and num. The format method of the string f_str is then called with name and num as arguments, replacing the placeholders with the actual values. The resulting string is returned by the function.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input (23, 'Cornareti'), we need to replace the placeholders in the string f_str with the actual values. Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input (23, 'Cornareti') is 'quiz leader = Cornareti, count = 23'.

<<<Output>>>
'quiz leader = Cornareti, count = 23'
