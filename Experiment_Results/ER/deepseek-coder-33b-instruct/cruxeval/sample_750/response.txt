The function f takes a dictionary char_map and a string text as input. It initializes an empty string new_text. Then it iterates over each character in the text. For each character, it tries to get the value from the char_map dictionary. If the value is None, it appends the character to new_text. If the value is not None, it appends the value to new_text. Finally, it returns new_text.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input `f({}, 'hbd')`, we need to iterate over each character in 'hbd'. Since the char_map is empty, it will append each character to new_text. Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input `f({}, 'hbd')` is 'hbd'.

<<<Output>>>
'hbd'
