The function f takes a string text as input. It splits the text into a list of words using the split() method. Then it creates a dictionary where the keys are 'first', 'second', 'third', and 'fourth' and the values are the corresponding elements from the list of words. Finally, it returns a formatted string where the placeholders ${first}, ${second}, ${third}, and ${fourth} are replaced with the corresponding values from the dictionary.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'python ruby c javascript', we need to split the input into a list of words. The list of words is ['python', 'ruby', 'c', 'javascript']. Then we create a dictionary where the keys are 'first', 'second', 'third', and 'fourth' and the values are the corresponding elements from the list of words. The dictionary is {'first': 'python', 'second': 'ruby', 'third': 'c', 'fourth': 'javascript'}. Finally, we replace the placeholders ${first}, ${second}, ${third}, and ${fourth} in the formatted string with the corresponding values from the dictionary. The output of executing the function f on the input 'python ruby c javascript' is 'pythony, rubyx, cy, javascriptp'.

<<<Output>>>
'pythony, rubyx, cy, javascriptp'
