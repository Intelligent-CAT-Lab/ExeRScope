The function f takes a list of integers as input. It initializes an empty dictionary dic. Then it iterates over each number n in the list. If n is already a key in the dictionary dic, it appends n to the value list associated with n. If n is not a key in dic, it creates a new key-value pair where n is the key and the value is a list of all numbers in the list up to and including n.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [5, 2, 7, 2, 3, 5], we need to follow the steps of the function.

1. dic = {}
2. n = 5, 5 is not in dic, so dic[5] = [5]
3. n = 2, 2 is not in dic, so dic[2] = [2]
4. n = 7, 7 is not in dic, so dic[7] = [7]
5. n = 2, 2 is already in dic, so dic[2] = [2, 2]
6. n = 3, 3 is not in dic, so dic[3] = [3]
7. n = 5, 5 is already in dic, so dic[5] = [5, 5]

So, the output of executing the function f on the input [5, 2, 7, 2, 3, 5] is {5: [5, 5], 2: [2, 2], 7: [7], 3: [3]}.

<<<Output>>>
{5: [5, 5], 2: [2, 2], 7: [7], 3: [3]}
