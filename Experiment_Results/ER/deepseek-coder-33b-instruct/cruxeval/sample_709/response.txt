The function f takes a string text as input. It splits the string into a list of words using the split() method. Then it sorts the list in reverse order using the sort() method with the reverse=True argument. Finally, it joins the sorted list back into a string using the join() method and returns it.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'a loved', we need to follow the steps outlined above.

1. Split the string 'a loved' into a list of words: ['a', 'loved']
2. Sort the list in reverse order: ['loved', 'a']
3. Join the sorted list back into a string: 'loved a'

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'a loved' is 'loved a'.

<<<Output>>>
'loved a'
