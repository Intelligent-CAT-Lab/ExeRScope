The function f takes a list of numbers as input. It first calculates the length of the list and then iterates over a list of indices where each index is the remainder of the index divided by 2. For each index, it appends the element at that index in the original list to the end of the list. Finally, it returns the modified list.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1], we need to follow the steps of the function.

1. The length of the list is 5.
2. The list of indices is [0, 1, 0, 1, 0].
3. For each index, it appends the element at that index in the original list to the end of the list. So, it appends -1, 0, 0, 1, 1 to the end of the list.
4. The final list is [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1, -1, 0, 0, 1, 1].

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] is [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1, -1, 0, 0, 1, 1].

<<<Output>>>
[-1, 0, 0, 1, 1, -1, 0, 0, 1, 1]
