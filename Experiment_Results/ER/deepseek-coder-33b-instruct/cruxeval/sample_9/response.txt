The function f takes a string t as input. It then iterates over each character c in the string t. If the character c is not numeric (i.e., it is not a digit), the function immediately returns False. If the function iterates over all characters in the string t without finding a non-numeric character, it returns True.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "#284376598", the function checks each character in the string. The first character is "#", which is not a digit, so the function immediately returns False.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "#284376598" is False.
