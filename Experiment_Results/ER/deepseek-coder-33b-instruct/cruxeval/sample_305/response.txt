The function f takes a string text and a character char as input. It first calculates the length of the text and initializes the index to -1. Then it iterates over the text, checking if each character is equal to the input character. If it finds a match, it updates the index to the current position. If it doesn't find a match, it sets the index to half the length of the text. After that, it converts the text to a list, removes the character at the index, and joins the list back into a string. The function then returns the new string.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'o horseto' and 'r', we need to follow the steps of the function. The length of the text is 8, and the character 'r' is not found in the text. Therefore, the index is set to 4 (half of 8). The character at index 4 in the text is ' ', a space. We remove this space from the text, and the function returns the string 'o horseo'.

<<<Output>>>
'o horseo'
