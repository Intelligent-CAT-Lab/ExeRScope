The function f takes an array and an element as input. It first finds the index of the element in the array using the index() method. Then it returns the product of the index and 2 plus the product of the element at the index from the end of the array and 3.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [[-1, 2, 1, -8, 2], 2], we need to find the index of 2 in the array. The index of 2 is 1 (Python uses 0-based indexing). So, the output of executing the function f on the input [[-1, 2, 1, -8, 2], 2] is 1 * 2 + -8 * 3 = 2 - 24 = -22.

<<<Output>>>
-22
