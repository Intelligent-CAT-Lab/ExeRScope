The function f takes a string text as input. It splits the input string into two parts at the comma. The first part is assigned to string_a and the second part is assigned to string_b. Then it returns the negative sum of the lengths of string_a and string_b.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'dog,cat', the function first splits the input string into 'dog' and 'cat'. Then it calculates the lengths of 'dog' and 'cat' which are 3 and 3 respectively. The sum of these lengths is 6. The negative of this sum is -6.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'dog,cat' is -6.

<<<Output>>>
-6
