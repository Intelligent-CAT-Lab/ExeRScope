The function f takes a list of numbers as input. It iterates over a copy of the list (to avoid skipping elements during iteration). If the number is odd, it removes it from the original list. After that, it sums up all the remaining numbers in the list and returns the sum.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [11, 21, 0, 11], we need to follow the steps of the function:

1. The function starts by creating a copy of the input list.
2. It then iterates over the copy. The first number is 11, which is odd, so it is removed from the original list.
3. The second number is 21, which is odd, so it is removed from the original list.
4. The third number is 0, which is not odd, so it is not removed from the original list.
5. The fourth number is 11, which is odd, so it is removed from the original list.
6. The list now contains only the number 0.
7. The function then sums up all the numbers in the list (which is just 0) and returns the sum.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [11, 21, 0, 11] is 0.
