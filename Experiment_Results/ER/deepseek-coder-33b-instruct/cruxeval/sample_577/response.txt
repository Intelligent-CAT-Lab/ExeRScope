The function f takes a list of tuples as input. It initializes an empty list result. Then it iterates over each tuple in the input list. For each tuple, it creates a copy of the input list as a dictionary d. It then removes the last item from the dictionary d. The removed item is not used anywhere in the code. The dictionary d is then appended to the result list. The input list items is then updated to be the dictionary d. This process is repeated until there are no more items in the input list. The function finally returns the result list.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [(1, 'pos')], we need to follow the steps of the function.

1. The input list [(1, 'pos')] is converted to a dictionary {1: 'pos'}.
2. The last item from the dictionary is removed, which is not used anywhere in the code.
3. The dictionary is appended to the result list.
4. The input list is updated to be the dictionary.
5. The process is repeated, but the input list is empty, so the function returns the result list.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [(1, 'pos')] is [{}].
