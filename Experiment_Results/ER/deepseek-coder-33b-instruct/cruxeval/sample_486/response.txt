The function f takes a dictionary dic as input. It first makes a copy of the input dictionary dic_op. Then it iterates over each key-value pair in the input dictionary. For each key-value pair, it squares the value and assigns the result back to the corresponding key in the output dictionary dic_op. Finally, it returns the output dictionary dic_op.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input {1:1, 2:2, 3:3}, we need to square each value in the input dictionary. Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input {1:1, 2:2, 3:3} is {1:1, 2:4, 3:9}.

<<<Output>>>
{1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9}
