The function f takes a string text and a character ch as input. It counts the number of occurrences of the character ch in the string text.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "This be Pirate's Speak for 'help'!", ' ', we need to count the number of spaces in the string "This be Pirate's Speak for 'help'!".

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "This be Pirate's Speak for 'help'!", ' ' is 5.
