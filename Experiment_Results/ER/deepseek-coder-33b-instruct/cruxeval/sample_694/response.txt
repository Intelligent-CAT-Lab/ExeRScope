The function f takes a dictionary d as input. It first calculates the index of the last key in the dictionary by subtracting 1 from the length of the dictionary. Then it retrieves the last key from the dictionary using the calculated index. It removes the last key-value pair from the dictionary using the pop method. Finally, it returns the last key and the modified dictionary.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input dict(e=1, d=2, c=3), we need to follow the steps mentioned above.

First, the length of the dictionary is 3. So, the index of the last key is 3 - 1 = 2.
The keys in the dictionary are 'e', 'd', 'c'. So, the last key is 'c'.
After removing the last key-value pair ('c', 3), the dictionary becomes dict(e=1, d=2).

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input dict(e=1, d=2, c=3) is ('c', dict(e=1, d=2)).

<<<Output>>>
('c', {'e': 1, 'd': 2})
