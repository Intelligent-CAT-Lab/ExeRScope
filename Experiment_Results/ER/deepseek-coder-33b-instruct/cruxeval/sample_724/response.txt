The function f takes a string text and a function as input. It first finds the index of the function in the text and calculates the length of the remaining string after the function. This value is stored in the list cites. Then it iterates over each character in the text. If the character is equal to the function, it calculates the length of the remaining string after the function and appends it to the list cites. Finally, it returns the list cites.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "010100" and "010", we need to follow the steps of the function.

1. The function "010" is found at index 0 in the text "010100". The length of the remaining string after "010" is 4. This value is stored in the list cites.
2. The function "010" is found at index 2 in the text "010100". The length of the remaining string after "010" is 2. This value is appended to the list cites.
3. The function "010" is found at index 4 in the text "010100". The length of the remaining string after "010" is 0. This value is appended to the list cites.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "010100" and "010" is [4, 2, 0].

<<<Output>>>
[4, 2, 0]
