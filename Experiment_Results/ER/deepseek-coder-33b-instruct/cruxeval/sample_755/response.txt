The function f takes three parameters: replace, text, and hide. It replaces the first occurrence of hide in text with replace, and then appends 'ax' to replace. This process repeats until hide is no longer found in text. The final value of text is returned.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input '###', "ph>t#A#BiEcDefW#ON#iiNCU", '.', we need to follow the steps of the function.

1. The function starts with replace as '###' and text as "ph>t#A#BiEcDefW#ON#iiNCU".
2. The function finds the first occurrence of '.' in text, which is at index 2.
3. It replaces '.' with replace, which is '###ax', and updates text to "ph>t#A#B###axiEcDefW#ON#iiNCU".
4. The function finds the next occurrence of '.' in text, which is at index 10.
5. It replaces '.' with replace, which is '###axax', and updates text to "ph>t#A#B###axEcDefW#ON#i###axNCU".
6. The function finds the next occurrence of '.' in text, which is at index 18.
7. It replaces '.' with replace, which is '###axaxax', and updates text to "ph>t#A#B###axEcDefW#O###axN###axCU".
8. The function finds the next occurrence of '.' in text, which is at index 26.
9. It replaces '.' with replace, which is '###axaxaxax', and updates text to "ph>t#A#B###axEcDefW#O###axN###axCU".
10. The function does not find any more occurrences of '.' in text, so it stops.
11. The function returns the final value of text, which is "ph>t#A#B###axEcDefW#O###axN###axCU".

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input '###', "ph>t#A#BiEcDefW#ON#iiNCU", '.' is "ph>t#A#B###axEcDefW#O###axN###axCU".

<<<Output>>>
'ph>t#A#B###axEcDefW#O###axN###axCU'
