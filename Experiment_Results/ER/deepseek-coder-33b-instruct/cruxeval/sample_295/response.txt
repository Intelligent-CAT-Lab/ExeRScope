The function f takes a list of fruits as input. It checks if the first and last elements of the list are the same. If they are, it returns 'no'. If they are not, it removes the first and last elements of the list twice, and then returns the remaining list.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input ['apple', 'apple', 'pear', 'banana', 'pear', 'orange', 'orange'], we need to follow the steps of the function.

First, it checks if the first and last elements of the list are the same. They are, so it does not return 'no'.

Next, it removes the first and last elements of the list twice. The list becomes ['apple', 'pear', 'banana', 'pear'].

Finally, it removes the first and last elements of the list twice again. The list becomes ['pear'].

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input ['apple', 'apple', 'pear', 'banana', 'pear', 'orange', 'orange'] is ['pear'].

<<<Output>>>
['pear']
