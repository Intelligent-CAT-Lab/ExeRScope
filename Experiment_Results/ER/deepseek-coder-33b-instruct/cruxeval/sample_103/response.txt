The function f takes a string s as input and returns a new string where all the characters in s are converted to lowercase.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'abcDEFGhIJ', we need to convert all the characters in 'abcDEFGhIJ' to lowercase.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'abcDEFGhIJ' is 'abcdefghij'.

<<<Output>>>
