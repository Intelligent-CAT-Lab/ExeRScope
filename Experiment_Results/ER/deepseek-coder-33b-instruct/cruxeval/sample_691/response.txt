The function f takes two parameters: a string text and a string suffix. It checks if the last character of the suffix is in the text. If it is, it calls itself recursively with the text stripped of the last character of the suffix and the suffix stripped of its last character. If the last character of the suffix is not in the text, it simply returns the text.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'rpyttc' and 'cyt', we need to follow the steps of the function.

1. The last character of the suffix 'cyt' is 't'. This character is in the text 'rpyttc'.
2. The function calls itself with the text 'rpyttc' stripped of the last character 't' and the suffix 'cy' (which is 'cyt' stripped of its last character).
3. The last character of the suffix 'cy' is 'y'. This character is in the text 'rpyttc'.
4. The function calls itself with the text 'rpyttc' stripped of the last character 'y' and the suffix 'c' (which is 'cy' stripped of its last character).
5. The last character of the suffix 'c' is 'c'. This character is in the text 'rpyttc'.
6. The function calls itself with the text 'rpyttc' stripped of the last character 'c' and the suffix '' (which is 'c' stripped of its last character).
7. The suffix is empty, so the function returns the text 'rpyttc'.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'rpyttc' and 'cyt' is 'rpyttc'.

<<<Output>>>
