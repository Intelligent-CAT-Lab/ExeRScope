The function f takes a string text as input. It initializes an empty list ans. Then it iterates over each character in the text. If the character is a digit, it appends the character to the list ans. If the character is not a digit, it appends a space to the list ans. Finally, it joins all the elements in the list ans into a string and returns it.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'm4n2o', we need to follow the steps of the function.

For 'm', it is not a digit, so it appends a space to the list ans.
For '4', it is a digit, so it appends '4' to the list ans.
For 'n', it is not a digit, so it appends a space to the list ans.
For '2', it is a digit, so it appends '2' to the list ans.
For 'o', it is not a digit, so it appends a space to the list ans.

So, the list ans becomes [' ', '4', ' ', '2', ' '].
Finally, it joins all the elements in the list ans into a string and returns it.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'm4n2o' is ' 4 2 '.

<<<Output>>>
