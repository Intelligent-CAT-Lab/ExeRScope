The function f takes a list orig as input. It first makes a copy of the original list and assigns it to the variable copy. Then, it appends the number 100 to the copy. After that, it removes the last element from the original list. Finally, it returns the copy.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 2, 3], we need to follow the steps of the function.

1. The function makes a copy of the original list [1, 2, 3] and assigns it to the variable copy.
2. The function appends the number 100 to the copy, so the copy becomes [1, 2, 3, 100].
3. The function removes the last element from the original list, so the original list becomes [1, 2].
4. The function returns the copy, which is [1, 2, 3, 100].

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 2, 3] is [1, 2, 3, 100].

<<<Output>>>
[1, 2, 3, 100]
