The function f takes a list of numbers as input. It initializes an empty list l. Then it iterates over each number in the input list nums. For each number, it checks if the number is not already in list l. If the number is not in l, it appends the number to l. Finally, it returns the list l.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [3, 1, 9, 0, 2, 0, 8], we need to follow the steps of the function.

1. Initialize l as an empty list.
2. Iterate over each number in the input list.
3. For the first number 3, it is not in l, so it appends 3 to l.
4. For the next number 1, it is not in l, so it appends 1 to l.
5. For the next number 9, it is not in l, so it appends 9 to l.
6. For the next number 0, it is not in l, so it appends 0 to l.
7. For the next number 2, it is not in l, so it appends 2 to l.
8. For the next number 0, it is already in l, so it does not append 0 to l.
9. For the last number 8, it is not in l, so it appends 8 to l.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [3, 1, 9, 0, 2, 0, 8] is [3, 1, 9, 0, 2, 8].

<<<Output>>>
[3, 1, 9, 0, 2, 8]
