The function f takes a list of strings seq and a string v as input. It initializes an empty list a. Then it iterates over each string i in seq. For each string, it checks if i ends with v. If it does, it appends i*2 to a (i.e., it appends i twice to a). Finally, it returns a.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [ 'oH', 'ee', 'mb', 'deft', 'n', 'zz', 'f', 'abA' ] and 'zz', we need to check each string in the list to see if it ends with 'zz'. The strings that end with 'zz' are 'zz' and 'abA'. For each of these strings, we append it twice to a, so a becomes ['zzzz', 'abAabA']. Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [ 'oH', 'ee', 'mb', 'deft', 'n', 'zz', 'f', 'abA' ] and 'zz' is ['zzzz', 'abAabA'].

<<<Output>>>
['zzzz', 'abAabA']
