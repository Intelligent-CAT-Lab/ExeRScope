The function f takes a string text and a string prefix as input. It returns the substring of text starting from the index where prefix ends in text.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input '123x John z' and 'z', we need to find the index where 'z' ends in '123x John z'. The index is 11. Then we return the substring of '123x John z' starting from index 11.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input '123x John z' and 'z' is ' John z'.

<<<Output>>>
' John z'
