The function f takes a string str and an integer n as input. It checks if the length of the string str is less than n. If it is, it returns the string str. If it is not, it removes the first n characters from the string str and returns the result.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "try." and 5, we need to check if the length of the string "try." is less than 5. It is not, so we need to remove the first 5 characters from the string "try.". However, the string "try." does not have 5 characters, so the function will return the original string "try.".

<<<Output>>>
'try.'
