The function f takes a list lst as input. It first clears the list using the clear() method. Then it appends the list with a new list that contains the integer 1 repeated (len(lst) + 1) times. The new list is then returned.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input ['a', 'c', 'v'], we need to follow the steps in the function.

1. The list ['a', 'c', 'v'] is cleared.
2. A new list is created that contains the integer 1 repeated (len(lst) + 1) times. In this case, the length of the list is 3, so the new list is [1, 1, 1, 1].
3. The new list is returned.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input ['a', 'c', 'v'] is [1, 1, 1, 1].

<<<Output>>>
[1, 1, 1, 1]
