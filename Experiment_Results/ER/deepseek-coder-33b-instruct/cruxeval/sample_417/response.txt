The function f takes a list lst as input. It first reverses the list, then removes the last element, and finally reverses the list again. The final list is returned as the output.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [7, 8, 2, 8], we need to follow the steps:
1. Reverse the list: [8, 2, 8, 7]
2. Remove the last element: [8, 2, 8]
3. Reverse the list again: [7, 8, 2]

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [7, 8, 2, 8] is [7, 8, 2].

<<<Output>>>
[7, 8, 2]
