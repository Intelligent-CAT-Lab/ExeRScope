The function f takes a list of strings as input. It then creates a copy of this list and iterates over each string in the list. For each string, it rotates the characters in the string by moving the first character to the end. This is done by slicing the string and concatenating the last character, the middle characters (excluding the first and last), and the first character. The rotated strings are then joined together to form a single string, which is the output of the function.

For the input `['__', '1', '.', '0', 'r0', '__', 'a_j', '6', '__', '6']`, the function first makes a copy of the list. Then it iterates over each string in the list. For each string, it rotates the characters by moving the first character to the end. The rotated strings are then joined together to form a single string.

The output of the function f on the input `['__', '1', '.', '0', 'r0', '__', 'a_j', '6', '__', '6']` is `'__.0r0__a_j6__61'`.
