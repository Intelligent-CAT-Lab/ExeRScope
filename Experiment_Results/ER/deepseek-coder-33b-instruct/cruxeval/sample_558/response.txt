The function f takes two lists as input: nums and mos. It first removes all occurrences of the numbers in mos from nums. Then it sorts nums in ascending order. After that, it appends the numbers in mos to nums. Finally, it checks if nums is sorted in ascending order. If it is, it returns True; otherwise, it returns False.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [3, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1] and [1], we need to follow the steps of the function.

1. Remove all occurrences of the numbers in mos from nums. In this case, we remove all occurrences of 1 from nums. This results in nums being [3, 2, 4, 1].
2. Sort nums in ascending order. This results in nums being [1, 2, 3, 4].
3. Append the numbers in mos to nums. In this case, we append 1 to nums. This results in nums being [1, 2, 3, 4, 1].
4. Check if nums is sorted in ascending order. It is, so the function returns True.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [3, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1] and [1] is True.
