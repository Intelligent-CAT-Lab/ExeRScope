The function f takes a string name as input. It splits the name into a list of words using the split() method, which splits the string at each space character. Then it joins the list of words into a string using the join() method, which concatenates the words with the '*' character in between.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'Fred Smith', we need to split 'Fred Smith' into 'Fred' and 'Smith', and then join them with '*' in between.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'Fred Smith' is 'Fred*Smith'.

<<<Output>>>
'Fred*Smith'
