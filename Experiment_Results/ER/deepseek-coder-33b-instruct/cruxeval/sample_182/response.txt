The function f takes a dictionary dic as input. It sorts the items of the dictionary based on the keys and returns the sorted list of tuples.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input {'b': 1, 'a': 2}, we need to sort the items of the dictionary based on the keys. The sorted function sorts the items in ascending order by default.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input {'b': 1, 'a': 2} is [('a', 2), ('b', 1)].

<<<Output>>>
[('a', 2), ('b', 1)]
