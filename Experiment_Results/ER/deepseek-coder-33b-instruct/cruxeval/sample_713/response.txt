The function f takes a string text and a character char as input. It checks if the character char is in the string text. If it is, it splits the string text into a list of substrings using the character char as the delimiter, strips leading and trailing whitespace from each substring, and removes any empty substrings. If the resulting list has more than one element, it returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'only one line' and ' ', we need to follow the steps outlined above.

1. The character ' ' is in the string 'only one line'.
2. The string is split into the substrings 'only', 'one', 'line'.
3. Leading and trailing whitespace is removed from each substring, resulting in 'only', 'one', 'line'.
4. The empty substring is removed, resulting in 'only', 'one', 'line'.
5. The list has more than one element, so the function returns True.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'only one line' and ' ' is True.
