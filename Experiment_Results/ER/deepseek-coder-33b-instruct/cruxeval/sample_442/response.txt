The function f takes a list lst as input. It initializes an empty list res. Then it iterates over the elements of lst. If an element is even, it is appended to res. Finally, it returns a copy of lst.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 2, 3, 4], we need to follow the steps of the function.

1. Initialize res as an empty list.
2. Iterate over the elements of lst.
3. If an element is even, append it to res.
4. Return a copy of lst.

Since the input list [1, 2, 3, 4] contains only odd numbers, res remains empty. Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 2, 3, 4] is [1, 2, 3, 4].

<<<Output>>>
[1, 2, 3, 4]
