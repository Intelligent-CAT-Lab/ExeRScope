The function f takes three parameters: a text string, an old string, and a new string.

First, it checks if the length of the old string is greater than 3. If it is, it returns the original text string.

Next, it checks if the old string is in the text string and if there is no space in the text string. If both conditions are true, it replaces the old string in the text string with the new string repeated the number of times equal to the length of the old string.

If the old string is not in the text string or there is a space in the text string, it enters a while loop. In this loop, it replaces the old string in the text string with the new string until the old string is no longer in the text string.

Finally, it returns the modified text string.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'avacado', 'va', '-', the function first checks if the length of 'va' is greater than 3. It is not, so it moves on to the next condition.

The condition checks if 'va' is in 'avacado' and if there is no space in 'avacado'. It is, so it replaces 'va' in 'avacado' with '-' repeated the number of times equal to the length of 'va', which is 2.

The modified text string is 'ava-co-do', which is then returned as the output.

<<<Output>>>
'ava-co-do'
