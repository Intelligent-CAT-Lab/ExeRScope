The function f takes a list of characters as input. It first creates a dictionary d from the input list no, where each key is a character from the list and the corresponding value is False. Then it calculates the sum of 1 for each key in the dictionary. The sum is the count of unique elements in the list.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input ['l', 'f', 'h', 'g', 's', 'b'], we need to count the number of unique characters in the list.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input ['l', 'f', 'h', 'g', 's', 'b'] is 6.

<<<Output>>>
6
