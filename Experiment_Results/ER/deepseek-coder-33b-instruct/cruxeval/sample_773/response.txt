The function f takes a list of numbers nums and an integer n as input. It removes the nth element from the list nums and returns it.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input ```([-7, 3, 1, -1, -1, 0, 4], 6)```, we need to remove the 6th element from the list. However, Python uses 0-based indexing, so the 6th element is actually the last element.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input ```([-7, 3, 1, -1, -1, 0, 4], 6)``` is 4.
