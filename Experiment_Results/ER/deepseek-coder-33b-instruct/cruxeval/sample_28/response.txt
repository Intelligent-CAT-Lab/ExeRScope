The function f takes a list mylist as input. It first makes a copy of the list using slicing (mylist[:]) and assigns it to revl. Then it reverses the list revl. After that, it sorts the original list mylist in descending order. Finally, it checks if the sorted list mylist is equal to the reversed list revl. If they are equal, it returns True, otherwise it returns False.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [5, 8], we need to follow the steps of the function.

1. First, it makes a copy of the list [5, 8] and assigns it to revl. So, revl is now [5, 8].
2. Then it reverses the list revl. So, revl is now [8, 5].
3. Next, it sorts the original list [5, 8] in descending order. So, the list [5, 8] is now [8, 5].
4. Finally, it checks if the sorted list [8, 5] is equal to the reversed list [8, 5]. Since they are equal, it returns True.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [5, 8] is True.
