The function f takes two inputs, k and j. It initializes an empty list arr. Then it enters a loop that runs k times. In each iteration of the loop, it appends the value of j to the list arr. Finally, it returns the list arr.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input (7, 5), we need to create a list with 7 elements, each of which is 5. Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input (7, 5) is [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5].

<<<Output>>>
[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]
