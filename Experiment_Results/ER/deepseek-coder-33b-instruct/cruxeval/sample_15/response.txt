The function f takes three parameters: a string text, a string wrong, and a string right. It first replaces all occurrences of the string wrong in the string text with the string right. Then it converts the resulting string to uppercase and returns it.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "zn kgd jw lnt", "h", and "u", we need to replace all occurrences of "h" in "zn kgd jw lnt" with "u", and then convert the resulting string to uppercase.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "zn kgd jw lnt", "h", and "u" is "ZN KGU JW LNT".

<<<Output>>>
'ZN KGU JW LNT'
