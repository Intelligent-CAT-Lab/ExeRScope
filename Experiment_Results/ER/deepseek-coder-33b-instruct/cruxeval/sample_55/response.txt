The function f takes an array as input. It initializes an empty array array_2. Then it iterates over each element in the input array. If the element is greater than 0, it adds the element to array_2. After the loop, it sorts array_2 in descending order and returns it.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [4, 8, 17, 89, 43, 14], we need to follow the steps of the function:

1. Initialize array_2 as an empty array.
2. Iterate over each element in the input array.
   - If the element is greater than 0, add it to array_2.
   - In this case, the elements that are greater than 0 are 4, 8, 17, 89, 43, and 14. So, array_2 becomes [4, 8, 17, 89, 43, 14].
3. Sort array_2 in descending order.
   - After sorting, array_2 becomes [89, 43, 17, 8, 4, 14].
4. Return array_2.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [4, 8, 17, 89, 43, 14] is [89, 43, 17, 8, 4, 14].

<<<Output>>>
[89, 43, 17, 8, 4, 14]
