The function f takes a string num and an integer l as input. It initializes an empty string t. Then it enters a while loop that continues until l is less than or equal to the length of num. In each iteration of the loop, it appends a '0' to t and decrements l by 1. Once the loop ends, it returns the concatenation of t and num.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "1" and 3, we need to follow the steps of the function.

1. Initialize t as an empty string.
2. Enter the while loop since 3 (l) is greater than 1 (length of num).
3. In the first iteration of the loop, append '0' to t and decrement l to 2.
4. In the second iteration of the loop, append '0' to t and decrement l to 1.
5. The loop ends since l is no longer greater than the length of num.
6. Return the concatenation of t and num, which is '00' + '1' = '001'.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "1" and 3 is '001'.

<<<Output>>>
