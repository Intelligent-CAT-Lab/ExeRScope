The function f takes two arguments: a string text and a string new_ending. It first converts the string text into a list of characters. Then it extends the list with the characters of the string new_ending. Finally, it joins all the characters in the list into a single string and returns it.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'jro' and 'wdlp', we need to follow the steps of the function:
1. Convert 'jro' into a list of characters: ['j', 'r', 'o']
2. Extend the list with the characters of 'wdlp': ['j', 'r', 'o', 'w', 'd', 'l', 'p']
3. Join all the characters in the list into a single string: 'jrowdlp'

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'jro' and 'wdlp' is 'jrowdlp'.

<<<Output>>>
'jrowdlp'
