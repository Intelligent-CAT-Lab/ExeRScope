The function f takes a string text, and two characters a and b as input. It first replaces all occurrences of character a in text with character b, and then replaces all occurrences of character b in the modified text with character a.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input ' vup a zwwo oihee amuwuuw! ', 'a', 'u', we need to follow the steps:
1. Replace all occurrences of 'a' in ' vup a zwwo oihee amuwuuw!' with 'u'. The result is ' vup u zwwo oihee umuwuuw! '.
2. Replace all occurrences of 'u' in the modified text with 'a'. The result is ' vup a zwwo oihee amaww! '.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input ' vup a zwwo oihee amuwuuw! ', 'a', 'u' is ' vup a zwwo oihee amaww! '.

<<<Output>>>
' vup a zwwo oihee amaww! '
