The function f takes a list of numbers nums, an index idx, and a number added as input. It inserts the number added at the index idx in the list nums.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [2, 2, 2, 3, 3], 2, 3, we need to insert 3 at index 2 in the list [2, 2, 2, 3, 3].

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [2, 2, 2, 3, 3], 2, 3 is [2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3, 3].

<<<Output>>>
[2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3, 3]
