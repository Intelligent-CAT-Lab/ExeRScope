The function f takes a string text as input. It splits the text into words and then for each word, it replaces the occurrences of '-word' and 'word-' with a space. Finally, it removes any leading or trailing '-' from the text and returns the result.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input '-stew---corn-and-beans-in soup-.-', we need to follow the steps of the function:

1. Split the input string into words: ['-stew---corn-and-beans-in', 'soup-.-']
2. For each word, replace '-stew' and 'stew-', '-corn' and 'corn-', '-and' and 'and-', '-beans' and 'beans-', '-in' and 'in-', '-soup' and 'soup-' with a space.
3. After the first iteration, the string becomes '- stew---corn-and-beans-in soup-.-'. After the second iteration, the string becomes '- stew---corn-and-beans-in soup-.-'.
4. Strip any leading or trailing '-' from the string.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input '-stew---corn-and-beans-in soup-.-' is 'stew corn and beans in soup'.

<<<Output>>>
'stew corn and beans in soup'
