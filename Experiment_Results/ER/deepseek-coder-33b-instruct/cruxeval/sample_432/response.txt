The function f takes two parameters: length and text. It first checks if the length of the text is equal to the provided length. If they are equal, it reverses the text and returns it. If they are not equal, it returns False.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input -5, 'G5ogb6f,c7e.EMm', we need to compare the length of the text 'G5ogb6f,c7e.EMm' with -5. Since they are not equal, the function returns False.

<<<Output>>>
False
