The function f takes a string text and a string characters as input. It iterates over the characters in the string characters. For each character, it removes all occurrences of that character from the end of the string text. The function then returns the modified string text.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "r;r;r;r;r;r;r;r;r" and "x.r", we need to remove all occurrences of the characters 'x' and '.' from the end of the string "r;r;r;r;r;r;r;r;r". However, since there are no 'x' or '.' at the end of the string, the string remains unchanged.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "r;r;r;r;r;r;r;r;r" and "x.r" is "r;r;r;r;r;r;r;r;r".

<<<Output>>>
'r;r;r;r;r;r;r;r;r'
