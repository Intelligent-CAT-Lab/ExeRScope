The function f takes a string text as input. It splits the text into an array of words using the split() function. Then it initializes an empty list result. For each word in the array, it checks if the word ends with 'day'. If it does, it appends 'y' to the word. If it doesn't, it appends 'day' to the word. Finally, it joins all the words in the result list into a string with a space in between each word using the join() function and returns this string.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "nwv mef ofme bdryl", we need to follow the steps of the function.

1. Split the input string into an array of words: ["nwv", "mef", "ofme", "bdryl"]
2. For each word in the array, check if it ends with 'day'.
   - "nwv" doesn't end with 'day', so append 'day' to it. The result is "nwvday".
   - "mef" doesn't end with 'day', so append 'day' to it. The result is "mefday".
   - "ofme" doesn't end with 'day', so append 'day' to it. The result is "ofmeday".
   - "bdryl" ends with 'day', so append 'y' to it. The result is "bdryly".
3. Join all the words in the result list into a string with a space in between each word: "nwvday mefday ofmeday bdryly".

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "nwv mef ofme bdryl" is "nwvday mefday ofmeday bdryly".

<<<Output>>>
'nwvday mefday ofmeday bdryly'
