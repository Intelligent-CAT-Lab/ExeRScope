The function f takes two strings as input: text and to_place. It first finds the index of the first occurrence of to_place in text, and then splits text into two parts: after_place and before_place. The after_place is the part of text that comes before the first occurrence of to_place, and the before_place is the part of text that comes after the first occurrence of to_place. Finally, it returns the concatenation of after_place and before_place.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'some text' and 'some', we need to find the first occurrence of 'some' in 'some text', which is at index 0. Then we split 'some text' into two parts: 'some' and ' text'. The after_place is 'some', and the before_place is ' text'. Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'some text' and 'some' is 'some text'.

<<<Output>>>
'some text'
