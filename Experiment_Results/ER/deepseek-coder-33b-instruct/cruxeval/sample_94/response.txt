The function f takes two dictionaries a and b as input and returns a new dictionary that combines the key-value pairs of a and b. If there are any duplicate keys, the value from b will overwrite the value from a.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input {'w': 5, 'wi': 10} and {'w': 3}, we need to combine the two dictionaries. The key 'w' is present in both dictionaries, so the value from the second dictionary (3) will overwrite the value from the first dictionary (5).

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input {'w': 5, 'wi': 10} and {'w': 3} is {'w': 3, 'wi': 10}.

<<<Output>>>
{'w': 3, 'wi': 10}
