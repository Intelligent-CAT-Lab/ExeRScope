The function f takes a string text as input. It splits the string into a list of substrings at each occurrence of ':'. It then selects the first substring from the list (at index 0) and counts the number of '#' characters in this substring.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "#! : #!", we need to follow the steps:
1. Split the string "#! : #!" into a list of substrings at each occurrence of ':'. This results in the list ["#! ", " "].
2. Select the first substring from the list (at index 0). This results in the string "#! ".
3. Count the number of '#' characters in this substring. This results in 2.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "#! : #!" is 2.
