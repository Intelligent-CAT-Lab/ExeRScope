The function f takes a list of numbers nums and a number delete as input. It removes the first occurrence of delete from the list nums and then returns the modified list.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [4, 5, 3, 6, 1] and 5, we need to remove the first occurrence of 5 from the list [4, 5, 3, 6, 1]. Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [4, 5, 3, 6, 1] and 5 is [4, 3, 6, 1].

<<<Output>>>
[4, 3, 6, 1]
