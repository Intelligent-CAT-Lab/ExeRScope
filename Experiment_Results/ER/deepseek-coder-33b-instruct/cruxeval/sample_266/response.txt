The function f takes a list of integers nums as input. It iterates over the list in reverse order (from the last element to the first). For each element, it checks if the element is odd. If the element is odd, it inserts the element at the position next to the current position.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [2, 3, 4, 6, -2], we need to follow the steps of the function.

1. The last element of the list is -2, which is not odd. So, no insertion is performed.
2. The next element is 6, which is even. So, no insertion is performed.
3. The next element is 4, which is even. So, no insertion is performed.
4. The next element is 3, which is odd. So, 3 is inserted at the position next to 4, resulting in the list [2, 3, 4, 3, 6, -2].
5. The next element is 2, which is even. So, no insertion is performed.
6. The first element of the list is 2, which is even. So, no insertion is performed.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [2, 3, 4, 6, -2] is [2, 3, 4, 3, 6, -2].

<<<Output>>>
[2, 3, 4, 3, 6, -2]
