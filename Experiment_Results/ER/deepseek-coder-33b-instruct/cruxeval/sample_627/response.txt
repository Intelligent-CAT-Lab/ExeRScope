The function f takes a list of tuples as input. It first converts the list of tuples into a dictionary, where the first element of each tuple is the key and the second element is the value. Then it returns a list of all the values in the dictionary.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [('u', 1), ('s', 7), ('u', -5)], we need to convert the list of tuples into a dictionary and then get all the values from the dictionary.

The dictionary would look like this: {'u': -5, 's': 7}. The values of the dictionary are [1, 7, -5].

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [('u', 1), ('s', 7), ('u', -5)] is [1, 7, -5].

<<<Output>>>
[1, 7, -5]
