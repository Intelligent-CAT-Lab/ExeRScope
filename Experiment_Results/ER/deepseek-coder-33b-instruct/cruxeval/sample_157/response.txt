The function f takes a string phrase as input. It splits the phrase into words using the split() function, which splits the string at each space character. Then it iterates over each word in the phrase. For each word, it iterates over each character in the word. If the character is "0", it increments the variable ans by 1. Finally, it returns the value of ans.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "aboba 212 has 0 digits", we need to count the number of "0" characters in the phrase. The phrase has one "0" character, so the output of executing the function f on the input "aboba 212 has 0 digits" is 1.
