The function f takes a string txt as input. It uses the format method of the string txt to format the string with the tuple ('0'*20,). The format method replaces the placeholders in the string with the values in the tuple. Since there are no placeholders in the string, the format method does not change the string. Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "5123807309875480094949830" is the same string "5123807309875480094949830".

<<<Output>>>
'5123807309875480094949830'
