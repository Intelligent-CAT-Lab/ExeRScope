The function f takes a string s as input. It first removes the leading and trailing spaces from s using the strip() method. Then it converts the string into a list of characters using the list() function. It reverses the list using the reverse() method and finally joins the characters in the list to form a string using the join() method.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input '   OOP   ', we need to follow the steps mentioned above.

1. The strip() method removes the leading and trailing spaces from '   OOP   ', resulting in 'OOP'.
2. The list() function converts 'OOP' into a list of characters ['O', 'O', 'P'].
3. The reverse() method reverses the list to ['P', 'O', 'O'].
4. The join() method concatenates the characters in the list to form a string, resulting in 'POO'.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input '   OOP   ' is 'POO'.

<<<Output>>>
'POO'
