The function f takes a list of items and an item as input. It removes the last item from the list if it is equal to the input item, then appends the input item to the list and finally returns the length of the list.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'bfreratrrbdbzagbretaredtroefcoiqrrneaosf'.split('-') and 'n', we need to follow the steps of the function:

1. The input string 'bfreratrrbdbzagbretaredtroefcoiqrrneaosf' is split into a list of characters using '-' as the delimiter.
2. The function f is then called with this list and the character 'n' as arguments.
3. The function enters a while loop that continues as long as the last item in the list is equal to 'n'.
4. In each iteration of the loop, the last item in the list is removed.
5. Once the last item in the list is not equal to 'n', 'n' is appended to the list.
6. The function then returns the length of the list.

Based on these steps, the output of executing the function f on the input 'bfreratrrbdbzagbretaredtroefcoiqrrneaosf'.split('-') and 'n' is 50.
