The function f takes a string of tokens as input. It splits the input string into a list of tokens. If the length of the list is 2, it reverses the list. Then it joins the first and second elements of the list with a space, and pads each element with spaces on the right to make them 5 characters long. The final result is returned.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'gsd avdropj', we need to follow the steps of the function.

1. The input string 'gsd avdropj' is split into the list ['gsd', 'avdropj'].
2. The length of the list is 2, so the list is reversed to ['avdropj', 'gsd'].
3. The first and second elements of the reversed list are joined with a space, and each element is padded with spaces on the right to make them 5 characters long. The result is 'avdropj gsd  '.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'gsd avdropj' is 'avdropj gsd  '.

<<<Output>>>
'avdropj gsd  '
