The function f takes a list of numbers nums, a starting index start, and a number k as input. It reverses the sublist of nums starting at index start and of length k, and then returns the modified list.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], 4, 2, we need to reverse the sublist of nums starting at index 4 and of length 2. The sublist is [5, 6], and reversing it gives [6, 5]. Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], 4, 2 is [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 5].

<<<Output>>>
[1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 5]
