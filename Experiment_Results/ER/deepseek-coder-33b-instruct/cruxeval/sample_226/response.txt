The function f takes a list of numbers as input. It iterates over the list using a for loop and checks if each number is divisible by 3. If a number is divisible by 3, it is appended to the list. The function then returns the modified list.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 3], we need to follow the steps of the function:
1. The first number in the list is 1. It is not divisible by 3, so nothing happens.
2. The second number in the list is 3. It is divisible by 3, so it is appended to the list.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 3] is [1, 3, 3].

<<<Output>>>
[1, 3, 3]
