The function f takes a list of numbers as input. It initializes an empty list output. For each number n in the input list nums, it appends a tuple to the output list. The tuple consists of the count of n in the list nums and n itself. After going through all the numbers in the list, it sorts the output list in descending order. Finally, it returns the sorted output list.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1], we need to follow the steps of the function.

1. For the first number 1, it counts how many times 1 appears in the list, which is 4. So, it appends the tuple (4, 1) to the output list.
2. For the next number 3, it counts how many times 3 appears in the list, which is 2. So, it appends the tuple (2, 3) to the output list.
3. For the last number 1, it counts how many times 1 appears in the list, which is 4. But since we have already counted this number, it does not append the tuple (4, 1) to the output list.
4. After going through all the numbers in the list, it sorts the output list in descending order based on the first element of each tuple.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1] is [(4, 1), (2, 3)].

<<<Output>>>
[(4, 1), (2, 3)]
