The function f takes two dictionaries as input. It first makes a copy of the first dictionary and then updates this copy with the key-value pairs from the second dictionary. The update method is used with a list comprehension to iterate over the items in the second dictionary and add them to the copy.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input ```{'disface': 9, 'cam': 7}``` and ```{'mforce': 5}```, we need to follow the steps outlined above.

First, a copy of the first dictionary is made. This copy is ```{'disface': 9, 'cam': 7}```.

Next, the update method is called on this copy. The update method adds the key-value pairs from the second dictionary to the copy. In this case, the second dictionary only has one key-value pair: ```'mforce': 5```.

So, the updated copy becomes ```{'disface': 9, 'cam': 7, 'mforce': 5}```.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input ```{'disface': 9, 'cam': 7}``` and ```{'mforce': 5}``` is ```{'disface': 9, 'cam': 7, 'mforce': 5}```.

<<<Output>>>
{'disface': 9, 'cam': 7, 'mforce': 5}
