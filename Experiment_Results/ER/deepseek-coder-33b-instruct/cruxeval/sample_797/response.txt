The function f takes a dictionary dct as input. It creates an empty list lst. Then it iterates over the keys of the dictionary in sorted order. For each key, it appends a tuple containing the key and the corresponding value from the dictionary to the list lst. Finally, it returns the list lst.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}, we need to follow the steps of the function.

1. The function starts by creating an empty list lst.
2. It then sorts the keys of the dictionary in ascending order, which are 'a', 'b', and 'c'.
3. It then iterates over each key in the sorted order. For the key 'a', it appends the tuple ('a', 1) to the list lst. For the key 'b', it appends the tuple ('b', 2) to the list lst. For the key 'c', it appends the tuple ('c', 3) to the list lst.
4. Finally, it returns the list lst, which is [('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3)].

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3} is [('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3)].

<<<Output>>>
[('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3)]
