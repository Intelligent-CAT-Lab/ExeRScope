The function f takes a dictionary dic and a value as input. It initializes an empty list result. Then it iterates over each key-value pair in the dictionary. For each pair, it appends the key to the result list. If the value of the pair equals the input value, it reverses the result list. Otherwise, it appends the value to the result list. Finally, it returns the result list.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input ```{'9m':2, 'mA':1, '10K':2, 'Lk':2}``` and 1, we need to follow the steps of the function.

1. Initialize result as an empty list.
2. Iterate over the dictionary. The first pair is '9m':2. Append '9m' to the result list. Since 2 is not equal to 1, append 2 to the result list.
3. The next pair is 'mA':1. Append 'mA' to the result list. Since 1 is equal to 1, reverse the result list.
4. The next pair is '10K':2. Append '10K' to the result list. Since 2 is not equal to 1, append 2 to the result list.
5. The last pair is 'Lk':2. Append 'Lk' to the result list. Since 2 is not equal to 1, append 2 to the result list.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input ```{'9m':2, 'mA':1, '10K':2, 'Lk':2}``` and 1 is ['Lk', 2, '10K', 2, 'mA', '9m', 2].

<<<Output>>>
['Lk', 2, '10K', 2, 'mA', '9m', 2]
