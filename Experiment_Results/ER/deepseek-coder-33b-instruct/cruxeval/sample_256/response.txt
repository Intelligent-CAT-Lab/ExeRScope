The function f takes two parameters: text and sub. It initializes two variables a and b to the first and last indices of the text respectively. Then it enters a while loop that continues until a is greater than b.

In each iteration of the loop, it calculates the middle index c of the text. If the last occurrence of the substring sub in the text is greater than or equal to c, it moves a to the right of c. Otherwise, it moves b to the left of c.

The function then returns the value of a.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'dorfunctions' and '2', we need to follow the steps of the function.

First, a is 0 and b is 10 (length of 'dorfunctions' - 1).

Then, c is 5 (the middle index). The last occurrence of '2' in 'dorfunctions' is at index 1, which is less than c. So, b is moved to the left of c, becoming 4.

Next, c is recalculated as 2 (the new middle index). The last occurrence of '2' in 'dorfunctions' is at index 1, which is less than c. So, b is moved to the left of c, becoming 1.

Next, c is recalculated as 1 (the new middle index). The last occurrence of '2' in 'dorfunctions' is at index 1, which is equal to c. So, a is moved to the right of c, becoming 2.

Finally, c is recalculated as 1 (the new middle index). The last occurrence of '2' in 'dorfunctions' is at index 1, which is equal to c. So, a is moved to the right of c, becoming 2.

The loop ends because a is no longer less than or equal to b.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'dorfunctions' and '2' is 2.
