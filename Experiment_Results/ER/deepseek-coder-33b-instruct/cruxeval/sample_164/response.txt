The function f takes a list lst as input. It sorts the list in ascending order and then returns the first three elements of the sorted list.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [5, 8, 1, 3, 0], we first sort the list in ascending order, which gives us [0, 1, 3, 5, 8]. Then we return the first three elements of the sorted list, which are [0, 1, 3].
<<<Output>>>
[0, 1, 3]
