The function f takes a list of names and a string excluded as input. It replaces the excluded string in each name in the list. If the excluded string is empty, it will not change the names.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input ```f(["avc  a .d e"], "")```, we need to replace the empty string in each name in the list with nothing. Since the excluded string is empty, it will not change the names.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input ```f(["avc  a .d e"], "")``` is ```["avc  a .d e"]```.

<<<Output>>>
['avc  a .d e']
