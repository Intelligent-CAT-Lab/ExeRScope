The function f takes three arguments: a string text, a character char, and a string replace. It uses the replace method of the string class to replace all occurrences of char in text with replace.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'a1a8', '1', 'n2', we need to replace all occurrences of '1' in 'a1a8' with 'n2'. Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'a1a8', '1', 'n2' is 'an2a8'.

<<<Output>>>
'an2a8'
