The function f takes two arguments: a string forest and an animal. It first finds the index of the animal in the forest string. Then it converts the forest string into a list of characters. It then enters a while loop where it replaces each character in the list with the next character in the list. If the index is equal to the length of the forest minus one, it replaces the last character with a hyphen. Finally, it joins the list back into a string and returns it.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input '2imo 12 tfiqr.' and 'm', we need to follow the steps of the function.

1. The index of 'm' in '2imo 12 tfiqr.' is 3.
2. The list of characters in '2imo 12 tfiqr.' is ['2', 'i', 'm', 'o', ' ', '1', '2', ' ', 't', 'f', 'i', 'q', 'r', '.'].
3. The while loop replaces each character with the next character, starting from the index of 'm'. The list becomes ['2', 'i', 'o', ' ', '1', '2', ' ', 't', 'f', 'i', 'q', 'r', '.', '-'].
4. The last character is replaced with a hyphen.
5. The list is joined back into a string, resulting in '2i o 12 tfiqr.-'.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input '2imo 12 tfiqr.' and 'm' is '2i o 12 tfiqr.-'.

<<<Output>>>
'2i o 12 tfiqr.-'
