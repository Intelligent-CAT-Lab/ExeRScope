The function f takes an array as input. It initializes an empty list result and an index variable to 0. Then it enters a while loop that continues until the index is less than the length of the array.

In each iteration of the loop, it removes the last element from the array using the pop() method and appends it to the result list. It then increments the index by 2.

The while loop will remove and append every second element from the array to the result list, starting from the end of the array.

When the function is called with the input [8, 8, -4, -9, 2, 8, -1, 8], it will remove and append the elements at indices 0, 2, 4, and 6 (the last, third last, second last, and third last elements) to the result list. The result list will be [8, 2, -1, 8].

The function then returns the result list.

<<<Output>>>
[8, 2, -1, 8]
