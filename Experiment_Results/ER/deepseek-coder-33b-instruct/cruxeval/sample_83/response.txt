The function f takes a string text as input. It uses the rpartition method to split the string into three parts at the last occurrence of '0'. The rpartition method splits the string from the right side. If '0' is not found, it returns a tuple containing two empty strings and the original string.

In the case of 'qq0tt', the rpartition method splits the string into three parts: 'qq', '0', and 'tt'. The first part 'qq' is assigned to l[0], the second part '0' is assigned to l[1], and the third part 'tt' is assigned to l[2].

The function then checks if the third part (l[2]) is an empty string. If it is, it returns '-1:-1'. If it's not, it calculates the length of the first part (l[0]) and finds the position of '0' in the third part (l[2]). The position is found using the find method, which returns the index of the first occurrence of '0'. Since Python uses 0-based indexing, we add 1 to the position to get the position in 1-based indexing.

Finally, the function returns a formatted string that includes the length of the first part and the position of '0' in the third part.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'qq0tt' is '2:1'.

<<<Output>>>
'2:1'
