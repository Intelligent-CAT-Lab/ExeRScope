The function f takes a list of strings as input. It initializes an empty list ls. Then it iterates over each string in the input list. For each string, it splits the string into lines using the splitlines() method and appends the resulting list of lines to the list ls. Finally, it returns the list ls.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input ['Hello World\n"I am String"'], we need to follow the steps of the function:

1. Initialize an empty list ls.
2. Iterate over each string in the input list.
3. For the first string 'Hello World\n"I am String"', split it into lines. The result is ['Hello World', '"I am String"'].
4. Append the list of lines to the list ls.
5. Return the list ls.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input ['Hello World\n"I am String"'] is [['Hello World'], ['"I am String"']].

<<<Output>>>
[['Hello World'], ['"I am String"']]
