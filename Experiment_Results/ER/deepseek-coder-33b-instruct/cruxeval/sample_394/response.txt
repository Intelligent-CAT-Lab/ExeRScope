The function f takes a string text as input. It splits the text into lines using the splitlines() method, which returns a list of lines. It then initializes a counter i to 0. It then iterates over each line in the list. If a line is empty (i.e., its length is 0), it returns the current value of i. If it goes through all the lines without finding an empty one, it returns -1.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "2 m2 \n\nbike", we need to follow the steps of the function.

1. The input "2 m2 \n\nbike" is split into lines: ["2 m2 ", "", "bike"].
2. The counter i is initialized to 0.
3. The function checks the first line "2 m2 ". It is not empty, so i is incremented to 1.
4. The function checks the second line "". It is empty, so it returns the current value of i, which is 1.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "2 m2 \n\nbike" is 1.
