The function f takes a dictionary graph as input. It creates a new dictionary new_graph and for each key-value pair in the input graph, it adds a new key-value pair to new_graph. The new key is the same as the old key, and the new value is an empty dictionary.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input {}, we need to follow the steps of the function.

1. Initialize new_graph as an empty dictionary.
2. Iterate over each key-value pair in the input graph. Since the input graph is empty, this loop does not execute.
3. Return new_graph.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input {} is {}.

<<<Output>>>
