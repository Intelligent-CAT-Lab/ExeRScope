The function f takes an integer n as input. It converts the integer n into a string using the str() function. Then it iterates over each character in the string. If the character is not a digit, it sets n to -1 and breaks the loop. Finally, it returns the value of n.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "6 ** 2", we need to follow the steps of the function. First, it converts "6 ** 2" into a string, which results in "6 ** 2". Then it iterates over each character in the string. The character " " (space) is not a digit, so it sets n to -1 and breaks the loop. Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "6 ** 2" is -1.

<<<Output>>>
-1
