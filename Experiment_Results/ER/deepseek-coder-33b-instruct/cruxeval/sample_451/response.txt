The function f takes a string text and a character char as input. It converts the string into a list of characters. Then it iterates over the list. If it finds the character char in the list, it removes the character from the list and returns the remaining characters as a string. If it doesn't find the character char in the list, it returns the original list as a string.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'pn' and 'p', we need to follow the steps in the function.

1. Convert 'pn' into a list ['p', 'n'].
2. Iterate over the list.
3. The first item is 'p', which is equal to 'p'. So, remove 'p' from the list.
4. The list becomes ['n'].
5. Return the list as a string 'n'.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'pn' and 'p' is 'n'.

<<<Output>>>
'n'
