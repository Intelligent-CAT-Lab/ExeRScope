The function f takes two strings as input: text and insert. It initializes an empty string clean and a set of whitespace characters. It then iterates over each character in the text string. If the character is a whitespace character, it appends the insert string to clean. If the character is not a whitespace character, it appends the character itself to clean. Finally, it returns the string clean.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'pi wa' and 'chi', we need to iterate over each character in 'pi wa'. If the character is a whitespace character, we append 'chi' to clean. If the character is not a whitespace character, we append the character itself to clean.

The characters in 'pi wa' are 'p', 'i', ' ', 'w', and 'a'. The whitespace character is ' '. So, for each whitespace character, we append 'chi' to clean. The output of executing the function f on the input 'pi wa' and 'chi' is 'pichichiwa'.

<<<Output>>>
'pichichiwa'
