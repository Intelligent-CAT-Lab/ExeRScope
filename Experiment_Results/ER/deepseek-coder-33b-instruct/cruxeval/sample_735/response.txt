The function f takes a string sentence as input. If the sentence is empty, it returns an empty string. Otherwise, it removes all parentheses from the sentence, capitalizes the first character of the sentence, and removes all spaces from the sentence.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input '(A (b B))', we need to follow the steps outlined above.

1. The input '(A (b B))' is not an empty string, so we proceed to the next steps.
2. The function removes all parentheses from the sentence, resulting in 'A b B'.
3. The function capitalizes the first character of the sentence, resulting in 'A b b'.
4. The function removes all spaces from the sentence, resulting in 'Abb'.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input '(A (b B))' is 'Abb'.

<<<Output>>>
'Abb'
