The function f takes a string s as input and creates an empty list r. It then iterates over the string s in reverse order (from the last character to the first character). For each character, it appends it to the list r. Finally, it joins all the characters in the list r into a single string and returns it.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'crew', we need to follow the steps of the function:
1. The string 'crew' has 4 characters, so the range of the for loop is from 3 to 0 (inclusive).
2. The loop iterates over the string 'crew' in reverse order, appending each character to the list r.
3. The list r becomes ['w', 'e', 'r', 'c'].
4. The function then joins all the characters in the list r into a single string, resulting in 'werc'.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'crew' is 'werc'.

<<<Output>>>
'werc'
