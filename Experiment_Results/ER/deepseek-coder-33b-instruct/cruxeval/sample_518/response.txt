The function f takes a string text as input. It uses the isdecimal() method of the string class, which checks if all the characters in the string are decimal characters (i.e., numbers). The not operator is used to reverse the result of the isdecimal() method. Therefore, the function f returns True if the string text contains any non-decimal characters and False otherwise.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'the speed is -36 miles per hour', we need to check if the string contains any non-decimal characters. The string 'the speed is -36 miles per hour' contains a space, a dash, and the word 'miles', which are non-decimal characters. Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'the speed is -36 miles per hour' is True.

<<<Output>>>
