The function f takes a string text as input. It first removes any leading or trailing whitespace from the string using the strip() method and then splits the string into a list of words using the split(' ') method.

Next, it iterates over the list of words. For each word, it checks if the word is a digit using the isdigit() method. If the word is not a digit, it immediately returns the string '-'.

If the function has not returned '-' after checking all words, it joins the list of words back into a string using the join() method and returns this string.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "d khqw whi fwi bbn 41", we need to follow the steps outlined above.

First, the function removes any leading or trailing whitespace from the string, resulting in the string "d khqw whi fwi bbn 41".

Next, the function splits the string into a list of words, resulting in the list ['d', 'khqw', 'whi', 'fwi', 'bbn', '41'].

The function then iterates over the list of words. For each word, it checks if the word is a digit. In this case, all words are not digits, so the function does not return '-'.

Finally, the function joins the list of words back into a string using the join() method, resulting in the string "d khqw whi fwi bbn 41".

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "d khqw whi fwi bbn 41" is "d khqw whi fwi bbn 41".

<<<Output>>>
'd khqw whi fwi bbn 41'
