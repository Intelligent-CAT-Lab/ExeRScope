The function f takes a string mess and a character char as input. It removes all occurrences of char from mess, starting from the last occurrence of char and going backward.

For the input '0aabbaa0b' and 'a', the function first finds the last occurrence of 'a' in mess, which is at index 7. It then removes 'a' from mess from index 7 to the end.

Next, it finds the last occurrence of 'a' in the updated mess, which is at index 4. It then removes 'a' from mess from index 4 to the end.

Finally, it finds the last occurrence of 'a' in the updated mess, which is at index 1. It then removes 'a' from mess from index 1 to the end.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input '0aabbaa0b' and 'a' is '0bb0b'.

<<<Output>>>
'0bb0b'
