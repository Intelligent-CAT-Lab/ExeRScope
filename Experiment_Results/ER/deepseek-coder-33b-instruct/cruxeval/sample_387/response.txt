The function f takes a list of numbers nums, a position pos, and a value as input. It inserts the value at the specified position in the list and then returns the modified list.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [3, 1, 2], 2, 0, we need to insert 0 at the position 2 in the list [3, 1, 2]. The list after insertion becomes [3, 1, 0, 2].

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [3, 1, 2], 2, 0 is [3, 1, 0, 2].

<<<Output>>>
[3, 1, 0, 2]
