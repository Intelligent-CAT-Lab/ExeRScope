The function f takes a list lst as input. It then slices the list from the second element to the fourth element (index 1 to 3) and reverses it. This reversed slice is then assigned back to the list from the second element to the fourth element. The function finally returns the modified list.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 2, 3], we need to follow the steps of the function. The sliced list from the second element to the fourth element (index 1 to 3) is [2, 3]. Reversing this list gives [3, 2]. Then, this reversed list is assigned back to the list from the second element to the fourth element. The final list becomes [1, 3, 2].

<<<Output>>>
[1, 3, 2]
