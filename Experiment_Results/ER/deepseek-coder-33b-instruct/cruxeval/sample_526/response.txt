The function f takes four parameters: label1, char, label2, and index.

1. The function first finds the last occurrence of the character char in the string label1 using the rindex() method. This method returns the highest index of the character in the string.

2. If the index of the last occurrence of the character in label1 is greater than or equal to the index parameter, the function returns a substring of label2 from the beginning to the index of the last occurrence of the character in label1 minus the index parameter plus one.

3. If the index of the last occurrence of the character in label1 is less than the index parameter, the function returns the concatenation of label1 and a substring of label2 from the index of the last occurrence of the character in label1 minus the index parameter in label2.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'ekwies', 's', 'rpg', 1, we need to follow the steps above.

1. The last occurrence of 's' in 'ekwies' is at index 4.
2. Since 4 is greater than 1, the function returns a substring of 'rpg' from the beginning to the index 4 minus 1 plus one, which is 'r'.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'ekwies', 's', 'rpg', 1 is 'r'.

<<<Output>>>
'r'
