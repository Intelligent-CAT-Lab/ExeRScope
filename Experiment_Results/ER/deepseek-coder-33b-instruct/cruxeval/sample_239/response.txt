The function f takes a string text and a string froms as input. It first removes the leading and trailing characters that are present in froms from text using the lstrip and rstrip methods. The lstrip method removes the leading characters and the rstrip method removes the trailing characters.

In the given example, the input is '0 t 1cos ' and 'st ' + '0\t\n  '. The lstrip method removes the leading '0' and the rstrip method removes the trailing ' ' and '\t\n  '.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input '0 t 1cos ' and 'st ' + '0\t\n  ' is ' t 1cos'.

<<<Output>>>
' t 1cos'
