The function f takes an integer num as input. It initializes a list initial with a single element 1. Then it creates a copy of initial and assigns it to total.

In the for loop, for each iteration, it creates a new list total by prepending 1 to the list of sums of adjacent elements in total. It then appends the last element of total to initial.

After the loop finishes, it returns the sum of all elements in initial.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 3, we need to follow the steps of the function.

1. Initialization: initial = [1], total = [1]
2. First iteration: total = [1, 1+1] = [1, 2], initial = [1, 2]
3. Second iteration: total = [1, 1+2, 2+1] = [1, 3, 2], initial = [1, 2, 3]
4. Third iteration: total = [1, 1+3, 3+2, 2+1] = [1, 4, 5, 2], initial = [1, 2, 3, 5]
5. Return sum of initial: 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 = 11

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 3 is 11.
