The function f takes a string st as input. It initializes an empty string swapped. Then it iterates over the characters in the reversed string st. For each character, it swaps its case (lowercase to uppercase, and vice versa) and appends it to swapped. Finally, it returns swapped.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'RTiGM', we need to reverse the string 'RTiGM' and swap the case of each character. Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'RTiGM' is 'mgirt'.

<<<Output>>>
'mgirt'
