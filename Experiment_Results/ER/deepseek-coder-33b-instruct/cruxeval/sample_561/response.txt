The function f takes a string text and a digit as input. It first counts the number of times the digit appears in the text. Then it multiplies the digit (converted to an integer) with the count and returns the result.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input '7Ljnw4Lj' and '7', we need to count the number of times '7' appears in '7Ljnw4Lj'. There is one '7' in '7Ljnw4Lj'. Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input '7Ljnw4Lj' and '7' is 7 * 1 = 7.

<<<Output>>>
7
