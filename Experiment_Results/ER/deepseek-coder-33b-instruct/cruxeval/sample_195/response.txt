The function f takes a string text as input. It then iterates over the list ['acs', 'asp', 'scn'] and for each prefix in the list, it removes the prefix from the text if it exists. After removing all the prefixes, it removes the leading space and the trailing space and returns the result.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'ilfdoirwirmtoibsac', we need to follow the steps in the function.

1. The first prefix 'acs' is not found in 'ilfdoirwirmtoibsac', so the text remains the same.
2. The second prefix 'asp' is not found in 'ilfdoirwirmtoibsac', so the text remains the same.
3. The third prefix 'scn' is found in 'ilfdoirwirmtoibsac', so 'ilfdoirwirmtoibsac' becomes 'ilfdoirwirmtoibsac'.
4. After removing the leading space, 'ilfdoirwirmtoibsac' becomes 'ilfdoirwirmtoibsac'.
5. After removing the trailing space, 'ilfdoirwirmtoibsac' becomes 'ilfdoirwirmtoibsac'.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'ilfdoirwirmtoibsac' is 'ilfdoirwirmtoibsac'.

<<<Output>>>
'ilfdoirwirmtoibsac'
