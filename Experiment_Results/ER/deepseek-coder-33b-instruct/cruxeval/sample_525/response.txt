The function f takes a dictionary c, a start value st, and an end value ed as input. It creates an empty dictionary d, and two variables a and b, both initialized to 0. It then iterates over the items in the dictionary c. For each item, it adds an entry to the dictionary d with the value as the key and the key as the value. If the value is equal to the start value st, it sets a to the key. If the value is equal to the end value ed, it sets b to the key. After the loop, it sets w to the value in the dictionary d corresponding to the start value st. It then returns a tuple with w and b if a is greater than b, otherwise it returns a tuple with b and w.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input ```({'TEXT': 7, 'CODE': 3}, 7, 3)```, we need to follow the steps of the function.

First, the function creates an empty dictionary d.
Next, it iterates over the items in the dictionary c. For each item, it adds an entry to the dictionary d with the value as the key and the key as the value.
In this case, the dictionary d becomes {'7': 'TEXT', '3': 'CODE'}.
Then, it checks if the value is equal to the start value st and end value ed. In this case, both are 7, so a and b are set to 'TEXT'.
Finally, it sets w to the value in the dictionary d corresponding to the start value st, which is 'TEXT'.

The function then returns a tuple with w and b if a is greater than b, otherwise it returns a tuple with b and w. In this case, a and b are both 'TEXT', so the function returns ('TEXT', 'TEXT').

<<<Output>>>
('TEXT', 'TEXT')
