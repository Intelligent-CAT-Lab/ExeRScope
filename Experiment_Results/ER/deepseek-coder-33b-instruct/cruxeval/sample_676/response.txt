The function f takes a string text and an integer tab_size as input. It replaces all the tab characters ('\t') in the string text with a number of spaces equal to tab_size.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'a' and 100, we need to replace the tab character in the string 'a' with 100 spaces. However, there are no tab characters in the string 'a', so the string remains the same.

<<<Output>>>
'a'
