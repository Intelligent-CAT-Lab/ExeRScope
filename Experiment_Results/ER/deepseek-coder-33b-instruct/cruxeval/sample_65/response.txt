The function f takes a list of numbers nums and an index as input. It first retrieves the number at the given index from the list, calculates the modulus of that number with 42, and then removes the number from the list. After that, it multiplies the removed number by 2 and adds it to the result of the modulus operation.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [3, 2, 0, 3, 7] and 3, we need to follow the steps:
1. Retrieve the number at index 3 from the list, which is 3.
2. Calculate the modulus of 3 with 42, which is 3.
3. Remove the number 3 from the list, leaving us with [3, 2, 0, 7].
4. Multiply the removed number 3 by 2, which is 6.
5. Add the result of the modulus operation (3) to the result of the multiplication (6), which is 3 + 6 = 9.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [3, 2, 0, 3, 7] and 3 is 9.
