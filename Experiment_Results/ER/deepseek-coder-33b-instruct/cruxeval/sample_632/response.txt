The function f takes a list as input. It uses the Bubble Sort algorithm to sort the list in ascending order. The outer loop runs from the last index of the list to the first index, and the inner loop runs from the first index to the current index of the outer loop. If the current element is greater than the next element, they are swapped. After each swap, the list is sorted again.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [63, 0, 1, 5, 9, 87, 0, 7, 25, 4], the Bubble Sort algorithm will be applied. The list will be sorted in ascending order.

<<<Output>>>
[0, 0, 1, 4, 5, 7, 9, 25, 63, 87]
