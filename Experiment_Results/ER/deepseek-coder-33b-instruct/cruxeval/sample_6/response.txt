The function f takes a dictionary dic as input. It sorts the dictionary items by the length of the string representation of the key-value pair, and then removes all but the last item from the dictionary. Finally, it returns the remaining item(s) in the dictionary as a list of tuples.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input {'11': 52, '65': 34, 'a': 12, '4': 52, '74': 31}, we need to follow the steps of the function:

1. Sort the dictionary items by the length of the string representation of the key-value pair. The sorted items are: ('a', 12), ('4', 52), ('11', 52), ('74', 31), ('65', 34).
2. Remove all but the last item from the dictionary. The last item is ('65', 34).
3. Return the remaining item(s) in the dictionary as a list of tuples. The remaining item is [('65', 34)].

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input {'11': 52, '65': 34, 'a': 12, '4': 52, '74': 31} is [('65', 34)].

<<<Output>>>
[('65', 34)]
