The function f takes a string and a prefix as input. It checks if the string starts with the given prefix. If it does, it removes the prefix from the string and returns the result. If the string does not start with the prefix, it simply returns the string as it is.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "Vipra" and "via", we need to check if "Vipra" starts with "via". It does not, so the output is simply "Vipra".

<<<Output>>>
'Vipra'
