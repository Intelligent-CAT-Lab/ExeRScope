The function f takes two strings as input: text and elem. It checks if elem is not an empty string. If it's not, it enters a while loop that continues as long as text starts with elem. In each iteration of the loop, it removes the first occurrence of elem from text. It then enters another while loop that continues as long as elem starts with text. In each iteration of this loop, it removes the first occurrence of text from elem. Finally, it returns a list containing elem and text.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "some" and "1", we need to follow the steps of the function.

First, it checks if elem is not an empty string. In this case, it is not, so it enters the first while loop. It checks if "some" starts with "1". It does not, so it skips the body of the loop and moves on to the second while loop. It checks if "1" starts with "some". It does not, so it skips the body of the loop and moves on to the return statement.

Finally, it returns a list containing "1" and "some".

<<<Output>>>
['1', 'some']
