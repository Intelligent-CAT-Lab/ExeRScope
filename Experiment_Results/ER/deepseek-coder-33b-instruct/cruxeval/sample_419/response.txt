The function f takes two parameters: a string text and a value. It checks if the value is in the text. If the value is not in the text, it returns an empty string. If the value is in the text, it partitions the text from the right at the first occurrence of the value, and returns the part before the value.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'mmfbifen' and 'i', we need to check if 'i' is in 'mmfbifen'. It is, so we partition the string from the right at the first occurrence of 'i'. The part before 'i' is 'mmfbifen', and the part after 'i' is 'fen'. Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'mmfbifen' and 'i' is 'mmfbifen'.

<<<Output>>>
'mmfbifen'
