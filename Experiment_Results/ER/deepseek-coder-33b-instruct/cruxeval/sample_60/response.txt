The function f takes a string doc as input. It iterates over each character in the string. If the character is an alphabet, it returns the capitalized version of the character. If no alphabet is found in the string, it returns '-'.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'raruwa', we need to check each character in the string. The first character 'r' is not an alphabet, so we move to the next character. The character 'a' is an alphabet, so we return the capitalized version of 'a', which is 'A'.

<<<Output>>>
'A'
