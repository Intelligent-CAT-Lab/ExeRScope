The function f takes two inputs: a character val and a string text. It first creates a list of indices where val is found in text. If val is not found in text, it returns -1. Otherwise, it returns the first index where val is found in text.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'o' and 'fnmart', we need to find the first index of 'o' in 'fnmart'. The string 'fnmart' does not contain 'o', so the output of executing the function f on the input 'o' and 'fnmart' is -1.

<<<Output>>>
-1
