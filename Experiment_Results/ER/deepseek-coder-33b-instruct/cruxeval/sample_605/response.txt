The function f takes a list nums as input. It first clears the list using the clear() method, which removes all elements from the list. Then it returns the string "quack".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [2, 5, 1, 7, 9, 3], we need to follow the steps in the function. First, it clears the list, so the list becomes empty. Then it returns the string "quack".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [2, 5, 1, 7, 9, 3] is "quack".
<<<Output>>>
'quack'
