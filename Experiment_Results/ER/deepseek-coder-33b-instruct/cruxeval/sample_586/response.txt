The function f takes a string text and a character char as input. It uses the rindex method of the string class, which returns the highest index of the specified character in the string.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "breakfast" and "e", we need to find the highest index of "e" in "breakfast".

The string "breakfast" has two "e"s. The first "e" is at index 1 and the second "e" is at index 6. Therefore, the highest index of "e" in "breakfast" is 6.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "breakfast" and "e" is 6.

<<<Output>>>
6
