The function f takes a dictionary data and an integer num as input. It creates a new dictionary new_dict and a list temp which contains the items of the dictionary data. It then iterates over the list temp in reverse order starting from the end of the list and ending at the num-th index. For each item, it adds it to the new_dict with a None value. After that, it returns a list that consists of the remaining items in temp and the items in new_dict.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input {1: 9, 2: 10, 3: 1} and 1, we need to follow the steps of the function.

First, the dictionary data is converted into a list of tuples. The list temp is [(1, 9), (2, 10), (3, 1)].

Then, the function iterates over the list temp in reverse order starting from the end of the list and ending at the 1-st index. For each item, it adds it to the new_dict with a None value. The new_dict becomes {(3, 1): None}.

Finally, the function returns a list that consists of the remaining items in temp and the items in new_dict. The remaining items in temp are [(1, 9), (2, 10)], and the items in new_dict are [((3, 1), None)]. Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input {1: 9, 2: 10, 3: 1} and 1 is [(1, 9), (2, 10), ((3, 1), None)].

<<<Output>>>
[(1, 9), (2, 10), ((3, 1), None)]
