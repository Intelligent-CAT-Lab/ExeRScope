The function f takes two strings, text1 and text2, as input. It initializes an empty list nums. Then it iterates over each character in text2, and for each character, it counts the number of times it appears in text1 and appends this count to nums. Finally, it returns the sum of all counts in nums.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'jivespdcxc' and 'sx', we need to follow the steps of the function:

1. For the first character 's' in text2, it counts the number of times it appears in text1, which is 1.
2. For the second character 'x' in text2, it counts the number of times it appears in text1, which is 0.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'jivespdcxc' and 'sx' is 1.
