The function f takes an array and an element as input. It converts the element to a string and initializes a counter d to 0. It then iterates over each element in the array, converts it to a string, and checks if it is equal to the string version of the input element. If it is, it increments the counter d. Finally, it returns the value of d.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input ```([-1, 2, 1, -8, -8, 2], 2)```, we need to follow the steps outlined above.

1. Convert the element 2 to a string, which gives us "2".
2. Initialize a counter d to 0.
3. Iterate over each element in the array:
   - Convert the element to a string.
   - Check if the string version of the element is equal to "2".
   - If it is, increment the counter d.
4. Return the value of d.

After following these steps, we find that the element "2" appears twice in the array, so the output of executing the function f on the input ```([-1, 2, 1, -8, -8, 2], 2)``` is 2.
