The function f takes three parameters: start, end, and interval. It first generates a list of numbers from start to end (inclusive) with a step of interval. If the number 1 is in the list, it replaces the last element of the list with end + 1. Finally, it returns the length of the list.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input f(3, 10, 1), we need to follow the steps:
1. Generate a list of numbers from 3 to 10 (inclusive) with a step of 1. The list is [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10].
2. Since 1 is not in the list, we do not need to replace the last element.
3. Return the length of the list, which is 8.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input f(3, 10, 1) is 8.
