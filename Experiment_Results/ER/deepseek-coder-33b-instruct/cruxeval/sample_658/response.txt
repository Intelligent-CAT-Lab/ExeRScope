The function f takes a dictionary d and a list get_ary as input. It initializes an empty list result. Then it iterates over each key in get_ary, appends the value associated with that key in the dictionary d to the result list. If the key is not present in the dictionary, it appends None. Finally, it returns the result list.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input `{3: "swims like a bull"}` and `[3, 2, 'c', True, 5]`, we need to follow the steps in the function.

1. Initialize result as an empty list.
2. For each key in get_ary, append the value associated with that key in the dictionary d.
3. The key 3 is present in the dictionary d, so append "swims like a bull" to result.
4. The key 2 is not present in the dictionary d, so append None to result.
5. The key 'c' is not present in the dictionary d, so append None to result.
6. The key True is not present in the dictionary d, so append None to result.
7. The key 5 is not present in the dictionary d, so append None to result.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input `{3: "swims like a bull"}` and `[3, 2, 'c', True, 5]` is `["swims like a bull", None, None, None, None]`.

<<<Output>>>
['swims like a bull', None, None, None, None]
