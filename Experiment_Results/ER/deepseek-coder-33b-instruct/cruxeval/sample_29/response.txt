The function f takes a string text as input. It first filters out all the numeric characters from the text using the filter function and the str.isnumeric method. It then asserts that the length of the resulting list nums is greater than 0. If the length of nums is not greater than 0, it raises an AssertionError. Finally, it joins all the elements in nums into a single string and returns it.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input '-123   \t+314', the function first filters out all the numeric characters from the text, resulting in the list ['1', '2', '3', '3', '1', '4']. It then asserts that the length of this list is greater than 0, which it is, so it proceeds to join all the elements in the list into a single string, resulting in '123314'.

<<<Output>>>
'123314'
