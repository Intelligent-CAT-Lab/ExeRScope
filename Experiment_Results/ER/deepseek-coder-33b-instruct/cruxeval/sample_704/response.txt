The function f takes a string s, an integer n, and a string c as input. It first calculates the width of the output string by multiplying the length of c by n. Then, it enters a loop that runs for (width - len(s)) times. In each iteration of the loop, it prepends c to s. Finally, it returns s.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input '.', 0, '99', we need to follow the steps of the function.

First, calculate the width of the output string. The length of c is 2, and n is 0. So, the width is 0.

Then, the loop doesn't run because width - len(s) is 0 - 1 = -1. So, the loop doesn't run.

Finally, the function returns s, which is '.', the input string.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input '.', 0, '99' is '.'.

<<<Output>>>
'.'
