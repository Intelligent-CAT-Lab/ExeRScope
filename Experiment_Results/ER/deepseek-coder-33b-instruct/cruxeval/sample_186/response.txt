The function f takes a string text as input. It splits the text into a list of words using the split() function. Then it applies the lstrip() function to each word in the list, which removes any leading whitespace from each word. Finally, it joins the words back together into a single string using the join() function, with a space character as the separator.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'pvtso', we need to follow the steps outlined above.

1. Split the input string 'pvtso' into a list of words: ['pvtso'].
2. Apply the lstrip() function to each word in the list, which removes any leading whitespace from each word. The result is still ['pvtso'].
3. Join the words back together into a single string using the join() function, with a space character as the separator. The result is 'pvtso'.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'pvtso' is 'pvtso'.

<<<Output>>>
'pvtso'
