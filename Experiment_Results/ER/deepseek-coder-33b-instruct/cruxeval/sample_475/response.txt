The function f takes an array and an index as input. If the index is less than 0, it calculates the index from the end of the array. It then returns the element at the calculated index.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1] and 0, we first check if the index is less than 0. In this case, it is not, so we don't need to calculate the index from the end of the array. Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [1] and 0 is 1.
