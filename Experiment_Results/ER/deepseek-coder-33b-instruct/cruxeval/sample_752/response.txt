The function f takes a string s and an integer amount as input. It first calculates the difference between the length of the string s and the amount. This difference is then multiplied by the string 'z' and concatenated with the string s.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'abc' and 8, we first calculate the difference between the length of 'abc' (3) and 8 (3). This difference is 5. We then multiply 'z' by 5 to get 'zzzzz'. Finally, we concatenate 'zzzzz' with 'abc' to get 'zzzzzabc'.

<<<Output>>>
'zzzzzabc'
