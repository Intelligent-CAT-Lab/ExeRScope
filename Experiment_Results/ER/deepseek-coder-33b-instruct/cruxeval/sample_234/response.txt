The function f takes two parameters: a string text and a character char. It first calculates the length of the string text and assigns it to the variable position. Then it checks if the character char is in the string text. If it is, it finds the index of the character in the string and assigns it to the variable position. If the position is greater than 1, it calculates the remainder of the position plus 1 divided by the length of the string text and assigns it to the variable position. Finally, it returns the value of position.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'wduhzxlfk' and 'w', we need to follow the steps of the function. The length of the string 'wduhzxlfk' is 9. The character 'w' is in the string 'wduhzxlfk' at index 0. Since 0 is not greater than 1, the position remains 0.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'wduhzxlfk' and 'w' is 0.
