The function f takes a string text and a character c as input. It first converts the string into a list of characters. Then it checks if the character c is in the text. If it is not, it raises a ValueError. If it is, it removes the last occurrence of the character c from the list. Finally, it joins the list back into a string and returns it.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'uufhl' and 'l', we need to follow the steps of the function.

1. Convert 'uufhl' into a list of characters: ['u', 'u', 'f', 'h', 'l']
2. Check if 'l' is in the text: Yes, it is.
3. Remove the last occurrence of 'l' from the list: ['u', 'u', 'f', 'h']
4. Join the list back into a string: 'uufh'

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'uufhl' and 'l' is 'uufh'.

<<<Output>>>
'uufh'
