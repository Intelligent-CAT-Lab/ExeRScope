The function f takes a list of names as input. It first calculates the total number of names in the list. Then it iterates over each name in the list. For each name, it checks if the name is alphabetic (i.e., contains only letters). If the name is alphabetic, it increments the count of alphabetic names. Finally, it returns the count of alphabetic names.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input ['sharron', 'Savannah', 'Mike Cherokee'], we need to follow the steps outlined above.

1. The total number of names in the list is 3.
2. The first name 'sharron' is alphabetic, so the count of alphabetic names is incremented to 1.
3. The second name 'Savannah' is alphabetic, so the count of alphabetic names is incremented to 2.
4. The third name 'Mike Cherokee' is not alphabetic, so the count of alphabetic names remains at 2.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input ['sharron', 'Savannah', 'Mike Cherokee'] is 2.
