The function f takes a list container and an element cron as input. It checks if cron is in container. If cron is not in container, it returns the container as it is. If cron is in container, it creates two new lists pref and suff. pref is the part of container before cron and suff is the part of container after cron. It then returns the concatenation of pref and suff.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input ([], 2), we need to check if 2 is in []. Since 2 is not in [], the function returns [].

<<<Output>>>
