The function f takes a list of numbers as input. It initializes two variables a and b. a is set to -1 and b is set to the input list excluding the first element.

The while loop continues as long as a is less than or equal to the first element of b. Inside the loop, the first element of b is removed from the input list nums. Then, a is set to 0 and b is updated to exclude the first element.

The loop continues until a is greater than the first element of b, at which point the loop terminates. The function then returns the modified input list nums.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [-1, 5, 3, -2, -6, 8, 8], we need to follow the steps of the function.

Initially, a is -1 and b is [5, 3, -2, -6, 8, 8]. The first element of b is 5, which is greater than a, so the loop does not execute. The function returns the input list as it is.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [-1, 5, 3, -2, -6, 8, 8] is [-1, 5, 3, -2, -6, 8, 8].

<<<Output>>>
[-1, 5, 3, -2, -6, 8, 8]
