The function f takes a dictionary d as input. It first adds a key-value pair 'luck': 42 to the dictionary. Then it clears the dictionary. Finally, it returns a new dictionary {1: False, 2 :0}.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input {}, we need to follow the steps in the function.

1. Add 'luck': 42 to the dictionary {}. The dictionary becomes {'luck': 42}.
2. Clear the dictionary. The dictionary becomes {}.
3. Return the dictionary {1: False, 2 :0}.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input {} is {1: False, 2 :0}.

<<<Output>>>
{1: False, 2 :0}
