The function f takes an integer n as input. It converts the integer n into a string, then iterates over each character in the string. For each character, it adds the character to the string streak, repeated int(c) * 2 times. The ljust() function is used to left-justify the character in the string, padding it with spaces on the right side.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 1, we need to follow the steps of the function.

1. Convert 1 to a string: '1'
2. Iterate over each character in the string: '1'
3. For the character '1', repeat it 2 times: '11'
4. Convert the string '11' to a list of characters: ['1', '1']
5. Join the list of characters into a string: '11'

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 1 is '11'.

<<<Output>>>
'11'
