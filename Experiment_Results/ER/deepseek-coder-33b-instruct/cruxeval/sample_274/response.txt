The function f takes a list of numbers nums and a target number as input. It initializes a count variable to 0. Then it iterates over each number n1 in nums, and for each n1, it iterates over each number n2 in nums again. For each pair of numbers (n1, n2), it checks if the sum of n1 and n2 equals the target. If it does, it increments the count by 1. Finally, it returns the count.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input ([1, 2, 3], 4), we need to follow the steps of the function.

For n1 = 1, n2 = 1, the sum is 2, which is not equal to the target 4.
For n1 = 1, n2 = 2, the sum is 3, which is not equal to the target 4.
For n1 = 1, n2 = 3, the sum is 4, which is equal to the target 4.
For n1 = 2, n2 = 1, the sum is 3, which is not equal to the target 4.
For n1 = 2, n2 = 2, the sum is 4, which is equal to the target 4.
For n1 = 2, n2 = 3, the sum is 5, which is not equal to the target 4.
For n1 = 3, n2 = 1, the sum is 4, which is equal to the target 4.
For n1 = 3, n2 = 2, the sum is 5, which is not equal to the target 4.
For n1 = 3, n2 = 3, the sum is 6, which is not equal to the target 4.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input ([1, 2, 3], 4) is 2.
