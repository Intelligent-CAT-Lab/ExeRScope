The function f takes a string s and a character c as input. It first splits the string s into a list of words using the split() method. Then it reverses the list of words using the [::-1] slicing technique. It then joins the reversed list of words into a string with "  " as the separator using the join() method. Finally, it concatenates the character c, "  ", and the reversed string with "  " as the separator and returns the result.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'Hello There' and '*', we need to follow the steps outlined above.

First, the string 'Hello There' is split into the list ['Hello', 'There'].
Then, the list is reversed to ['There', 'Hello'].
The list is then joined into the string 'There  Hello' with "  " as the separator.
Finally, the character '*' is concatenated with "  ", and the reversed string 'There  Hello', to get the output '*  There  Hello'.

<<<Output>>>
'*  There  Hello'
