The function f takes three parameters: instagram, imgur, and wins. It first creates a list photos with the elements instagram and imgur. Then it checks if instagram and imgur are equal. If they are, it returns wins. If they are not equal, it checks if wins is equal to 1. If wins is 1, it removes and returns the last element of the list photos. If wins is not 1, it reverses the list photos and removes and returns the last element.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input ```f(['sdfs', 'drcr', '2e'], ['sdfs', 'dr2c', 'QWERTY'], 0)```, we need to follow the steps of the function. 

First, it creates a list photos with the elements ```['sdfs', 'drcr', '2e']``` and ```['sdfs', 'dr2c', 'QWERTY']```. Then it checks if the two lists are equal. They are not equal, so it moves to the next condition. It checks if wins is equal to 1. It is not, so it reverses the list photos to ```[['sdfs', 'dr2c', 'QWERTY'], ['sdfs', 'drcr', '2e']]``` and removes and returns the last element, which is ```['sdfs', 'drcr', '2e']```.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input ```f(['sdfs', 'drcr', '2e'], ['sdfs', 'dr2c', 'QWERTY'], 0)``` is ```['sdfs', 'drcr', '2e']```.

<<<Output>>>
['sdfs', 'drcr', '2e']
