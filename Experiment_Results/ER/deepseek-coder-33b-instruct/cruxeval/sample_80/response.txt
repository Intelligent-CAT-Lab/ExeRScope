The function f takes a string s as input. It first removes any trailing whitespace from the string using the rstrip() method. Then it reverses the string using the reversed() function. Finally, it joins the reversed string back into a single string using the join() method.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'ab        ', we need to follow the steps outlined above.

1. The rstrip() method removes the trailing whitespace from the string, resulting in 'ab'.
2. The reversed() function reverses the string, resulting in 'ba'.
3. The join() method joins the reversed string back into a single string, resulting in 'ba'.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'ab        ' is 'ba'.

<<<Output>>>
'ba'
