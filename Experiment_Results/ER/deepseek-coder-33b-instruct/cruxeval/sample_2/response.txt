The function f takes a string text as input. It converts the string into a list of characters. Then it iterates over the string '+'. For each character in '+', it checks if it is in the list new_text. If it is, it removes that character from the list. Finally, it joins the list back into a string and returns it.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'hbtofdeiequ', we need to follow the steps of the function.

1. Convert 'hbtofdeiequ' into a list of characters: ['h', 'b', 't', 'o', 'f', 'd', 'e', 'i', 'e', 'q', 'u']
2. Iterate over the string '+'. Since '+' only contains one character, it will only iterate once.
3. Check if '+' is in the list. Since '+' is not in the list, it will not remove any characters.
4. Join the list back into a string: 'hbtofdeiequ'

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'hbtofdeiequ' is 'hbtofdeiequ'.

<<<Output>>>
'hbtofdeiequ'
