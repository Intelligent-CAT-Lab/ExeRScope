The function f takes an array as input. It first removes the last element of the array using the pop() method and assigns it to the variable n. Then it extends the array by adding n twice to the end of the array. The final return value is the modified array.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 1, 2, 2], we need to follow the steps of the function.

1. The last element of the array is removed, which is 2.
2. The number 2 is then added twice to the end of the array.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 1, 2, 2] is [1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2].

<<<Output>>>
[1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2]
