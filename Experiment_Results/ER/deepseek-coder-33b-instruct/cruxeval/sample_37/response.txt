The function f takes a string text as input and creates an array text_arr. It then iterates over the length of the text, and for each iteration, it appends a slice of the text from the current index to the end of the text to the text_arr.

For the input '123', the function will iterate three times. On the first iteration, it will append '123' to text_arr. On the second iteration, it will append '23' to text_arr. On the third iteration, it will append '3' to text_arr.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input '123' is ['123', '23', '3'].

<<<Output>>>
['123', '23', '3']
