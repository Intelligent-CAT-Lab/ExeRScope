The function f takes a list of numbers nums and two integers pop1 and pop2 as input. It removes the elements at the indices (pop1 - 1) and (pop2 - 1) from the list nums. The function then returns the modified list nums.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 5, 2, 3, 6], 2, 4, we need to remove the elements at the indices (2 - 1) and (4 - 1) from the list [1, 5, 2, 3, 6]. The indices are 1 and 3 respectively. Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 5, 2, 3, 6], 2, 4 is [1, 2, 6].

<<<Output>>>
[1, 2, 6]
