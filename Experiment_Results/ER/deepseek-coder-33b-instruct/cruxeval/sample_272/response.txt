The function f takes two arguments: a list base_list and a list nums. It first extends the base_list with the elements of nums. Then it makes a copy of the extended list. After that, it iterates over the negative range of the length of nums, appending the elements of the copied list to the result list. The range is negative because it starts from -len(nums) and ends at 0. This means it iterates over the elements of the copied list in reverse order. Finally, it returns the result list.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input ```f([9, 7, 5, 3, 1], [2, 4, 6, 8, 0])```, we need to follow the steps of the function.

First, it extends the base_list with the elements of nums, resulting in [9, 7, 5, 3, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 0].
Then, it makes a copy of the extended list, resulting in [9, 7, 5, 3, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 0].
Next, it iterates over the elements of the copied list in reverse order, appending each element to the result list. The result list is [9, 7, 5, 3, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 0, 0, 8, 6, 4, 2, 0].
Finally, it returns the result list.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input ```f([9, 7, 5, 3, 1], [2, 4, 6, 8, 0])``` is [9, 7, 5, 3, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 0, 0, 8, 6, 4, 2, 0].

<<<Output>>>
[9, 7, 5, 3, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 0, 0, 8, 6, 4, 2, 0]
