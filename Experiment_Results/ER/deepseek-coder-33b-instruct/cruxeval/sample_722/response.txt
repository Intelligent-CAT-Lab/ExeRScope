The function f takes a string text as input. It initializes an empty string out. Then it iterates over each character in the text. If the character is an uppercase letter, it converts it to lowercase and appends it to out. If the character is a lowercase letter, it converts it to uppercase and appends it to out. Finally, it returns out.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input ',wPzPppdl/', we need to iterate over each character in the string. If the character is an uppercase letter, it converts it to lowercase. If the character is a lowercase letter, it converts it to uppercase. Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input ',wPzPppdl/' is ',WpZpPPDL/'.

<<<Output>>>
',WpZpPPDL/'
