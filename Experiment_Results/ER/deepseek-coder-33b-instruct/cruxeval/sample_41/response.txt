The function f takes an array and a list of values as input. It first reverses the array, then for each value in the list, it inserts the value at the middle index of the array. After inserting all values, it reverses the array again. The final array is returned as the output.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [58] and [21, 92], we need to follow the steps of the function:
1. Reverse the array [58] to get [58].
2. Insert 21 at the middle index of the array [58], which is [21, 58].
3. Insert 92 at the middle index of the array [21, 58], which is [21, 92, 58].
4. Reverse the array [21, 92, 58] to get [58, 92, 21].

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [58] and [21, 92] is [58, 92, 21].

<<<Output>>>
[58, 92, 21]
