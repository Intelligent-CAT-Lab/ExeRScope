The function f takes two inputs: a string n and a string s. It checks if the string s starts with the string n. If it does, it splits the string s at the first occurrence of n, and returns the concatenation of the part before n, n itself, and the part after n. If s does not start with n, it simply returns s.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'xqc' and 'mRcwVqXsRDRb', we need to check if 'mRcwVqXsRDRb' starts with 'xqc'. It does not, so the output is simply 'mRcwVqXsRDRb'.

<<<Output>>>
'mRcwVqXsRDRb'
