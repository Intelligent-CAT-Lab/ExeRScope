The function f takes a list of numbers nums and an index i as input. It removes the element at index i from the list nums using the pop method and then returns the modified list.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [35, 45, 3, 61, 39, 27, 47] and 0, we need to remove the element at index 0 from the list.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [35, 45, 3, 61, 39, 27, 47] and 0 is [45, 3, 61, 39, 27, 47].

<<<Output>>>
[45, 3, 61, 39, 27, 47]
