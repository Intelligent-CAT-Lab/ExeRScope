The function f takes a string text and a character char as input. It checks if the string text is not empty. If it's not empty, it removes the prefix of the string that matches the character char, then it removes the last character of the string. After that, it capitalizes the last character of the string and returns the modified string.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'querist' and 'u', we need to follow the steps of the function.

1. The string 'querist' does not start with 'u', so the first removeprefix operation does not change the string.
2. The last character of the string 'querist' is 't', so the second removeprefix operation does not change the string.
3. The last character of the string 'querist' is 't', so the capitalize operation changes it to 'T'.
4. The string becomes 'querisT'.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'querist' and 'u' is 'querisT'.

<<<Output>>>
'querisT'
