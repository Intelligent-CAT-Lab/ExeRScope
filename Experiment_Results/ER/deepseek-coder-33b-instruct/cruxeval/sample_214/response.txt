The function `f` takes a string `sample` as input. It initializes a variable `i` with the value `-1`. Then it enters a while loop where it keeps finding the next occurrence of the character `/` in the string `sample` starting from the position `i+1`. The loop continues until there are no more occurrences of `/` in the string.

After the while loop, the function uses the `rindex` method of the string `sample` to find the last occurrence of `/` in the string before the position `i`. The `rindex` method returns the highest index of the specified value, which is why it is used here.

Given the input `'present/here/car%2Fwe'`, the function `f` will first find the position of the first `/`, which is at index `7`. Then it will find the next `/`, which is at index `12`. The while loop will end because there are no more `/` in the string.

The function will then use the `rindex` method to find the last `/` before the position `i`, which is `12`. Therefore, the output of executing the function `f` on the input `'present/here/car%2Fwe'` is `12`.
