The function f takes two arguments: an update dictionary and a starting dictionary. It first makes a copy of the starting dictionary. Then it iterates over the keys in the update dictionary. For each key, if the key is already in the copied dictionary, it adds the value of the key in the update dictionary to the value of the key in the copied dictionary. If the key is not in the copied dictionary, it adds the key and its value from the update dictionary to the copied dictionary. Finally, it returns the copied dictionary.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input `f({}, {'desciduous': 2})`, we need to follow the steps of the function. First, it makes a copy of the starting dictionary `{'desciduous': 2}`. Then it iterates over the keys in the update dictionary `{}`. Since the update dictionary is empty, it does not add any keys to the copied dictionary. Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input `f({}, {'desciduous': 2})` is `{'desciduous': 2}`.

<<<Output>>>
{'desciduous': 2}
