The function f takes a list list_x as input. It first calculates the length of the list and stores it in the variable item_count. Then it initializes an empty list new_list.

In the for loop, it pops the last element from list_x and appends it to new_list. This process is repeated for all elements in list_x.

When the function is called with the input [5, 8, 6, 8, 4], it first calculates the length of the list which is 5. Then it pops the last element from the list and appends it to new_list. This process is repeated for all elements in the list.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [5, 8, 6, 8, 4] is [4, 8, 6, 8, 5].

<<<Output>>>
[4, 8, 6, 8, 5]
