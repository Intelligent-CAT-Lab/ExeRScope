The function f takes a string txt as input. It initializes an empty dictionary coincidences. Then it iterates over each character c in the string txt. If c is already a key in the dictionary coincidences, it increments the value associated with that key by 1. If c is not a key in the dictionary, it adds c as a key with the value 1. Finally, it returns the sum of all values in the dictionary coincidences.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "11 1 1", we need to count the number of occurrences of each character in the string "11 1 1". The dictionary coincidences would look like this: {'1': 4, ' ': 2}. The sum of all values in this dictionary is 6.
