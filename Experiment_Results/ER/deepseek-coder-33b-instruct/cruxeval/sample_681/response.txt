The function f takes an array, an index ind and an element elem as input. It inserts the element elem at the index ind in the array. If ind is less than 0, it inserts the element at index -5. If ind is greater than the length of the array, it inserts the element at the end of the array. Otherwise, it inserts the element at the index ind + 1.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 5, 8, 2, 0, 3], 2, 7, we need to insert 7 at the index 2 + 1 = 3 in the array [1, 5, 8, 2, 0, 3].

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 5, 8, 2, 0, 3], 2, 7 is [1, 5, 7, 8, 2, 0, 3].

<<<Output>>>
[1, 5, 7, 8, 2, 0, 3]
