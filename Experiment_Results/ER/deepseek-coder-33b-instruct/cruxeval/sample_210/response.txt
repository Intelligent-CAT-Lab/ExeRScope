The function f takes three parameters: n, m, and num. It first generates a list of numbers from n to m (inclusive). Then it initializes a variable j to 0. It enters a while loop that continues indefinitely. In each iteration of the loop, it increments j by num and takes the modulus of the length of x_list. If the element at the index j in x_list is even, it returns that element.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 46, 48, 21, we need to follow the steps of the function.

1. The list x_list is generated as [46, 47, 48].
2. j is initialized to 0.
3. In the first iteration of the while loop, j becomes 21 % 3 = 0.
4. The element at index 0 in x_list is 46, which is not even, so the loop continues.
5. In the second iteration of the while loop, j becomes (0 + 21) % 3 = 2.
6. The element at index 2 in x_list is 48, which is even, so the function returns 48.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 46, 48, 21 is 48.
