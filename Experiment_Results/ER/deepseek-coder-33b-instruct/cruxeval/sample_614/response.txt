The function f takes three parameters: a text string, a substring, and an occurrence number. It finds the last occurrence of the substring in the text string, then the second last, and so on, until it finds the nth last occurrence of the substring. If it can't find the nth last occurrence, it returns -1.

In the given example, the text string is 'zjegiymjc', the substring is 'j', and the occurrence number is 2.

The function starts by initializing a counter n to 0. It then enters a loop that continues until it can't find the substring in the text string anymore.

In each iteration of the loop, it finds the last occurrence of the substring in the text string using the rfind method. If it can't find the substring, it breaks the loop and returns -1. If it finds the substring and n is equal to the occurrence number, it returns the index of the substring. If n is not equal to the occurrence number, it increments n and removes the last occurrence of the substring from the text string.

In the given example, the function will first find the last occurrence of 'j' in 'zjegiymjc', which is at index 5. Then it will find the second last occurrence of 'j' in 'zjegiy', which is at index 2. Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'zjegiymjc', 'j', 2 is 2.
