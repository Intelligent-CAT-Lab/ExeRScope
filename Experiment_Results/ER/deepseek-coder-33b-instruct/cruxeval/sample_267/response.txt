The function f takes a string text and an integer space as input. If space is less than 0, it returns the text as it is. Otherwise, it returns the text justified to the left with the length of the text divided by 2 plus the space.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'sowpf' and -7, we need to follow the steps in the function. The length of 'sowpf' is 5, so the length of the justified text would be 5 // 2 + (-7) = -1. Since the length is negative, the function returns the text as it is.

<<<Output>>>
'sowpf'
