The function f takes a string code as input and returns a string that is the concatenation of the input code and the encoding of the input code.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input '148', we need to encode '148' into bytes. The encoding of '148' is b'148'. Then, we concatenate '148' with its encoding b'148' using the format function.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input '148' is '148: b'148''.

<<<Output>>>
'148: b'148''
