The function f takes an array as input. It initializes a string s with a space. Then it joins all the elements of the array into a string and concatenates it with s. Finally, it returns s.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [' ', '  ', '    ', '   '], we need to follow the steps of the function:
1. Initialize s with a space.
2. Join all the elements of the array into a string, which results in "     ".
3. Concatenate this string with s, resulting in "     ".

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [' ', '  ', '    ', '   '] is "     ".
