The function f takes three parameters: values, text, and markers. It first removes the characters in values from the right side of the text using the rstrip() function. Then it removes the characters in markers from the right side of the text using the rstrip() function.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input '2Pn', 'yCxpg2C2Pny2', '', we need to remove the characters in '2Pn' from the right side of 'yCxpg2C2Pny2' and then remove the characters in '' from the right side of the result. Since '' is an empty string, it doesn't remove any characters.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input '2Pn', 'yCxpg2C2Pny2', '' is 'yCxpg2C2Pny2'.

<<<Output>>>
'yCxpg2C2Pny2'
