The function f takes an array as input. It first makes a copy of the array, then reverses the copy, and finally multiplies each item in the reversed copy by 2.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], we need to follow the steps outlined in the function:
1. Copy the array: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
2. Reverse the copy: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
3. Multiply each item by 2: [10, 8, 6, 4, 2]

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] is [10, 8, 6, 4, 2].

<<<Output>>>
[10, 8, 6, 4, 2]
