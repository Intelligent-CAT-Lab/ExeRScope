The function f takes an array as input. It first reverses the array, then clears it, then extends it with 'x' repeated the length of the array, and finally reverses it again.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [3, -2, 0], we need to follow the steps:
1. Reverse the array: [0, -2, 3]
2. Clear the array: []
3. Extend the array with 'x' repeated the length of the array: ['x', 'x', 'x']
4. Reverse the array: ['x', 'x', 'x']

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [3, -2, 0] is ['x', 'x', 'x'].

<<<Output>>>
['x', 'x', 'x']
