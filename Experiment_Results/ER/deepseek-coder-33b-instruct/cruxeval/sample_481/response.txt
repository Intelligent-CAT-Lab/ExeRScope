The function f takes a list of values, and two items as input. It checks the last item in the list. If the last item is equal to item2, it checks if the first item is not in the rest of the list. If it is not, it appends the first item to the list. If the last item is equal to item1, it checks if the first item is equal to item2. If it is, it appends the first item to the list. Finally, it returns the list.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 1], 2, 3, we need to follow the steps in the function. The last item in the list is 1, which is not equal to 3. Therefore, the first condition is not met. Then, the last item in the list is 1, which is equal to 2. The first item in the list is 1, which is not equal to 3. Therefore, the second condition is not met. Therefore, the list remains the same.

<<<Output>>>
