The function f takes a list of integers as input. It first initializes a list counts of size 301 with all elements as 0. Then it iterates over the input list ints and for each integer i, it increments the count of i in counts. After that, it iterates over the counts list and if the count of an integer i is greater than or equal to 3, it appends the string representation of i to the list r. Finally, it clears the counts list and returns a string that is the concatenation of all elements in r, separated by a space.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [2, 3, 5, 2, 4, 5, 2, 89], we need to follow the steps of the function.

1. Initialize counts as [0] * 301.
2. For each integer in the input list, increment the corresponding count in counts.
3. For each count in counts, if the count is greater than or equal to 3, append the index to the list r.
4. Clear counts.
5. Join all elements in r with a space and return the result.

So, the output of executing the function f on the input [2, 3, 5, 2, 4, 5, 2, 89] is an empty string, because there are no integers that appear 3 or more times in the input list.
