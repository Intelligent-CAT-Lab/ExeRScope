The function f takes two parameters: text and suffix. It checks if the suffix starts with a "/". If it does, it returns the concatenation of text and suffix without the first character (which is "/"). If the suffix does not start with a "/", it simply returns the text.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'hello.txt' and '/', we need to check if the suffix starts with a "/". In this case, it does, so we need to concatenate text and suffix without the first character (which is "/").

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'hello.txt' and '/' is 'hello.txt'.

<<<Output>>>
'hello.txt'
