The function f takes a list of numbers as input. It sorts the list in ascending order, then creates a new list new_nums. If the length of the list is even, it adds the two middle numbers to new_nums. If the length is odd, it adds the middle number to new_nums. Then, it inserts the numbers from the end of the list to the beginning of the list and appends the numbers from the beginning to the end of the list to new_nums.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1], we need to follow the steps of the function.

1. Sort the list: [1]
2. The length of the list is 1, which is odd. So, add the middle number to new_nums: [1]
3. Insert the numbers from the end of the list to the beginning of the list and append the numbers from the beginning to the end of the list to new_nums: [1]

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [1] is [1].
