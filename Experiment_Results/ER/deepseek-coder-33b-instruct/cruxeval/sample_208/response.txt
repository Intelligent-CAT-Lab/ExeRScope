The function f takes a list of strings as input. It initializes an empty list result. Then it iterates over each string in the input list. For each string, it iterates over each character in the string. If the character is not a digit, it appends the character to the result list. Finally, it returns the result list.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input ['123', 'cat', 'd dee'], we need to follow the steps of the function.

1. Initialize result as an empty list.
2. Iterate over each string in the input list.
3. For the first string '123', iterate over each character. '1', '2', and '3' are all digits, so no characters are appended to result.
4. For the second string 'cat', iterate over each character. 'c', 'a', and 't' are not digits, so they are appended to result in that order.
5. For the third string 'd dee', iterate over each character. 'd', ' ', 'd', 'e', 'e' are not digits, so they are appended to result in that order.
6. After all iterations, return result.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input ['123', 'cat', 'd dee'] is ['c', 'a', 't', 'd', ' ', 'd', 'e', 'e'].

<<<Output>>>
['c', 'a', 't', 'd', ' ', 'd', 'e', 'e']
