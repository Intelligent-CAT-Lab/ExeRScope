The function f takes a string text as input. It replaces all spaces in the text with no space, assigns the result to the global variable field. It also replaces all '0's in the text with spaces, assigns the result to the global variable g. Finally, it replaces all '1's in the text with 'i's, and returns the result.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input '00000000 00000000 01101100 01100101 01101110', we need to follow the steps of the function.

1. Replace all spaces in the text with no space. The result is '0000000000000000011011000110010101101110'.
2. Assign the result to the global variable field.
3. Replace all '0's in the text with spaces. The result is '        1101100 1100101 1101110'.
4. Assign the result to the global variable g.
5. Replace all '1's in the text with 'i's. The result is '        1101100 1100101 1101110'.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input '00000000 00000000 01101100 01100101 01101110' is '        1101100 1100101 1101110'.

<<<Output>>>
'        1101100 1100101 1101110'
