The function f takes a string text as input. It then encodes the text into utf-8 format and iterates over each character in the encoded text. If the character is equal to 61 (which is the ASCII value for '='), it breaks the loop. If the character is 0, it skips the current iteration. For all other characters, it appends the character followed by a semicolon and a space, encoded into utf-8 format, to the list res. Finally, it joins all the elements in the list res into a single byte string and returns it.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'os||agx5', we need to follow the steps outlined in the function.

1. Encode 'os||agx5' into utf-8 format. The result is b'os||agx5'.
2. Iterate over each character in the encoded text.
3. If the character is equal to 61, break the loop.
4. If the character is 0, skip the current iteration.
5. For all other characters, append the character followed by a semicolon and a space, encoded into utf-8 format, to the list res.
6. Join all the elements in the list res into a single byte string and return it.

The output of executing the function f on the input 'os||agx5' is b'111; 115; 124; 124; 97; 103; 120; 53; '.

<<<Output>>>
b'111; 115; 124; 124; 97; 103; 120; 53; '
