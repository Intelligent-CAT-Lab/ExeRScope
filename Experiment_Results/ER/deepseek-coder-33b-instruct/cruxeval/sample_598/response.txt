The function f takes a string text and an integer n as input. It first calculates the length of the string text. Then it returns a slice of the string text starting from the index calculated by `length*(n%4)` to the end of the string.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'abc' and 1, we first calculate the length of 'abc' which is 3. Then we calculate `3*(1%4)` which is 3. So, the slice starts from index 3 to the end of the string. Since there is no character at index 3 in 'abc', the slice is empty and the output is an empty string.
