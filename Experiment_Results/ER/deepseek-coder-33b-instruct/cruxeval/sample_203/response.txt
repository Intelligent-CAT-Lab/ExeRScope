The function f takes a dictionary d as input. It first clears the dictionary using the clear() method, which removes all items from the dictionary. Then it returns the modified dictionary.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input {'a': 3, 'b': -1, 'c': 'Dum'}, we need to follow the steps:
1. Clear the dictionary.
2. Return the modified dictionary.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input {'a': 3, 'b': -1, 'c': 'Dum'} is {}.

<<<Output>>>
