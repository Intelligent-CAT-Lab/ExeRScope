The function f takes an array and a value as input. It first reverses the array and removes the last element. Then it creates a new list of dictionaries, where each dictionary has a key-value pair where the key is the last element of the array and the value is the input value. It then updates a result dictionary with the dictionaries in the odd list. The final result is the result dictionary.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input ['23'], 123, we need to follow the steps of the function.

1. Reverse the array ['23'] to get ['23'].
2. Remove the last element of the array to get [].
3. Create a new list of dictionaries, where each dictionary has a key-value pair where the key is the last element of the array and the value is the input value. But since the array is empty, this step does not add any dictionaries to the odd list.
4. Update a result dictionary with the dictionaries in the odd list. But since the odd list is empty, this step does not change the result dictionary.
5. Return the result dictionary, which is also empty.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input ['23'], 123 is {}.
