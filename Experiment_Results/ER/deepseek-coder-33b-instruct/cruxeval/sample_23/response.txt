The function f takes two parameters: text and chars. If chars is not empty, it removes the characters specified in chars from the right end of the text. If chars is empty, it removes the spaces from the right end of the text. If the resulting text is empty, it returns '-'. Otherwise, it returns the text.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.2' and '0123456789-', we need to follow the steps of the function.

1. The function checks if chars is not empty. In this case, it is not empty.
2. It removes the characters specified in chars from the right end of the text. In this case, it removes the characters '0123456789-' from the right end of the text.
3. The resulting text is 'new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.2'.
4. The function checks if the resulting text is empty. It is not empty.
5. Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.2' and '0123456789-' is 'new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.2'.

<<<Output>>>
