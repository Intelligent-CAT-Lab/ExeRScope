The function f takes two arguments: a key and a value. It creates a dictionary with the key-value pair and then removes and returns an arbitrary element (key, value) pair from the dictionary.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'read' and 'Is', we need to create a dictionary with the key-value pair ('read', 'Is') and then remove and return an arbitrary element from the dictionary.

The output of executing the function f on the input 'read' and 'Is' is ('read', 'Is').

<<<Output>>>
('read', 'Is')
