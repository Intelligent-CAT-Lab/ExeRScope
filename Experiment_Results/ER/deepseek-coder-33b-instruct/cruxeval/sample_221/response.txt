The function f takes a string text and a delimiter as input. It splits the text into two parts at the first occurrence of the delimiter, and then returns the second part followed by the delimiter and the first part.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'bpxa24fc5.' and '.', we need to split the string 'bpxa24fc5.' at the first occurrence of '.'. The result is 'bpxa24' and 'fc5'. The function then returns 'fc5' + '.' + 'bpxa24', which is 'fc5.bpxa24'.

<<<Output>>>
'fc5.bpxa24'
