The function f takes a list of numbers as input. It starts from the second last element of the list and goes backwards. For each element, it checks if it is even. If it is, it removes the element from the list. Finally, it returns the modified list.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [5, 3, 3, 7], we need to follow the steps of the function.

1. The function starts from the second last element of the list, which is 3.
2. It checks if 3 is even. It is not, so it moves to the next element.
3. The next element is 3, which is also not even, so it moves to the next element.
4. The next element is 7, which is not even, so it moves to the next element.
5. There are no more elements in the list, so the function ends.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [5, 3, 3, 7] is [5, 3, 3, 7].

<<<Output>>>
[5, 3, 3, 7]
