The function f takes a dictionary aDict as input. It then creates a new dictionary by transposing the keys and values of the input dictionary.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input {1:1, 2:2, 3:3}, we need to transpose the keys and values of the input dictionary. Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input {1:1, 2:2, 3:3} is {1:1, 2:2, 3:3}.

<<<Output>>>
{1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 3}
