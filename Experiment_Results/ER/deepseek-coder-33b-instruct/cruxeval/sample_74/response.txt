The function f takes a list lst, an index i, and a number n as input. It inserts the number n at the index i in the list lst and then returns the modified list.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [44, 34, 23, 82, 24, 11, 63, 99], 4, 15, we need to insert the number 15 at the index 4 in the list [44, 34, 23, 82, 24, 11, 63, 99].
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [44, 34, 23, 82, 24, 11, 63, 99], 4, 15 is [44, 34, 23, 82, 15, 24, 11, 63, 99].
<<<Output>>>
[44, 34, 23, 82, 15, 24, 11, 63, 99]
