The function f takes a dictionary as input. It first adds a new key-value pair to the dictionary, where the key is 1049 and the value is 55. Then it removes the last inserted item from the dictionary and assigns its value to the key that was just removed. Finally, it returns the modified dictionary.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input {'noeohqhk': 623}, we need to follow the steps of the function.

1. Add a new key-value pair to the dictionary, where the key is 1049 and the value is 55. The dictionary becomes {'noeohqhk': 623, 1049: 55}.
2. Remove the last inserted item from the dictionary. The last inserted item is 1049: 55. The dictionary becomes {'noeohqhk': 623}.
3. Assign the value of the removed item (55) to the key that was just removed (1049). The dictionary becomes {'noeohqhk': 623, 1049: 55}.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input {'noeohqhk': 623} is {'noeohqhk': 623, 1049: 55}.

<<<Output>>>
{'noeohqhk': 623, 1049: 55}
