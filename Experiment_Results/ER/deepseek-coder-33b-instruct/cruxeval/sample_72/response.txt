The function f takes a string text as input. It then iterates over each character c in the text. If the character c is not numeric, it immediately returns False. If the function has iterated over all characters in the text without returning False, it returns the boolean value of the text.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input '99', we need to check each character in the string. The first character is '9', which is numeric, so the function continues to the next character. The second character is '9', which is numeric. The function has now iterated over all characters in the string, and since the string is not empty, it returns the boolean value of the string, which is True.
