The function f takes a string text and a string chars as input. If text is not empty, it removes the characters in chars from the right end of text using the rstrip() function. If text is empty, it simply returns text.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'ha' and '', we need to check if 'ha' is empty. Since it is not, we need to remove the characters in '' from the right end of 'ha'. However, since '' is empty, no characters are removed. Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'ha' and '' is 'ha'.

<<<Output>>>
'ha'
