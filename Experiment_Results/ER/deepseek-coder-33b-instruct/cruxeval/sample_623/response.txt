The function f takes a string text and a list of rules as input. It iterates over the rules. If a rule is '@', it reverses the text. If a rule is '~', it converts the text to uppercase. If a rule is a character that matches the last character of the text, it removes the last character from the text.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'hi~!', ['~', '`', '!', '&'], we need to follow the rules. The first rule is '~', so we convert 'hi~!', to 'HI~!'. The second rule is '`', which does not match the last character of the text, so we skip it. The third rule is '!', which matches the last character of the text, so we remove it. The fourth rule is '&', which does not match the last character of the text, so we skip it.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'hi~!', ['~', '`', '!', '&'] is 'HI'.

<<<Output>>>
'HI'
