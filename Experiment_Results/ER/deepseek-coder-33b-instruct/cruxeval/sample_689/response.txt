The function f takes an array arr as input. It first calculates the length of the array and makes a copy of it. Then it iterates over the array with a step of 2 (i.e., it starts from the first element and moves two steps at a time). For each element at an even index, it multiplies the element by 5. Finally, it returns the modified array.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [-3, -6, 2, 7], we need to follow the steps mentioned above.

1. The length of the array is 4.
2. The copy of the array is [-3, -6, 2, 7].
3. The elements at even indices (0 and 2) are multiplied by 5. So, the modified array becomes [-15, -6, 10, 7].

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [-3, -6, 2, 7] is [-15, -6, 10, 7].

<<<Output>>>
[-15, -6, 10, 7]
