The function f takes a number as input. It defines a dictionary transl with keys as alphabets and values as numbers from 1 to 5. It then initializes an empty list result.

The function then iterates over each key-value pair in the dictionary transl. For each pair, it checks if the value is divisible by the input number. If it is, it appends the key to the result list.

In this case, the input number is 2. So, it checks if the values in the dictionary transl are divisible by 2. The values 2 and 4 are divisible by 2, and their corresponding keys 'B' and 'D' are appended to the result list.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 2 is ['B', 'D'].

<<<Output>>>
['B', 'D']
