The function f takes a string as input. It first counts the number of ':' in the string. Then it replaces the last ':' in the string with an empty string.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input '1::1', we need to count the number of ':' in the string. There are two ':' in the string. Then we replace the last ':' with an empty string.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input '1::1' is '1:1'.

<<<Output>>>
'1:1'
