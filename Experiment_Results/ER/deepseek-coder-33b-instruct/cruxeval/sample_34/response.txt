The function f takes a list of numbers nums and two odd numbers odd1 and odd2 as input. It removes all occurrences of odd1 and odd2 from the list nums. The function then returns the modified list nums.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 2, 3, 7, 7, 6, 8, 4, 1, 2, 3, 5, 1, 3, 21, 1, 3], 3, 1, the function will remove all occurrences of 3 and 1 from the list.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 2, 3, 7, 7, 6, 8, 4, 1, 2, 3, 5, 1, 3, 21, 1, 3], 3, 1 is [2, 7, 7, 6, 8, 4, 2, 5, 3, 21, 3].

<<<Output>>>
[2, 7, 7, 6, 8, 4, 2, 5, 3, 21, 3]
