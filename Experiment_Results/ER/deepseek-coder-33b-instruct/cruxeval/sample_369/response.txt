The function f takes a string var as input. It checks if var is a digit, a float, a string, a character, or a tuple.

The input " 99 777" is a string. It contains spaces, but not all characters are spaces. Therefore, it is not a digit, a float, a character, or a tuple. It is a string.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input " 99 777", we need to check if it is a digit, a float, a string, a character, or a tuple.

The input " 99 777" is not a digit, a float, a character, or a tuple. Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input " 99 777" is "str".

<<<Output>>>
