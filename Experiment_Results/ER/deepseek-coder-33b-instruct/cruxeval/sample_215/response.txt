The function f takes a string text as input. It initializes a new string new_text with the same value as text. Then it enters a while loop that continues as long as the length of text is greater than 1 and the first character of text is the same as the last character.

In each iteration of the loop, it updates the value of text to be the substring of text that excludes the first and last characters. It also updates the value of new_text to be the same as text.

The loop will continue until either the length of text is 1 or the first and last characters of text are different.

The function then returns the value of new_text.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input ')', we need to follow the steps of the function.

First, it initializes new_text to be ')'. Then it checks if the length of ')' is greater than 1 and the first character of ')' is the same as the last character. It is not, so the loop does not execute.

Finally, it returns the value of new_text, which is ')'.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input ')' is ')'.

<<<Output>>>
