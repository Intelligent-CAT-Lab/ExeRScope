The function f takes two arrays as input, arr1 and arr2. It first makes a copy of arr1 and stores it in new_arr. Then it extends new_arr with arr2. Finally, it returns new_arr.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [5, 1, 3, 7, 8] and ['', 0, -1, []], we need to follow the steps of the function:

1. Make a copy of arr1 and store it in new_arr. new_arr is now [5, 1, 3, 7, 8].
2. Extend new_arr with arr2. new_arr is now [5, 1, 3, 7, 8, '', 0, -1, []].
3. Return new_arr.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [5, 1, 3, 7, 8] and ['', 0, -1, []] is [5, 1, 3, 7, 8, '', 0, -1, []].

<<<Output>>>
[5, 1, 3, 7, 8, '', 0, -1, []]
