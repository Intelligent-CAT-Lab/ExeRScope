The function f takes a list of lists as input. It then iterates over each list in the input list. For each list, it extends the list with the string "+353". After that, it joins all elements of the list with a semicolon (;) and appends the resulting string to the result list. Finally, it joins all strings in the result list with a dot followed by a space (. ) and returns the resulting string.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [['Marie','Nelson','Oscar']], we need to follow the steps of the function.

1. The input list is [['Marie','Nelson','Oscar']].
2. For the first list in the input list, ['Marie','Nelson','Oscar'], it extends the list with the string "+353". The result is ['Marie','Nelson','Oscar','+353'].
3. It then joins all elements of the list with a semicolon (;) and appends the resulting string to the result list. The result list becomes ['Marie;Nelson;Oscar;+353'].
4. Since there is only one list in the input list, the function returns the only string in the result list, 'Marie;Nelson;Oscar;+353'.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [['Marie','Nelson','Oscar']] is 'Marie;Nelson;Oscar;+353'.

<<<Output>>>
'Marie;Nelson;Oscar;+353'
