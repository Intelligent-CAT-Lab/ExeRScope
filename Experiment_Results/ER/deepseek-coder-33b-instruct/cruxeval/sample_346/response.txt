The function f takes a filename as input. It splits the filename into two parts based on the '.' character. The last part of the split is the file extension. It then reverses the file extension and appends it to the original filename. Finally, it checks if the new filename ends with the original file extension.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'docs.doc', we need to follow the steps of the function:
1. Split 'docs.doc' into 'docs' and 'doc'. The file extension is 'doc'.
2. Reverse 'doc' to get 'cod'.
3. Append 'cod' to 'docs.doc' to get 'docs.doccod'.
4. Check if 'docs.doccod' ends with 'doc'. It does not, so the function returns False.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'docs.doc' is False.

<<<Output>>>
