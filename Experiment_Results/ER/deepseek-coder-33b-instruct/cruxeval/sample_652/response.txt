The function f takes a string as input. It first checks if the string is empty or the first character of the string is not numeric. If either of these conditions is true, it returns 'INVALID'.

Next, it initializes a variable cur to 0. Then it iterates over each character in the string. For each character, it multiplies the current value of cur by 10 and adds the integer value of the current character to cur.

When the function is called with the input '3', it checks if the string is empty or the first character is not numeric. In this case, the string is not empty and the first character is numeric, so it proceeds to the next step.

The function then iterates over each character in the string. For the first character '3', it multiplies cur by 10 (which is 0) and adds the integer value of '3' (which is 3), so cur becomes 3.

Since the string only has one character, the loop ends and the function returns the string representation of cur, which is '3'.

<<<Output>>>
'3'
