The function f takes two lists a and b as input. It first creates a dictionary d from the two lists a and b using the zip function. Then it sorts the list a based on the values in the dictionary d in descending order. Finally, it returns a list of values from the dictionary d corresponding to the elements in the sorted list a.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input ['12','ab'], [2,2], we need to follow the steps:
1. Create a dictionary d from the two lists ['12','ab'] and [2,2] using the zip function. The dictionary d will be {'12': 2, 'ab': 2}.
2. Sort the list ['12','ab'] based on the values in the dictionary d in descending order. The sorted list will be ['12','ab'].
3. Return a list of values from the dictionary d corresponding to the elements in the sorted list ['12','ab']. The values corresponding to '12' and 'ab' in the dictionary d are 2 and 2 respectively.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input ['12','ab'], [2,2] is [2, 2].

<<<Output>>>
