The function f takes a string s and a separator sep as input. It finds the index of the first occurrence of the separator in the string s. It then separates the string s into three parts: a prefix, middle, and right_str. The prefix is the part of the string before the separator, the middle is the separator itself, and the right_str is the part of the string after the separator. The function then returns these three parts.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "not it" and "" (empty string), we need to find the index of the separator in the string "not it". Since the separator is an empty string, it is not found in the string "not it". Therefore, the prefix is the entire string "not it", the middle is an empty string, and the right_str is also an empty string.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "not it" and "" is ("not it", "", "").

<<<Output>>>
('not it', '', '')
