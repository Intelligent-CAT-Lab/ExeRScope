The function f takes a string sb as input and initializes an empty dictionary d. It then iterates over each character in the string. For each character, it checks if the character is already a key in the dictionary d. If it is, it increments the value associated with that key by 1. If it is not, it adds the character as a key to the dictionary with a value of 1. Finally, it returns the dictionary d.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'meow meow', we need to count the number of occurrences of each character in the string. Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'meow meow' is {'m': 2, 'e': 2, 'o': 2, 'w': 1, ' ': 1}.

<<<Output>>>
{'m': 2, 'e': 2, 'o': 2, 'w': 1, ' ': 1}
