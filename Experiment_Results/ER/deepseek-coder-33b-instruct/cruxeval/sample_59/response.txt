The function f takes a string s as input. It first creates a list a by iterating over each character in s and adding it to the list if it is not a space. Then it makes b a reference to a. It then iterates over the reversed list a. If it encounters a space, it removes the last element from b. If it encounters a non-space character, it breaks the loop. Finally, it joins all the characters in b into a string and returns it.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'hi ', it first creates a list a with the characters 'h', 'i', and ' '. Then it makes b a reference to a. It then iterates over the reversed list a. It encounters a space, so it removes the last element from b. It then encounters a non-space character, so it breaks the loop. Finally, it joins all the characters in b into a string and returns it.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'hi ' is 'hi'.

<<<Output>>>
