The function f takes a list of strings and a substring as input. It filters the list to include only those strings that start with the substring, then sorts the resulting list by string length.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input ['condor', 'eyes', 'gay', 'isa' ], 'd', we first filter the list to include only those strings that start with 'd', which gives us an empty list. Then we sort this list by string length, which gives us an empty list.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input ['condor', 'eyes', 'gay', 'isa' ], 'd' is an empty list.
