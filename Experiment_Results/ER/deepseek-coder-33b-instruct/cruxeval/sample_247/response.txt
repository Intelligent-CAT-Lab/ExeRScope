The function f takes a string s as input. It first checks if all the characters in the string s are alphabets using the isalpha() method. If they are, it returns "yes". If not, it checks if the string s is empty. If it is, it returns "str is empty". If the string s is not empty and does not contain only alphabets, it returns "no".

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'Boolean', we need to check the conditions in the function. The string 'Boolean' contains non-alphabet characters, so it does not satisfy the first condition. It is also not an empty string, so it does not satisfy the second condition. Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'Boolean' is "no".

<<<Output>>>
'no'
