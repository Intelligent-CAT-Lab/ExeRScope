The function f takes a string text and a character ch as input. It splits the text into lines, checks each line if it is not empty and if the first character of the line is equal to the character ch. If the condition is true, it converts the line to lowercase and appends it to the result list. If the condition is false, it converts the line to uppercase and appends it to the result list. Finally, it joins all the lines in the result list with a newline character and returns the resulting string.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "t\nza\na" and "t", we need to follow the steps of the function.

1. The text "t\nza\na" is split into lines ["t", "za", "a"].
2. For the first line "t", the first character is "t" which is equal to "t". So, the line is converted to lowercase and appended to the result list.
3. For the second line "za", the first character is "z" which is not equal to "t". So, the line is converted to uppercase and appended to the result list.
4. For the third line "a", the first character is "a" which is not equal to "t". So, the line is converted to uppercase and appended to the result list.
5. The lines in the result list are joined with a newline character to form the final string.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "t\nza\na" and "t" is "t\nZA\nA".

<<<Output>>>
't\nZA\nA'
