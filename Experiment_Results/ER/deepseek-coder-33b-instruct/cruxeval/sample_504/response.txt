The function f takes a list of values as input. It sorts the list in ascending order and then returns the sorted list.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 1, 1, 1], we need to sort the list [1, 1, 1, 1] in ascending order. Since the list is already sorted, the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 1, 1, 1] is [1, 1, 1, 1].
<<<Output>>>
[1, 1, 1, 1]
