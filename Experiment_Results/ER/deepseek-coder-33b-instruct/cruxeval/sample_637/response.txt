The function f takes a string text as input. It splits the text into a list of words using the split() method. Then it iterates over each word in the list. If the word is not numeric (checked using the isnumeric() method), it returns 'no'. If the function has not returned 'no' after checking all words, it returns 'yes'.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input '03625163633 d', it splits the input into the words '03625163633' and 'd'. It checks if '03625163633' is numeric, which it is. Then it checks if 'd' is numeric, which it is not. Since 'd' is not numeric, the function returns 'no'.

<<<Output>>>
'no'
