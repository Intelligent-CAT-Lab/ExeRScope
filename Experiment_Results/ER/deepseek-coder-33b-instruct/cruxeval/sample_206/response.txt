The function f takes a string a as input. It first splits the string a into a list of words using the split() function. The split() function splits the string at each space character, removing any leading or trailing spaces.

Then, it joins the list of words back into a string using the join() function. The join() function concatenates the list of words into a single string, with a space character between each word.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input ' h e l l o   w o r l d! ', we need to split the string into words and then join them back together with a space character between each word.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input ' h e l l o   w o r l d! ' is 'h e l l o w o r l d!'.

<<<Output>>>
'h e l l o w o r l d!'
