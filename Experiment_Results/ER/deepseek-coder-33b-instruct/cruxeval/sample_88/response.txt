The function f takes two strings s1 and s2 as input. It checks if s2 ends with s1. If it does, it removes the last len(s1) characters from s2. Finally, it returns s2.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "he" and "hello", we need to check if "hello" ends with "he". It does, so we remove the last 2 characters from "hello", which gives us "hel".

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "he" and "hello" is "hel".

<<<Output>>>
'hel'
