The function f takes a list and a number as input. It initializes an empty list temp. Then it iterates over each element in the input list. For each element, it performs an integer division of the input number by 2 and then multiplies the result with the string representation of the element. This operation is done using the '%s,' format specifier. The result is then appended to the temp list. Finally, the function returns the temp list.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input ['v'], 1, we need to follow the steps outlined above.

For the first iteration, the element is 'v' and the number is 1. The integer division of 1 by 2 is 0. Therefore, the result of the multiplication is ''. This is then appended to the temp list.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input ['v'], 1 is [''].
