The function f takes a list of strings values and a value as input. It first calculates the length of the list values. Then it creates a new dictionary new_dict from the list values, where each key is a value from the list and the corresponding value is the input value. After that, it adds a new key-value pair to the dictionary. The key is the sorted version of the list values joined into a string, and the value is the input value multiplied by 3. Finally, it returns the new dictionary.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input ['0','3'] and 117, we need to follow the steps of the function.

First, the length of the list ['0','3'] is 2. Then, a new dictionary is created from the list ['0','3'], where each key is a value from the list and the corresponding value is 117. The new dictionary is {'0': 117, '3': 117}.

Next, a new key-value pair is added to the dictionary. The key is the sorted version of the list ['0','3'] joined into a string, which is '03'. The value is the input value 117 multiplied by 3, which is 351. So, the new dictionary becomes {'0': 117, '3': 117, '03': 351}.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input ['0','3'] and 117 is {'0': 117, '3': 117, '03': 351}.

<<<Output>>>
{'0': 117, '3': 117, '03': 351}
