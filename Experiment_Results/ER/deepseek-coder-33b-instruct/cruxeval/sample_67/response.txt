The function f takes three numbers as input, num1, num2, and num3. It creates a list nums with these numbers. Then it sorts the list in ascending order. Finally, it returns a string with the sorted numbers separated by commas.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 6, 8, and 8, we first create the list [6, 8, 8]. Then we sort the list to get [6, 8, 8]. Finally, we return the string '6,8,8'.

<<<Output>>>
'6,8,8'
