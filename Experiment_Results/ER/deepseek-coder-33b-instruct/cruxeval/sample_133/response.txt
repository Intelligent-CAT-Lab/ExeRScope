The function f takes a list of numbers nums and a list of elements as input. It initializes an empty list result. Then it enters a loop that runs for the length of the elements list. In each iteration, it pops the last element from nums and appends it to result. After the loop, it returns nums.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [7, 1, 2, 6, 0, 2] and [9, 0, 3], we need to follow the steps of the function.

1. Initialize result as an empty list.
2. Start a loop that runs for the length of the elements list.
3. In each iteration, pop the last element from nums and append it to result.
4. After the loop, return nums.

So, the output of executing the function f on the input [7, 1, 2, 6, 0, 2] and [9, 0, 3] is [7, 1, 2, 6, 0].

<<<Output>>>
[7, 1, 2, 6, 0]
