The function f takes a variable var as input. It first checks if var is a list. If it is, it calculates the length of the list and assigns it to the variable amount. If var is not a list, it assigns 0 to amount.

Next, it checks if var is a dictionary. If it is, it calculates the number of keys in the dictionary and assigns it to the variable amount.

Finally, it checks if amount is greater than 0. If it is, it assigns amount to the variable nonzero. If it is not, it assigns 0 to nonzero.

The function then returns nonzero.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 1, we first check if 1 is a list. It is not, so amount is 0. Then we check if 1 is a dictionary. It is not, so amount remains 0.

Finally, we check if amount is greater than 0. It is not, so nonzero is 0.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 1 is 0.
