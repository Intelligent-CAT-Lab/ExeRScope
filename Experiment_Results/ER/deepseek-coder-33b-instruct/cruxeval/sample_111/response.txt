The function f takes a dictionary marks as input. It initializes two variables, highest and lowest, to 0 and 100 respectively. Then it iterates over the values of the dictionary. For each value, it checks if the value is greater than the current highest value. If it is, it updates the highest value. Similarly, it checks if the value is less than the current lowest value. If it is, it updates the lowest value. Finally, it returns a tuple containing the highest and lowest values.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input {'x': 67, 'v': 89, '': 4, 'alij': 11, 'kgfsd': 72, 'yafby': 83}, the function will iterate over the values of the dictionary. The highest value will be updated to 89 and the lowest value will be updated to 4. Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input {'x': 67, 'v': 89, '': 4, 'alij': 11, 'kgfsd': 72, 'yafby': 83} is (89, 4).

<<<Output>>>
