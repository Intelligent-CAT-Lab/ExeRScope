The function f takes a string text as input. It initializes an empty string result. Then it iterates over the input string in reverse order (from the last character to the first). For each character, it appends it to the result string. Finally, it returns the result string.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'was,', we need to reverse the order of the characters in the string. Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'was,' is ',saw'.

<<<Output>>>
',saw'
