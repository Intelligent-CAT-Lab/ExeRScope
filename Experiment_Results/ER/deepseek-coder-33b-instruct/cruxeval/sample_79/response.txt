The function f takes an array arr as input. It first converts the input array into a list. Then it clears the list. After that, it appends the strings '1', '2', '3', and '4' to the list. Finally, it joins the elements of the list with a comma and returns the resulting string.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [0, 1, 2, 3, 4], we need to follow the steps outlined in the function.

1. The input array [0, 1, 2, 3, 4] is converted into a list.
2. The list is then cleared, leaving it empty.
3. The strings '1', '2', '3', and '4' are then appended to the list.
4. The elements of the list are then joined with a comma, resulting in the string '1,2,3,4'.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [0, 1, 2, 3, 4] is '1,2,3,4'.

<<<Output>>>
'1,2,3,4'
