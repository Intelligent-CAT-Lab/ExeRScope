The function f takes a list arr as input. It first reverses the list using the reversed function and then converts the reversed object to a list. The output of the function is the reversed list.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [2, 0, 1, 9999, 3, -5], we need to reverse the list [2, 0, 1, 9999, 3, -5]. Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [2, 0, 1, 9999, 3, -5] is [ -5, 3, 9999, 1, 0, 2].

<<<Output>>>
[-5, 3, 9999, 1, 0, 2]
