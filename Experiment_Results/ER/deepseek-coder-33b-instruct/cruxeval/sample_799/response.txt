The function f takes a string st as input. If the first character of st is '~', it adds 's' to the left of st until the length of st becomes 10. Then it calls itself with the new string e. If the first character of st is not '~', it adds 'n' to the left of st until the length of st becomes 10.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'eqe-;ew22', we need to analyze the code step by step.

First, the first character of 'eqe-;ew22' is not '~', so it adds 'n' to the left of 'eqe-;ew22' until the length of 'eqe-;ew22' becomes 10.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'eqe-;ew22' is 'nnnnnnnneqe-;ew22'.

<<<Output>>>
'nnnnnnnneqe-;ew22'
