The function f takes a list of years as input. It first counts the number of years that are less than or equal to 1900 and assigns it to the variable a10. It then counts the number of years that are greater than 1910 and assigns it to the variable a90. If a10 is greater than 3, it returns 3. If a90 is greater than 3, it returns 1. Otherwise, it returns 2.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1872, 1995, 1945], we need to count the number of years that are less than or equal to 1900 and the number of years that are greater than 1910.

In the list [1872, 1995, 1945], there is 1 year that is less than or equal to 1900 (1872) and 2 years that are greater than 1910 (1995 and 1945). Since a10 (1) is not greater than 3, the function does not return 3. Since a90 (2) is not greater than 3, the function does not return 1. Therefore, the function returns 2.
