The function f takes a string text as input. It initializes a variable s to 0. Then it enters a for loop that iterates over the range from 1 to the length of the text. For each iteration, it partitions the text at the current character and adds the length of the first partition (which is all the characters before the current character) to s. Finally, it returns s.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'wdj', we need to follow the steps of the function.

For i = 1, the partition is at 'w' and the first partition is '', so len('') = 0.
For i = 2, the partition is at 'd' and the first partition is 'w', so len('w') = 1.

So, s = 0 + 1 = 1.

For i = 3, the partition is at 'j' and the first partition is 'wd', so len('wd') = 2.

So, s = 1 + 2 = 3.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'wdj' is 3.
