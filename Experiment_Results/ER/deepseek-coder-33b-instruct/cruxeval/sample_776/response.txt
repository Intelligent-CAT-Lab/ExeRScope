The function f takes a dictionary as input. It first makes a copy of the dictionary. Then it iterates over the keys in the copied dictionary. If the key is an odd number, it deletes the key-value pair from the dictionary and adds a new key-value pair to the dictionary where the key is the string '$' concatenated with the original key and the value is the original value. Finally, it returns the modified dictionary.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input {}, we need to follow the steps of the function. Since the input dictionary is empty, the function will return an empty dictionary as well.
