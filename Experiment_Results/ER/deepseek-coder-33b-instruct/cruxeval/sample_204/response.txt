The function f takes a string name as input. It returns a list with two elements. The first element is the first character of the input string, and the second element is the last character of the second part of the input string (after the dot) reversed.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "master. ", we need to follow the steps:
1. The first element of the output list is the first character of the input string, which is "m".
2. The second part of the input string after the dot is "aster ", reversed is "retsa".
3. The second element of the output list is the first character of the reversed string, which is "r".

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "master. " is ['m', 'r'].

<<<Output>>>
['m', 'r']
