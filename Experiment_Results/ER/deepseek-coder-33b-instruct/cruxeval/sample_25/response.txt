The function f takes a dictionary d as input. It first makes a copy of the dictionary d using the copy() method. Then it removes the last inserted key-value pair from the copied dictionary using the popitem() method. The popitem() method removes the last inserted pair. Finally, it returns the modified dictionary.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input {"l": 1, "t": 2, "x:": 3}, we need to follow the steps mentioned above.

First, a copy of the dictionary {"l": 1, "t": 2, "x:": 3} is made.
Then, the last inserted pair {"x:": 3} is removed from the copied dictionary.
Finally, the modified dictionary {"l": 1, "t": 2} is returned.

<<<Output>>>
{'l': 1, 't': 2}
