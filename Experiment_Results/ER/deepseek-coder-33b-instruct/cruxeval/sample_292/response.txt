The function f takes a string text as input. It then creates a new list new_text where each character in text is either the character itself if it is a digit, or '*' if it is not a digit. Finally, it joins all the characters in new_text into a single string and returns this string.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input '5f83u23saa', we need to follow the steps of the function:

1. For each character in '5f83u23saa', if it is a digit, keep it as is. If it is not a digit, replace it with '*'.
2. The resulting list of characters is ['5', '*', '*', '*', '*', '*', '*', '*', '*', '*'].
3. Join all the characters in the list into a single string, resulting in '5*********'.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input '5f83u23saa' is '5*********'.

<<<Output>>>
'5*********'
