The function f takes three parameters: n, m, and text. It checks if the text is empty or not. If it's not empty, it separates the text into three parts: head, mid, and tail. The head is the first character of the text, the mid is the characters in the middle of the text (excluding the first and last characters), and the tail is the last character of the text.

Then, it replaces all occurrences of n in the head, mid, and tail with m. The replaced strings are then concatenated together.

For the input `f("x", "$", "2xz&5H3*1a@#a*1hris")`, the function first checks if the text is empty or not. In this case, the text is not empty, so it proceeds to the next step.

The head of the text is "2", the mid of the text is "xz&5H3*1a@#a*1hri", and the tail of the text is "s".

The function then replaces all occurrences of "x" in the head, mid, and tail with "$". The replaced strings are then concatenated together.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "2xz&5H3*1a@#a*1hris" is "2$z&5H3*1$@#$*1hris".

<<<Output>>>
'2$z&5H3*1$@#$*1hris'
