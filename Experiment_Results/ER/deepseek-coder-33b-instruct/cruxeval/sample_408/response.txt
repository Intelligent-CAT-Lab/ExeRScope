The function f takes a list m as input. It reverses the order of elements in the list and then returns the reversed list.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [-4, 6, 0, 4, -7, 2, -1], we need to reverse the order of elements in the list.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [-4, 6, 0, 4, -7, 2, -1] is [2, -1, -7, 4, 0, 6, -4].
<<<Output>>>
[2, -1, -7, 4, 0, 6, -4]
