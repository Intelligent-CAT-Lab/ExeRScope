The function f takes a string text as input. It first removes all hyphens from the text and converts the text to lowercase. Then it iterates over each character in the text. For each character, it checks if the character is already in the dictionary d. If it is, it increments the count of that character by 1. If it is not, it adds the character to the dictionary with a count of 1. After that, it sorts the dictionary items by their count and returns a list of the counts.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "x--y-z-5-C", we need to follow the steps mentioned above.

1. Remove hyphens from the text and convert the text to lowercase. The result is "xyz5c".
2. Iterate over each character in the text. For each character, check if the character is already in the dictionary d. If it is, increment the count of that character by 1. If it is not, add the character to the dictionary with a count of 1.
3. After iterating over all characters, the dictionary d will be {'x': 1, 'y': 1, 'z': 1, '5': 1, 'c': 1}.
4. Sort the dictionary items by their count. The sorted dictionary is [('x', 1), ('y', 1), ('z', 1), ('5', 1), ('c', 1)].
5. Return a list of the counts from the sorted dictionary. The result is [1, 1, 1, 1, 1].

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "x--y-z-5-C" is [1, 1, 1, 1, 1].

<<<Output>>>
[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
