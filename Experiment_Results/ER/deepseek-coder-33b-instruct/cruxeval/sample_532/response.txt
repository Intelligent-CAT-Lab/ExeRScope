The function f takes an integer n and a list array as input. It creates a list final that initially contains a copy of the input array. Then, it enters a loop that runs n times. In each iteration of the loop, it creates a copy of the input array, extends this copy with the last element of final (which is the copy of the input array), and appends this extended array to final. Finally, it returns final.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input (1, [1, 2, 3]), we need to follow the steps of the function.

First, it creates a list final that initially contains a copy of the input array, which is [1, 2, 3].

Then, it enters a loop that runs once. In the first iteration of the loop, it creates a copy of the input array, which is [1, 2, 3], extends this copy with the last element of final (which is [1, 2, 3]), and appends this extended array to final. So, final becomes [[1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]].

Finally, it returns final.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input (1, [1, 2, 3]) is [[1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]].

<<<Output>>>
[[1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]]
