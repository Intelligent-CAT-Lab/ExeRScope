The function f takes an array and an element as input. It first reverses the array, then tries to find the index of the element in the reversed array. If the element is found, it returns the index. If the element is not found, it raises an exception. After the try-finally block, it reverses the array back to its original order.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [5, -3, 3, 2] and 2, we need to follow the steps of the function.

1. The array [5, -3, 3, 2] is reversed to [2, 3, -3, 5].
2. The element 2 is found at index 3 in the reversed array.
3. The array is reversed back to [2, 3, -3, 5].

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [5, -3, 3, 2] and 2 is 3.
