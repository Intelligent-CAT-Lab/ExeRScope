The function f takes a string s as input. It initializes two empty strings b and c. Then it iterates over each character in the string s. For each character, it appends the character to c and checks if c is a substring of s. If it is, it returns the index of the last occurrence of c in s. If no such substring is found, it returns 0.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'papeluchis', we need to follow the steps in the function.

1. Initialize b and c as empty strings.
2. Iterate over each character in the string 'papeluchis'.
3. Append each character to c.
4. Check if c is a substring of 'papeluchis'.
5. If c is a substring, return the index of the last occurrence of c in 'papeluchis'.

In this case, the function will return 5, which is the index of the last occurrence of 'pape' in 'papeluchis'.

<<<Output>>>
