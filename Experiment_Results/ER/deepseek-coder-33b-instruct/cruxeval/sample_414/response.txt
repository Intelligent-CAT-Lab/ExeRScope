The function f takes a dictionary d as input. It first makes a copy of the dictionary d. Then it iterates over each key-value pair in the copied dictionary. For each value (which is a list), it converts each string in the list to uppercase. Finally, it returns the modified dictionary.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input {'X': ['x', 'y']}, we need to follow the steps outlined in the function.

1. First, it makes a copy of the input dictionary {'X': ['x', 'y']}.
2. Then, it iterates over each key-value pair in the copied dictionary. The key is 'X' and the value is the list ['x', 'y'].
3. For each value (which is a list), it converts each string in the list to uppercase. So, 'x' becomes 'X' and 'y' becomes 'Y'.
4. Finally, it returns the modified dictionary {'X': ['X', 'Y']}.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input {'X': ['x', 'y']} is {'X': ['X', 'Y']}.

<<<Output>>>
{'X': ['X', 'Y']}
