The function f takes a string postcode as input. It uses the index method to find the first occurrence of 'C' in the string. The index method returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified value. The [postcode.index('C'):] slice operation then returns a substring from the index of 'C' to the end of the string.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'ED20 CW', we need to find the index of 'C' in the string 'ED20 CW'. The index of 'C' is 5. Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'ED20 CW' is ' CW'.

<<<Output>>>
' CW'
