The function f takes a list lst as input. It first clears the list using the clear() method. Then it iterates over the list. If it finds the number 3 in the list, it returns False. If it doesn't find the number 3 in the list, it returns True.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [2, 0], it first clears the list, making it an empty list. Then it iterates over the list, but since the list is empty, it doesn't find the number 3. Therefore, it returns True.

<<<Output>>>
