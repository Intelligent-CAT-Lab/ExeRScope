The function f takes a string text as input. It first splits the text into lines using the splitlines() method, which splits the string at line breaks. Then it joins the resulting list of lines into a string, separating each line with a comma and a space.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "BYE\nNO\nWAY", we need to split the string at the line breaks and then join the resulting list of lines with a comma and a space.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "BYE\nNO\nWAY" is "BYE, NO, WAY".

<<<Output>>>
'BYE, NO, WAY'
