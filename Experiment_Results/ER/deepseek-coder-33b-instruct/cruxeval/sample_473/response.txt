The function f takes a string text and a character value as input. It first creates an empty list indexes. Then it iterates over the string text and if it finds the character value in the string, it appends the index of that character to the list indexes. After that, it converts the string text into a list new_text. Then it iterates over the list indexes and removes the character value from the list new_text. Finally, it joins the list new_text into a string and returns it.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'scedvtvotkwqfoqn' and 'o', we need to follow the steps mentioned above.

First, it creates an empty list indexes. Then it iterates over the string 'scedvtvotkwqfoqn' and if it finds the character 'o' in the string, it appends the index of that character to the list indexes. In this case, the index of 'o' in the string 'scedvtvotkwqfoqn' is 10 and 14.

After that, it converts the string 'scedvtvotkwqfoqn' into a list new_text. Then it iterates over the list indexes and removes the character 'o' from the list new_text. In this case, it removes 'o' from the list new_text at index 14 first and then at index 10.

Finally, it joins the list new_text into a string and returns it. In this case, the string 'scedvtvotkwqfoqn' becomes 'scedvtvtvkwqfn' after removing 'o' from it.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'scedvtvotkwqfoqn' and 'o' is 'scedvtvtvkwqfn'.

<<<Output>>>
'scedvtvtvkwqfn'
