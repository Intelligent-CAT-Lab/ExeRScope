The function f takes two arguments: a list total and arg. If arg is a list, it extends the list total with each element of arg. If arg is not a list, it extends the list total with arg.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input ```([1, 2, 3], 'nammo')```, we need to follow the steps of the function.

1. The function checks if arg is a list. In this case, 'nammo' is not a list.
2. Since arg is not a list, the function extends the list total with arg.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input ```([1, 2, 3], 'nammo')``` is ```[1, 2, 3, 'nammo']```.

<<<Output>>>
[1, 2, 3, 'nammo']
