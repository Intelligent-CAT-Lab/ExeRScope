The function f takes a list of numbers nums and a target number as input. It first counts the number of times the target number appears in the list nums. Then it multiplies this count by 2 and returns the result.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 1] and 1, we first count the number of times 1 appears in the list [1, 1]. There are 2 instances of 1 in the list. Then we multiply this count by 2 to get 4.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 1] and 1 is 4.
