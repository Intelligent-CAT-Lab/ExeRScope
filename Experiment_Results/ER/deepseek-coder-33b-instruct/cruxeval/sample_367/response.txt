The function f takes a list of numbers and a value to remove as input. It creates a copy of the input list and then enters a loop that continues until the value to remove is not found in the list. In each iteration of the loop, it removes the first occurrence of the value to remove from the list and appends it to the end of the list. The loop continues until all occurrences of the value to remove are removed from the list. The function then returns the modified list.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input ```f([6, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1], 5)```, we need to remove all occurrences of 5 from the list [6, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1]. However, 5 is not in the list, so the list remains unchanged.

<<<Output>>>
[6, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1]
