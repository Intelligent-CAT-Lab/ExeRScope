The function f takes a string text and a separator sep as input. It uses the rsplit() function to split the text from the right, using the separator as the delimiter. The maxsplit parameter is set to 2, which means the function will split the text at most 2 times.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "a-.-.b" and "-.", we need to split the string "a-.-.b" from the right using the separator "-.". The maxsplit parameter is set to 2, so the function will split the string at most 2 times.

The output of executing the function f on the input "a-.-.b" and "-." is ['a-.-', 'b'].

<<<Output>>>
['a-.-', 'b']
