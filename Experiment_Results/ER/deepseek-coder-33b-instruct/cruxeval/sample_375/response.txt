The function f takes two strings a and b as input. It checks if b is in a. If b is in a, it partitions a at the index of the next character of b, joins b with the partitioned string, and returns the result. If b is not in a, it returns a.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'sierizam' and 'iz', we need to check if 'iz' is in 'sierizam'. It is, so we partition 'sierizam' at the index of the next character of 'iz', which is 'r'. We then join 'iz' with the partitioned string, which is 'sierizam'.split('r') = ['sie', 'zam'].join('iz') = 'sizam'.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'sierizam' and 'iz' is 'sizam'.

<<<Output>>>
'sizam'
