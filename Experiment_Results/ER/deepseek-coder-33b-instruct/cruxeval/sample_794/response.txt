The function f takes a string line as input. It initializes an empty list a. Then it iterates over each character c in the line. If the character c is alphanumeric (i.e., a letter or a number), it appends c to the list a. Finally, it joins all the characters in the list a into a string and returns it.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "\"\\%$ normal chars $%~ qwet42'", we need to consider each character in the string. The characters that are not alphanumeric are "\\%$", "$%~", and "'" (the single quote). The alphanumeric characters are "normal", "chars", "qwet", and "42". So, the output of executing the function f on the input "\"\\%$ normal chars $%~ qwet42'" is "normalcharsqwet42".

<<<Output>>>
'normalcharsqwet42'
