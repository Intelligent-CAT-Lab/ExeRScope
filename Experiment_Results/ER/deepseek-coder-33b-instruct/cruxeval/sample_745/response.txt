The function f takes an email address as input. It first finds the position of '@' in the address and adds 1 to it to get the starting position of the domain suffix. Then it checks if the domain suffix contains more than one '.'. If it does, it removes the last two parts of the domain suffix from the address. Finally, it returns the modified address.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'minimc@minimc.io', we need to follow the steps mentioned above.

1. The position of '@' in 'minimc@minimc.io' is 6. So, suffix_start is 7.
2. The domain suffix of 'minimc@minimc.io' is 'minimc.io'. It contains only one '.'. So, the condition in the if statement is not satisfied.
3. The function returns the input address 'minimc@minimc.io' as it is.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'minimc@minimc.io' is 'minimc@minimc.io'.

<<<Output>>>
'minimc@minimc.io'
