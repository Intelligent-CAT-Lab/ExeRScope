The function f takes three parameters: a string text, a string fill, and an integer size. If the size is less than 0, it changes the size to its absolute value. If the length of the text is greater than the size, it returns the last size characters of the text. Otherwise, it pads the text to the right with the fill character to make it size characters long.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'no asw', 'j', 1, we first change the size to its absolute value, which is 1. Then, since the length of 'no asw' is not greater than 1, it pads 'no asw' to the right with 'j' to make it 1 character long.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'no asw', 'j', 1 is 'j'.

<<<Output>>>
'j'
