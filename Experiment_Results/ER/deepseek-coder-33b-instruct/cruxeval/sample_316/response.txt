The function f takes a string name as input. It first splits the input string into a list of words using the split() function. Then it joins the words in the list with a space in between using the join() function. It adds a '|' at the beginning and end of the string.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'i am your father', we need to follow the steps:
1. Split the input string 'i am your father' into a list of words: ['i', 'am', 'your', 'father']
2. Join the words in the list with a space in between: 'i am your father'
3. Add a '|' at the beginning and end of the string: '| i am your father |'

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'i am your father' is '| i am your father |'.

<<<Output>>>
'| i am your father |'
