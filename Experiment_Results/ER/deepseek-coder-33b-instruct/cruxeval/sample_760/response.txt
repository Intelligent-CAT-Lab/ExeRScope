The function f takes a dictionary d as input. It initializes an empty list l. Then it enters a while loop that continues until the dictionary d is empty. In each iteration of the loop, it pops an item from the dictionary and appends its key to the list l. Finally, it returns the list l.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input ```dict(f = 1, h = 2, j = 3, k = 4)```, we need to follow the steps of the function.

1. Initialize an empty list l.
2. Enter the while loop. The dictionary d initially has 4 items, so the loop will iterate 4 times.
3. In each iteration, pop an item from the dictionary and append its key to the list l. The order of the keys in the dictionary is not guaranteed, so the order of the keys in the list l will also be random.
4. After the loop, return the list l.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input ```dict(f = 1, h = 2, j = 3, k = 4)``` will be a list of the keys of the input dictionary, in an arbitrary order.

<<<Output>>>
['f', 'h', 'j', 'k']
