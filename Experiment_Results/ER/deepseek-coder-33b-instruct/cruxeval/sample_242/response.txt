The function `f` takes a string `book` as input. It splits the string `book` into two parts at the last occurrence of `:` using `rsplit(':', 1)`. The first part is stored in `a[0]` and the second part is stored in `a[1]`.

Then it checks if the last word of the first part (`a[0].split(' ')[-1]`) is the same as the first word of the second part (`a[1].split(' ')[0]`). If they are the same, it removes the last word from the first part, joins it with the second part, and calls itself with the new string.

If the last word of the first part is not the same as the first word of the second part, it simply returns the original `book`.

To determine the output of executing the function `f` on the input "udhv zcvi nhtnfyd :erwuyawa pun", we need to follow the steps of the function.

First, it splits the string into "udhv zcvi nhtnfyd " and "erwuyawa pun". Then it checks if the last word of the first part ("nhtnfyd") is the same as the first word of the second part ("erwuyawa"). They are not the same, so it returns the original string.

Therefore, the output of executing the function `f` on the input "udhv zcvi nhtnfyd :erwuyawa pun" is "udhv zcvi nhtnfyd :erwuyawa pun".

<<<Output>>>
'udhv zcvi nhtnfyd :erwuyawa pun'
