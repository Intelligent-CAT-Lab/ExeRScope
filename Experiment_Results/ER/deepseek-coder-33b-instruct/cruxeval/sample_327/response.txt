The function f takes a list lst as input. It creates a new empty list new. It then initializes a variable i to the last index of lst. It then enters a loop that runs for the length of lst. In each iteration of the loop, it checks if i is even. If it is, it appends the negative of the i-th element of lst to new. If i is odd, it appends the i-th element of lst to new. After each iteration, it decrements i by 1. Finally, it returns new.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 7, -1, -3], we need to follow the steps of the function.

1. Initialize new to an empty list and i to 3 (the last index of [1, 7, -1, -3]).
2. Enter the loop that runs 4 times.
3. In the first iteration, i is 3, which is odd. Append -3 (the 3rd element of [1, 7, -1, -3]) to new.
4. Decrement i to 2.
5. In the second iteration, i is 2, which is even. Append 7 (the 2nd element of [1, 7, -1, -3]) to new.
6. Decrement i to 1.
7. In the third iteration, i is 1, which is odd. Append -1 (the 1st element of [1, 7, -1, -3]) to new.
8. Decrement i to 0.
9. In the fourth iteration, i is 0, which is even. Append 1 (the 0th element of [1, 7, -1, -3]) to new.
10. Decrement i to -1.
11. Exit the loop.
12. Return new.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 7, -1, -3] is [-3, 7, 1, -1].

<<<Output>>>
[-3, 7, 1, -1]
