The function f takes a string text as input. It initializes two variables m and cnt to 0. Then it splits the input text into words using the split() function. For each word, it checks if the length of the word is greater than the current maximum length m. If it is, it increments the count cnt and updates m to the length of the current word. Finally, it returns the count cnt.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "wys silak v5 e4fi rotbi fwj 78 wigf t8s lcl", we need to follow the steps of the function.

1. Split the input text into words: ["wys", "silak", "v5", "e4fi", "rotbi", "fwj", "78", "wigf", "t8s", "lcl"]
2. For each word, check if its length is greater than the current maximum length m. If it is, increment the count cnt and update m to the length of the current word.
3. The maximum lengths for each word are: 3, 5, 2, 4, 5, 3, 2, 4, 2, 2. So, the count cnt is 1 for "wys", 2 for "silak", 2 for "v5", 3 for "e4fi", 4 for "rotbi", 3 for "fwj", 2 for "78", 3 for "wigf", 2 for "t8s", 2 for "lcl".
4. Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "wys silak v5 e4fi rotbi fwj 78 wigf t8s lcl" is 10.
