The function f takes an array and an element as input. It checks if the element is in the array. If it is, it returns the index of the element in the array. If it's not, it returns -1.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [6, 2, 7, 1] and 6, we need to check if 6 is in the array [6, 2, 7, 1]. It is, so the output of executing the function f on the input [6, 2, 7, 1] and 6 is the index of 6 in the array, which is 0.
