The function f takes a list xs as input. It then iterates over the list in reverse order, starting from the last element and going to the first. For each element, it extends the list by adding the current element twice.

For the input [4, 8, 8, 5], the function will first add 5 twice, then 8 twice, then 8 twice, and finally 4 twice. The resulting list will be [4, 4, 8, 8, 8, 8, 5, 5].

<<<Output>>>
[4, 4, 8, 8, 8, 8, 5, 5]
