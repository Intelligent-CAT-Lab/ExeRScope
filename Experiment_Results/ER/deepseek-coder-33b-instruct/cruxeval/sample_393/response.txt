The function f takes a string text as input. It first reverses the string using slicing (text[::-1]). Then it initializes an empty string text2. It then iterates over the reversed string in steps of 3, starting from the 4th character from the end and going backwards. For each group of 3 characters, it joins them with '---' and adds the result to text2. Finally, it returns text2 without the last '---'.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'scala', we need to follow the steps outlined above.

First, the string 'scala' is reversed to 'alacs'. Then, the loop starts from the 4th character from the end ('s') and goes backwards, in steps of 3. The groups of 3 characters are 's', 'a', 'l', 'a', 'c', 's'. For each group, they are joined with '---' and added to text2. The result is 's---a---l---a---c---s---'. Finally, the last '---' is removed from text2 to get the final output.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'scala' is 's---a---l---a---c---s'.

<<<Output>>>
's---a---l---a---c---s'
