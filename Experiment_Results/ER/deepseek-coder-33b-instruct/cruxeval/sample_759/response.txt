The function f takes two strings as input: text and sub. It initializes an empty list index. It then enters a while loop where it repeatedly searches for the substring sub in the text starting from the position starting. If the substring is found, its starting position is appended to the list index and the starting position is moved to the position after the found substring. If the substring is not found, the loop is exited. Finally, the list index is returned.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'egmdartoa' and 'good', we need to find all occurrences of 'good' in 'egmdartoa'. The string 'good' starts at position 3 and 5 in 'egmdartoa', so the output of executing the function f on the input 'egmdartoa' and 'good' is [3, 5].

<<<Output>>>
[3, 5]
