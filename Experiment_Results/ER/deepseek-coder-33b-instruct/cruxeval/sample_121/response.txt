The function f takes a string s as input. It first filters out all the non-numeric characters from the string and joins them together to form a new string nums. If nums is an empty string, it returns 'none'. Otherwise, it splits nums into a list of strings, converts each string to an integer, and finds the maximum integer. It then converts the maximum integer back to a string and returns it.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input '01,001', we need to follow the steps of the function.

1. Filter out all the non-numeric characters from the string '01,001'. The result is '01001'.
2. Split the string '01001' into a list of strings ['01', '001'].
3. Convert each string in the list to an integer. The result is [1, 1].
4. Find the maximum integer in the list [1, 1]. The result is 1.
5. Convert the maximum integer 1 back to a string. The result is '1'.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input '01,001' is '1'.

<<<Output>>>
'1'
