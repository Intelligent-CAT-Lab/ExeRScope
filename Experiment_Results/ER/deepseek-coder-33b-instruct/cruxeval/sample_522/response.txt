The function f takes a list of numbers as input. It creates a new list floats where each element is the fractional part of the corresponding element in the input list. Then it checks if the number 1 is in the list floats. If it is, it returns the list floats. Otherwise, it returns an empty list.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input range(100, 120), we need to calculate the fractional part of each number in the range. The fractional part of a number is the part after the decimal point. For example, the fractional part of 100.5 is 0.5.

In the range from 100 to 120, there are no numbers with a fractional part of 1. Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input range(100, 120) is an empty list [].
