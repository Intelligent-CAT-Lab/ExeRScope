The function f takes a dictionary d and a list l as input. It creates a new dictionary new_d and iterates over each key in the list l. If the key is present in the dictionary d, it adds the key-value pair to new_d. Finally, it returns a copy of new_d.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input {"lorem ipsum" : 12, "dolor" : 23}, ["lorem ipsum", "dolor"], we need to create a new dictionary with the key-value pairs from the input dictionary that have keys present in the input list.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input {"lorem ipsum" : 12, "dolor" : 23}, ["lorem ipsum", "dolor"] is {"lorem ipsum" : 12, "dolor" : 23}.

<<<Output>>>
{'lorem ipsum': 12, 'dolor': 23}
