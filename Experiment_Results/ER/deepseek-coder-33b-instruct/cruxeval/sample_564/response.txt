The function f takes a list of lists as input. It first clears the second list in the list of lists, then appends the second list to the third list. Finally, it returns the first list in the list of lists.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [[395, 666, 7, 4], [], [4223, 111]], we need to follow the steps in the function:
1. Clear the second list, which is an empty list.
2. Append the second list (which is now empty) to the third list, which results in [[4223, 111]].
3. Return the first list, which is [395, 666, 7, 4].

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [[395, 666, 7, 4], [], [4223, 111]] is [395, 666, 7, 4].

<<<Output>>>
[395, 666, 7, 4]
