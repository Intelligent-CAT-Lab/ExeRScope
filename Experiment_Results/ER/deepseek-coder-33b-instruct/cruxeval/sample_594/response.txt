The function f takes a string file as input and returns the index of the first occurrence of the newline character '\n' in the string.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "n wez szize lnson tilebi it 504n.\n", we need to find the index of the first occurrence of '\n' in the string.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "n wez szize lnson tilebi it 504n.\n" is 24.
<<<Output>>>
