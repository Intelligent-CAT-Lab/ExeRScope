The function f takes a string text as input. It then iterates over each character in the text. If the character is not a whitespace, it immediately returns False. If the function iterates over all characters without finding a non-whitespace character, it returns True.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input '     i', we need to check each character in the string. The first character is a whitespace, so the function continues to the next character. The second character is also a whitespace, and so on. The last character is 'i', which is not a whitespace, so the function returns False.
