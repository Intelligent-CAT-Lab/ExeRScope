The function f takes a string as input. It enters a while loop that continues until the string is empty. In each iteration of the loop, it checks if the last character of the string is an alphabetical character. If it is, it returns the string. If it is not, it removes the last character from the string and continues with the next iteration. If the string becomes empty, it returns the empty string.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input '--4/0-209', we need to follow the steps of the function.

1. The last character of the string is '/', which is not an alphabetical character. So, it removes the last character from the string. The string becomes '--4/0-20'.
2. The last character of the string is '0', which is an alphabetical character. So, it returns the string.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input '--4/0-209' is '--4/0-20'.

<<<Output>>>
'--4/0-20'
