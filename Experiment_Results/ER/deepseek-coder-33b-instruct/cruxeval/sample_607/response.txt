The function f takes a string text as input. It then iterates over a list of punctuation marks ['.', '!', '?']. For each punctuation mark, it checks if the input text ends with that punctuation mark. If it does, it returns True. If it doesn't find any punctuation mark at the end of the text, it returns False.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input '. C.', it checks if the text ends with '.', '!', or '?'. In this case, it checks if '. C.' ends with '.', '!', or '?'. It does not end with '.', but it does end with '?'. Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input '. C.' is True.
