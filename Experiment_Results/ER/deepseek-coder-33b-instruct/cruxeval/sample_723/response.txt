The function f takes a string text and a boolean value separator as input. It splits the text into lines using the splitlines() method. If the separator is True, it joins each line with a space and returns a list of these joined lines. If the separator is False, it simply returns the list of lines.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'dga nqdk\rull qcha kl' and 1, we need to split the text into lines and join each line with a space. The text 'dga nqdk\rull qcha kl' is split into ['dga nqdk', 'ull qcha kl'] and then joined with a space to get ['dga nqdk ull qcha kl'].

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'dga nqdk\rull qcha kl' and 1 is ['dga nqdk ull qcha kl'].

<<<Output>>>
['dga nqdk ull qcha kl']
