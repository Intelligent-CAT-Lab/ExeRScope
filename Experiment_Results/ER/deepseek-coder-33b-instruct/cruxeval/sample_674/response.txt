The function f takes a string text as input. It converts the string into a list of characters. Then it iterates over the list in reverse order. For each character, it checks if the character is not in the string 'zyxwvutsrqponmlkjihgfedcba'. If the character is not in the string, it removes the character from the list. The function finally returns the joined list as a string.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'qq', we need to follow the steps of the function.

1. Convert 'qq' into a list of characters: ['q', 'q']
2. Iterate over the list in reverse order:
   - For the first iteration, 'q' is not in 'zyxwvutsrqponmlkjihgfedcba', so it is not removed from the list.
   - For the second iteration, 'q' is not in 'zyxwvutsrqponmlkjihgfedcba', so it is not removed from the list.
3. Join the list back into a string: 'qq'

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'qq' is 'qq'.

<<<Output>>>
'qq'
