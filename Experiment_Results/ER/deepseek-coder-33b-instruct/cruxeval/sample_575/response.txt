The function f takes a list of numbers nums and a value val as input. It creates a new list new_list and for each number i in nums, it extends new_list by adding i val times. Finally, it returns the sum of all elements in new_list.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [10, 4] and 3, we need to follow the steps:
1. For the first number 10 in nums, extend new_list by adding 10 three times. So new_list becomes [10, 10, 10].
2. For the second number 4 in nums, extend new_list by adding 4 three times. So new_list becomes [10, 10, 10, 4, 4, 4].
3. Finally, return the sum of all elements in new_list.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [10, 4] and 3 is 52.
