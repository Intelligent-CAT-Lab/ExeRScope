The function f takes a string n as input. It first calculates the length of the string n and adds 2 to it. Then it converts the string n into a list revn. It joins the elements of the list revn into a string result. It then clears the list revn. Finally, it returns the string result concatenated with '!' repeated length times.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'iq', we need to follow the steps of the function.

1. The length of 'iq' is 2. Adding 2 to it gives 4.
2. The string 'iq' is converted into a list ['i', 'q'].
3. The elements of the list ['i', 'q'] are joined into a string 'iq'.
4. The list ['i', 'q'] is cleared.
5. The string 'iq' is concatenated with '!' repeated 4 times.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'iq' is 'iq!!!'.

<<<Output>>>
'iq!!!'
