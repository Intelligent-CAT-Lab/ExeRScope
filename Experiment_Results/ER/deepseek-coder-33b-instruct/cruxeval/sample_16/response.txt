The function f takes two strings as input: text and suffix. It checks if the text ends with the suffix. If it does, it returns the text without the suffix. If it doesn't, it returns the original text.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'zejrohaj' and 'owc', we need to check if 'zejrohaj' ends with 'owc'. It does not, so the output is the original text, 'zejrohaj'.

<<<Output>>>
'zejrohaj'
