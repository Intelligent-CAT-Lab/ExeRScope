The function f takes a list of numbers nums, an integer spot, and an integer idx as input. It inserts the integer idx at the spot-th position in the list nums and then returns the modified list.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 0, 1, 1], 0, 9, we need to insert 9 at the 0-th position in the list [1, 0, 1, 1]. Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 0, 1, 1], 0, 9 is [9, 1, 0, 1, 1].

<<<Output>>>
[9, 1, 0, 1, 1]
