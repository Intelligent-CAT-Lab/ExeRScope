The function f takes a dictionary playlist, a string liker_name, and a string song_index as input. It updates the dictionary playlist by adding the song_index to the list of songs liked by the liker_name. If the liker_name is not already a key in the dictionary, it adds the liker_name to the dictionary with an empty list as the value. The function then returns the updated dictionary.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input `f({'aki': ['1', '5']}, 'aki', '2')`, we need to follow the steps of the function:
1. The liker_name 'aki' is already a key in the dictionary playlist. So, playlist[liker_name] = playlist.get(liker_name, []) assigns the value ['1', '5'] to playlist[liker_name].
2. Then, playlist[liker_name].append(song_index) appends the song_index '2' to the list of songs liked by 'aki'.
3. Finally, the function returns the updated dictionary playlist.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input `f({'aki': ['1', '5']}, 'aki', '2')` is `{'aki': ['1', '5', '2']}`.

<<<Output>>>
{'aki': ['1', '5', '2']}
