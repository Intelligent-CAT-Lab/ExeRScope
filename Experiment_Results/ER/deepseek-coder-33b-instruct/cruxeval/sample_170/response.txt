The function f takes a list of numbers nums and a number as input. It uses the count method of the list to count the number of occurrences of the given number in the list.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input ```([12, 0, 13, 4, 12], 12)```, we need to count the number of occurrences of 12 in the list [12, 0, 13, 4, 12].

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input ```([12, 0, 13, 4, 12], 12)``` is 2.
