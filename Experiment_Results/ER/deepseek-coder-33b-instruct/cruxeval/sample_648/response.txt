The function f takes two lists as input. It first makes a copy of the first list. Then it enters a while loop, which continues until the copy of the first list is empty. Inside the loop, it checks if the last element of the copy of the first list is in the second list. If it is, it removes the last element from the copy of the first list. If it is not, it returns the last element of the copy of the first list. If the while loop completes without finding a non-matching element, it returns the string 'missing'.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input ```([0, 4, 5, 6], [13, 23, -5, 0])```, we need to follow the steps of the function.

First, it makes a copy of the first list, which is ```[0, 4, 5, 6]```. Then it enters the while loop. The last element of the copy of the first list is 6, which is not in the second list ```[13, 23, -5, 0]```. So, it does not remove the last element from the copy of the first list. Then it checks the next element, which is 5, which is not in the second list. It does not remove the last element from the copy of the first list. Then it checks the next element, which is 4, which is not in the second list. It does not remove the last element from the copy of the first list. Then it checks the next element, which is 0, which is in the second list. It removes the last element from the copy of the first list. The copy of the first list is now ```[0, 4, 5]```. Then it checks the next element, which is 5, which is not in the second list. It does not remove the last element from the copy of the first list. Then it checks the next element, which is 4, which is not in the second list. It does not remove the last element from the copy of the first list. Then it checks the next element, which is 0, which is in the second list. It removes the last element from the copy of the first list. The copy of the first list is now ```[0, 4]```. Then it checks the next element, which is 4, which is not in the second list. It does not remove the last element from the copy of the first list. Then it checks the next element, which is 0, which is in the second list. It removes the last element from the copy of the first list. The copy of the first list is now ```[0]```. Then it checks the next element, which is 0, which is in the second list. It removes the last element from the copy of the first list. The copy of the first list is now empty. Since the copy of the first list is empty, it returns the string 'missing'.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input ```([0, 4, 5, 6], [13, 23, -5, 0])``` is 'missing'.

<<<Output>>>
'missing'
