The function f takes a number num as input. It checks if the number is greater than 0 and less than 1000 and not equal to 6174. If the number satisfies these conditions, it returns the string 'Half Life'. Otherwise, it returns the string 'Not found'.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 6173, we need to check if the number 6173 satisfies the conditions. It is greater than 0 and less than 1000, but it is equal to 6174. Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 6173 is 'Not found'.

<<<Output>>>
'Not found'
