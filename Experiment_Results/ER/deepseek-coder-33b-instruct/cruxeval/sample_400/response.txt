The function f takes a string multi_string as input. It splits the multi_string into a list of words using the split() method. Then it checks each word in the list to see if it is ASCII using the isascii() method. If any word is ASCII, it joins the ASCII words into a string with ', ' as the separator and returns it. If no word is ASCII, it returns an empty string.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'I am hungry! eat food.', we need to split the input into words: ['I', 'am', 'hungry!', 'eat', 'food.']. Then we check each word to see if it is ASCII. 'I', 'am', 'eat', and 'food.' are ASCII, but 'hungry!' is not. Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'I am hungry! eat food.' is 'I, am, eat, food'.

<<<Output>>>
'I, am, eat, food'
