The function f takes a dictionary d as input. It initializes an empty list keys. Then it iterates over each key-value pair in the dictionary. For each key-value pair, it formats a string that contains the key, an arrow, and the value, and appends this string to the list keys. Finally, it returns the list keys.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input ```{'-4':'4','1':'2','-':'-3'}```, we need to follow the steps in the function.

1. Initialize an empty list keys.
2. Iterate over each key-value pair in the dictionary.
3. For each key-value pair, format a string that contains the key, an arrow, and the value, and append this string to the list keys.
4. Return the list keys.

So, the output of executing the function f on the input ```{'-4':'4','1':'2','-':'-3'}``` is ```['-4 => 4', '1 => 2', '- => -3']```.

<<<Output>>>
['-4 => 4', '1 => 2', '- => -3']
