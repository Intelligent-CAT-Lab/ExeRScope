The function f takes a string text as input. It initializes a variable ws to 0. Then it iterates over each character in the text. If the character is a whitespace, it increments ws by 1. Finally, it returns a tuple containing ws and the length of the text.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "jcle oq wsnibktxpiozyxmopqkfnrfjds", we need to count the number of whitespace characters in the string and also find the length of the string.

In the string "jcle oq wsnibktxpiozyxmopqkfnrfjds", there are 5 whitespace characters. The length of the string is 30.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "jcle oq wsnibktxpiozyxmopqkfnrfjds" is (5, 30).

<<<Output>>>
(5, 30)
