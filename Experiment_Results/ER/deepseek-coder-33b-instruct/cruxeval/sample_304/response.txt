The function f takes a dictionary d as input. It first sorts the dictionary items by keys in descending order and pops the first item (which has the highest key) from the dictionary. It then repeats the same process for the second highest key. The function returns a new dictionary with the two popped items.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input {2: 3, 17: 3, 16: 6, 18: 6, 87: 7}, we need to follow the steps of the function:

1. Sort the dictionary items by keys in descending order. The sorted items are [(87, 7), (18, 6), (16, 6), (17, 3), (2, 3)].
2. Pop the first item (87, 7) from the dictionary. The dictionary becomes {18: 6, 16: 6, 17: 3, 2: 3}.
3. Sort the dictionary items by keys in descending order. The sorted items are [(18, 6), (16, 6), (17, 3), (2, 3)].
4. Pop the first item (18, 6) from the dictionary. The dictionary becomes {16: 6, 17: 3, 2: 3}.
5. Return a new dictionary with the popped items {87: 7, 18: 6}.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input {2: 3, 17: 3, 16: 6, 18: 6, 87: 7} is {87: 7, 18: 6}.

<<<Output>>>
{87: 7, 18: 6}
