The function f takes a string text as input. It counts the number of hyphens in the text and compares it to the length of the text. If the count of hyphens is equal to the length of the text, it returns True, otherwise it returns False.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "---123-4", we need to count the number of hyphens in the text and compare it to the length of the text.

In the string "---123-4", there are 7 hyphens and the length of the text is also 7. Therefore, the count of hyphens is equal to the length of the text.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "---123-4" is False.

<<<Output>>>
False
