The function f takes a dictionary d and a key k as input. It creates a new dictionary new_d and iterates over the items in the input dictionary. For each item, it checks if the key is less than k. If it is, it adds the key-value pair to the new dictionary. Finally, it returns the new dictionary.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input {1: 2, 2: 4, 3: 3} and 3, we need to iterate over the items in the input dictionary. For each item, we check if the key is less than 3. If it is, we add the key-value pair to the new dictionary. Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input {1: 2, 2: 4, 3: 3} and 3 is {1: 2, 2: 4}.

<<<Output>>>
{1: 2, 2: 4}
