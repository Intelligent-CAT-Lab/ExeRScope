The function f takes an array and an element as input. It first counts the number of occurrences of the element in the array and then adds the element to this count.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 1, 1] and -2, we need to count the number of occurrences of -2 in the array [1, 1, 1] and then add -2 to this count.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 1, 1] and -2 is 0.
