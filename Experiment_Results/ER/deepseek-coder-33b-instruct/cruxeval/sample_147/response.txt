The function f takes a list of numbers as input. It first calculates the middle index of the list by dividing the length of the list by 2 and taking the integer part of the result. Then it returns a new list that consists of the elements from the middle index to the end of the list, followed by the elements from the start of the list to the middle index.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 1, 1], we need to follow the steps in the function:
1. The middle index is calculated as len([1, 1, 1])//2 = 1 (integer division).
2. The elements from the middle index to the end of the list are [1] (nums[middle:]).
3. The elements from the start of the list to the middle index are [1, 1] (nums[0:middle]).
4. The two lists are concatenated to form the final result, which is [1] + [1, 1] = [1, 1, 1].

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 1, 1] is [1, 1, 1].

<<<Output>>>
[1, 1, 1]
