The function f takes a string sentences as input. It splits the sentences into a list of sentences by the '.' character. Then it checks if all the sentences are decimal numbers. If they are, it returns 'oscillating'. If not, it returns 'not oscillating'.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'not numbers', it splits the input into ['not numbers']. Then it checks if all the sentences are decimal numbers. 'not numbers' is not a decimal number, so the output of executing the function f on the input 'not numbers' is 'not oscillating'.

<<<Output>>>
'not oscillating'
