The function f takes two arguments: a string text and a string use. It replaces all occurrences of the string use in the string text with an empty string ('').
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'Chris requires a ride to the airport on Friday.' and 'a', we need to replace all occurrences of 'a' in 'Chris requires a ride to the airport on Friday.' with an empty string.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'Chris requires a ride to the airport on Friday.' and 'a' is 'Chris requires  ride to the irport on Friday.'.
<<<Output>>>
'Chris requires  ride to the irport on Friday.'
