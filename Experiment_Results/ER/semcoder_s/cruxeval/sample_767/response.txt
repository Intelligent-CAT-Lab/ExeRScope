Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code

def f(s):
    return s + "a"

[Question]
What would be the return value of ```f("hi")```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[Answer]

The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

</Example>
Consider the following code
def f(text):
    a = text.strip().split(' ')
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if a[i].isdigit() is False:
            return '-'
    return " ".join(a)
[Question]
What would be the return value of ```f("d khqw whi fwi bbn 41")```?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

[Answer]
The function f takes a string text as input and processes it. It first strips the string of leading and trailing whitespaces and then splits the string into a list of words based on spaces. It then iterates over the list of words and checks if each word is a digit. If any word is not a digit, it returns '-'. If all words are digits, it returns the original string.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "d khqw whi fwi bbn 41", we need to split the string into words and check if all words are digits. Since "41" is a digit, the function will return the original string "d khqw whi fwi bbn 41".
<<<Output>>>
'd khqw whi fwi bbn 41'
