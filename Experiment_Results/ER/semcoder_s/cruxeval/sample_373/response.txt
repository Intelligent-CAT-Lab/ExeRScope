<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><Instruction> I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code

def f(s):
    return s + "a"

[Question]
What would be the return value of ```f("hi")```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[Answer]

The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

</Example>
Consider the following code
def f(orig):
    copy = orig
    copy.append(100)
    orig.pop()
    return copy
[Question]
What would be the return value of ```f([1, 2, 3])```?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

[Answer]
The function f takes a list orig as input and performs operations on it.

- The variable copy is assigned the reference to the list orig.
- The list copy is then modified by appending the number 100.
- The last element of the list orig is removed.
- Finally, the function returns the modified list copy.

When the function f is called with the list [1, 2, 3], the list [1, 2, 3] is copied to copy and then modified. After the modification, the list copy becomes [1, 2, 3, 100] and the function returns this list.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 2, 3] is [1, 2, 3, 100].
<<<Output>>>
[1, 2, 3, 100]
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
