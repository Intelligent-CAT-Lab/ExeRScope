<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><Instruction> I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code

def f(s):
    return s + "a"

[Question]
What would be the return value of ```f("hi")```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[Answer]

The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

</Example>
Consider the following code
def f(array, elem):
    ind = array.index(elem)
    return ind * 2 + array[-ind - 1] * 3
[Question]
What would be the return value of ```f([-1, 2, 1, -8, 2], 2)```?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

[Answer]
The function f takes an array and an element as input. It finds the index of the element in the array, and then returns the result of the expression ind * 2 + array[-ind - 1] * 3, where ind is the index of the element.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input ([ -1, 2, 1, -8, 2], 2), we need to find the index of 2 in the array, which is 1. Then, we calculate the expression 1 * 2 + array[-1 - 1] * 3, where array[-1 - 1] refers to the last element of the array, which is 2.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input ([ -1, 2, 1, -8, 2], 2) is 2 * 2 + 2 * 3 = 4 + 6 = 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
