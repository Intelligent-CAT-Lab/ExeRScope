<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><Instruction> I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.
</Instruction>
Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code

def f(s):
    return s + "a"

[Question]
What would be the return value of ```f("hi")```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[Answer]

The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

</Example>
Consider the following code
def f(string):
    while string:
        if string[-1].isalpha():
            return string
        string = string[:-1]
    return string
[Question]
What would be the return value of ```f('--4/0-209')```?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

[Answer]
The function f takes a string as input and returns the string without its trailing alphanumeric characters.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input '--4/0-209', we need to remove the trailing alphanumeric characters from the string.

The trailing alphanumeric characters in '--4/0-209' are '9', '0', '/', '0', '4', and '-'. So, the output of executing the function f on the input '--4/0-209' is '--4/0-20'.

<<<Output>>>
'--4/0-20'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
