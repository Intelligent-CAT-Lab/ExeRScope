<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><Instruction> I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code

def f(s):
    return s + "a"

[Question]
What would be the return value of ```f("hi")```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[Answer]

The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

</Example>
Consider the following code
def f(text, value):
    indexes = list()
    for i in range(len(text)):
        if text[i] == value:
            indexes.append(i)
    new_text = list(text)
    for i in indexes:
        new_text.remove(value)
    return ''.join(new_text)
[Question]
What would be the return value of ```f('scedvtvotkwqfoqn', 'o')```?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}

[Answer]
The function f takes a string text and a character value as input. It first identifies the indexes of the character value in the string text. Then, it creates a new list from the string text and removes all occurrences of the character value from the list. Finally, it joins the list back into a string and returns the result.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'scedvtvotkwqfoqn' and 'o', we need to identify the indexes of 'o' in the string 'scedvtvotkwqfoqn', remove all 'o' from the string, and then join the remaining characters back into a string.

The character 'o' appears at indexes 12, 15, and 16 in the string 'scedvtvotkwqfoqn'. After removing all 'o' from the string, the resulting string is 'scedvtvotkwqfnqn'.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the inputs 'scedvtvotkwqfoqn' and 'o' is 'scedvtvotkwqfnqn'.

<<<Output>>>
'scedvtvotkwqfnqn'
