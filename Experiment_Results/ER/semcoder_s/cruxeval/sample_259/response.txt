<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><Instruction> I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code

def f(s):
    return s + "a"

[Question]
What would be the return value of ```f("hi")```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[Answer]

The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

</Example>
Consider the following code
def f(text):
    new_text = []
    for character in text:
        if character.isupper():
            new_text.insert(len(new_text) // 2, character)
    if len(new_text) == 0:
        new_text = ['-']
    return ''.join(new_text)
[Question]
What would be the return value of ```f('String matching is a big part of RexEx library.')```?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

[Answer]
The function f takes a string text as input and processes it character by character. It checks if the character is uppercase and if it is, it inserts it into the new_text list at the middle index. If the new_text list is empty after processing all characters, it is filled with a '-'. Finally, it joins all characters in the new_text list to form a string and returns it.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'String matching is a big part of RexEx library.', we need to process each character in the string. The uppercase characters 'S', 'R', 'I', 'B', 'P', 'R', 'L', 'Y' will be inserted at the middle index of the new_text list. After processing all characters, the new_text list will contain these characters in the order they were inserted.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'String matching is a big part of RexEx library.' is 'SRIBPRL'.
<<<Output>>>
'SRIBPRL'
