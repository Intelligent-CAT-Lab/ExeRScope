<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><Instruction> I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code

def f(s):
    return s + "a"

[Question]
What would be the return value of ```f("hi")```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[Answer]

The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code
def f(char_map, text):
    new_text = ''
    for ch in text:
        val = char_map.get(ch)
        if val is None:
            new_text += ch
        else:
            new_text += val
    return new_text
[Question]
What would be the return value of ```f({}, 'hbd')```?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}

[Answer]
The function f takes a dictionary char_map and a string text as input. It iterates over each character in the text and checks if it exists as a key in the char_map dictionary. If it does not exist, it appends the character to the new_text string. If it exists, it appends the corresponding value to the new_text string.

In this case, the function is called with an empty dictionary and the string 'hbd'. Since none of the characters in 'hbd' exist as keys in the empty dictionary, the new_text string will remain the same as the input text, resulting in 'hbd'.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the inputs ```f({}, 'hbd')``` is 'hbd'.
<<<Output>>>
'hbd'
