<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><Instruction> I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.
</Instruction>
Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code

def f(s):
    return s + "a"

[Question]
What would be the return value of ```f("hi")```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[Answer]

The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

</Example>
Consider the following code
def f(array, n):
    return array[n:]
[Question]
What would be the return value of ```f([0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2], 4)```?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

[Answer]
The function f takes an array and an integer n as input and returns a slice of the array starting from the nth index to the end of the array.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input ([0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2], 4), we need to slice the array from the 4th index to the end, which results in [2, 2, 2].
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input ([0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2], 4) is [2, 2, 2].
<<<Output>>>
[2, 2, 2]
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
