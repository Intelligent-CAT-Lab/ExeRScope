<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><Instruction> I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.
</Instruction>
Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code

def f(s):
    return s + "a"

[Question]
What would be the return value of ```f("hi")```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[Answer]

The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

</Example>
Consider the following code
def f(array):
    just_ns = list(map(lambda num: 'n'*num, array))
    final_output = []
    for wipe in just_ns:
        final_output.append(wipe)
    return final_output
[Question]
What would be the return value of ```f([])```?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

[Answer]
The function f takes an array as input and returns a list of strings. The function first creates a new list just_ns by mapping each element of the input array to a string of 'n' repeated that number of times. Then, it iterates over just_ns and appends each string to the final_output list. Finally, it returns the final_output list.

Since the input is an empty array, the just_ns list will also be empty. Therefore, the final_output list will also be empty.
<<<Output>>>
[]
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
