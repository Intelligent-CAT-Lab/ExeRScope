<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><Instruction> I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.
</Instruction>
Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code

def f(s):
    return s + "a"

[Question]
What would be the return value of ```f("hi")```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[Answer]

The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

</Example>
Consider the following code
def f(d, l):
	new_d = {}

	for k in l:
		if d.get(k) is not None:
			new_d[k] = d[k]

	return new_d.copy()
[Question]
What would be the return value of ```f({"lorem ipsum" : 12, "dolor" : 23}, ["lorem ipsum", "dolor"])```?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}

[Answer]
The function f takes a dictionary d and a list l as input. It creates a new dictionary new_d and populates it with key-value pairs from d where the key is present in l. Finally, it returns a copy of new_d.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input `{"lorem ipsum" : 12, "dolor" : 23}` and `["lorem ipsum", "dolor"]`, we need to create a new dictionary with key-value pairs from the input dictionary where the key is present in the list.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input `{"lorem ipsum" : 12, "dolor" : 23}` and `["lorem ipsum", "dolor"]` is `{"lorem ipsum" : 12, "dolor" : 23}`.
<<<Output>>>
{'lorem ipsum': 12, 'dolor': 23}
