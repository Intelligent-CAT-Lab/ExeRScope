<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><Instruction> I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code

def f(s):
    return s + "a"

[Question]
What would be the return value of ```f("hi")```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[Answer]

The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

</Example>
Consider the following code
def f(text, strip_chars):
    return text[::-1].strip(strip_chars)[::-1]
[Question]
What would be the return value of ```f('tcmfsmj', 'cfj')```?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

[Answer]
The function f takes two arguments: text and strip_chars. It first reverses the text, then removes any characters present in strip_chars from the start and end of the reversed text, and finally reverses the result again.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input ('tcmfsmj', 'cfj'), we need to reverse 'tcmfsmj' to 'jmsfmc', remove any characters present in 'cfj' from the start and end of 'jmsfmc', and then reverse the result again.

After reversing, the string becomes 'jmcsfm', after stripping 'cfj' from the start and end, we get 'm', and finally reversing 'm' gives 'm'.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input ('tcmfsmj', 'cfj') is 'm'.

<<<Output>>>
'm'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
