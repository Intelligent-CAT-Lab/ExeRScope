<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><Instruction> I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.
</Instruction>
Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code

def f(s):
    return s + "a"

[Question]
What would be the return value of ```f("hi")```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[Answer]

The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

</Example>
Consider the following code
def f(text):
    ls = list(text)
    for i in range(0, len(ls)):
        if ls[i]!='+':
            ls.insert(i, '+')
            ls.insert(i, '*')
            break
    return '+'.join(ls)
[Question]
What would be the return value of ```f('nzoh')```?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

[Answer]
The function f takes a string text as input and processes it by converting it into a list of characters. It then iterates over the list and inserts '*' and '+' at the index i if the character at index i is not '+'. The function then joins the list with '+' and returns the resulting string.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'nzoh', we need to iterate over the characters in the string 'nzoh' and insert '*' and '+' before the first character that is not '+'.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'nzoh' is '*+n*z*o*h'.
<<<Output>>>
'*+n*z*o*h'
