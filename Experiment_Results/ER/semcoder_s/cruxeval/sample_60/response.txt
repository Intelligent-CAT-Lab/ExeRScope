<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><Instruction> I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.
</Instruction>
Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code

def f(s):
    return s + "a"

[Question]
What would be the return value of ```f("hi")```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[Answer]

The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

</Example>
Consider the following code
def f(doc):
    for x in doc:
        if x.isalpha():
            return x.capitalize()
    return '-'
[Question]
What would be the return value of ```f('raruwa')```?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

[Answer]
The function f takes a string doc as input and iterates over each character x in the string. If x is an alphabet character, it returns the capitalized version of x. If no alphabet character is found, it returns '-'.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'raruwa', we need to find the first alphabet character in the string 'raruwa' and return its capitalized version.

The first alphabet character in 'raruwa' is 'r'. After capitalizing it, the output will be 'R'.
<<<Output>>>
'R'
