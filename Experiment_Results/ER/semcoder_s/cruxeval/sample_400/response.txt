<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><Instruction> I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.
</Instruction>
Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code

def f(s):
    return s + "a"

[Question]
What would be the return value of ```f("hi")```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[Answer]

The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

</Example>
Consider the following code
def f(multi_string):
    cond_string = map(str.isascii, multi_string.split())
    if True in cond_string:
        return ', '.join(x for x in multi_string.split() if x.isascii())
    return ''
[Question]
What would be the return value of ```f('I am hungry! eat food.')```?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}

[Answer]
The function f takes a string multi_string as input and checks if each word in the string is an ASCII character. If there is at least one ASCII character, it returns a string consisting of those words separated by a comma and a space. Otherwise, it returns an empty string.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'I am hungry! eat food.', we need to split the string into words, check if each word is an ASCII character, and then join the ASCII characters back together into a string separated by a comma and a space.

The words 'I', 'am', 'hungry!', 'eat', and 'food.' are all ASCII characters, so the output of executing the function f on the input 'I am hungry! eat food.' is 'I, am, hungry!, eat, food.'.

<<<Output>>>
'I, am, hungry!, eat, food.'
