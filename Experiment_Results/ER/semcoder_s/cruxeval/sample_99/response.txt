<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><Instruction> I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code

def f(s):
    return s + "a"

[Question]
What would be the return value of ```f("hi")```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[Answer]

The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

</Example>
Consider the following code
def f(text, sep, num):
    return '___'.join(text.rsplit(sep, num))
[Question]
What would be the return value of ```f('aa+++bb', '+', 1)```?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

[Answer]
The function f takes three arguments: text, sep, and num. It splits the text using sep as the separator and then splits it num+1 times. It then joins the split parts using '___' as the separator.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input ('aa+++bb', '+', 1), we need to split 'aa+++bb' using '+' as the separator once, resulting in ['aa', 'bb']. Then we join the split parts using '___' as the separator, resulting in 'aa___bb'.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input ('aa+++bb', '+', 1) is 'aa___bb'.
<<<Output>>>
'aa___bb'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
