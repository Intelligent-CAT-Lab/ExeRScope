<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><Instruction> I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code

def f(s):
    return s + "a"

[Question]
What would be the return value of ```f("hi")```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[Answer]

The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

</Example>
Consider the following code
def f(text, chars):
    if chars:
        text = text.rstrip(chars)
    else:
        text = text.rstrip(' ')
    if text == '':
        return '-'
    return text
[Question]
What would be the return value of ```f('new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.2', '0123456789-')```?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

[Answer]
The function f takes two arguments: text and chars. It first checks if chars is not empty. If it's not empty, it trims the trailing characters specified in chars from the text. If chars is empty, it trims trailing spaces from the text. Then it checks if the resulting text is empty. If it is, it returns '-'. Otherwise, it returns the resulting text.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.2' and '0123456789-', we first trim the trailing characters specified in '0123456789-' from the text 'new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.2'. This results in 'new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.'. Then we check if the resulting text is empty. It is not, so we return 'new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.'.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.2' and '0123456789-' is 'new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.'.

<<<Output>>>
'new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.'
