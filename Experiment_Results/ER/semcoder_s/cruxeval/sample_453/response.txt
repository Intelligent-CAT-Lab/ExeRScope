<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><Instruction> I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.
</Instruction>
Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code

def f(s):
    return s + "a"

[Question]
What would be the return value of ```f("hi")```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[Answer]

The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

</Example>
Consider the following code
def f(string, c):
    return string.endswith(c)
[Question]
What would be the return value of ```f('wrsch)xjmb8', 'c')```?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

[Answer]
The function f takes two arguments: a string and a character. It checks if the last character of the string matches the provided character and returns True if they match, False otherwise.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input ('wrsch)xjmb8', 'c'), we need to check if the last character of the string 'wrsch)xjmb8' is 'c'.

The last character of the string 'wrsch)xjmb8' is '8', which does not match the character 'c'.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input ('wrsch)xjmb8', 'c') is False.
<<<Output>>>
False
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
