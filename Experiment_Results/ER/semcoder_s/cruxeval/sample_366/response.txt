<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><Instruction> I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.
</Instruction>
Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code

def f(s):
    return s + "a"

[Question]
What would be the return value of ```f("hi")```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[Answer]

The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

</Example>
Consider the following code
def f(string):
    tmp = string.lower()
    for char in string.lower():
        if char in tmp:
            tmp = tmp.replace(char, '', 1)
    return tmp
[Question]
What would be the return value of ```f('[ Hello ]+ Hello, World!!_ Hi')```?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

[Answer]
The function f takes a string as input and returns a string with all characters that are not alphabets removed.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input '[ Hello ]+ Hello, World!!_ Hi', we need to remove all characters that are not alphabets.

After removing non-alphabetic characters, the string becomes 'HelloHelloWorldHi'.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input '[ Hello ]+ Hello, World!!_ Hi' is 'HelloHelloWorldHi'.

<<<Output>>>
'HelloHelloWorldHi'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
