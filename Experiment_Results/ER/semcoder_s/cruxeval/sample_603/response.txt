<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><Instruction> I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.
</Instruction>
Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code

def f(s):
    return s + "a"

[Question]
What would be the return value of ```f("hi")```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[Answer]

The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

</Example>
Consider the following code
def f(sentences):
    if all([sentence.isdecimal() for sentence in sentences.split('.')]):
        return 'oscillating' 
    else:
        return 'not oscillating'
[Question]
What would be the return value of ```f('not numbers')```?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

[Answer]
The function f takes a string sentences as input and checks if all sentences in the string separated by '.' are decimal numbers. If all sentences are decimal numbers, it returns 'oscillating', otherwise it returns 'not oscillating'.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'not numbers', we need to check if all sentences in the string separated by '.' are decimal numbers. Since 'not numbers' contains a non-decimal number, the output of executing the function f on the input 'not numbers' is 'not oscillating'.

<<<Output>>>
'not oscillating'
