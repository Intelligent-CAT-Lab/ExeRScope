<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><Instruction> I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.
</Instruction>
Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code

def f(s):
    return s + "a"

[Question]
What would be the return value of ```f("hi")```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[Answer]

The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

</Example>
Consider the following code
def f(line):
    a = []
    for c in line:
        if c.isalnum():
            a.append(c)
    return ''.join(a)
[Question]
What would be the return value of ```f("\"\\%$ normal chars $%~ qwet42'")```?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

[Answer]
The function f takes a string line as input and returns a new string that only contains alphanumeric characters from the input string.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "\"\\%$ normal chars $%~ qwet42'", we need to iterate over each character in the input string and only append it to the new string if it is alphanumeric.

After iterating over all characters in the input string, the function joins the list of alphanumeric characters into a single string and returns it.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "\"\\%$ normal chars $%~ qwet42'" is "normalcharsqwet42".
<<<Output>>>
'normalcharsqwet42'
