<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><Instruction> I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code

def f(s):
    return s + "a"

[Question]
What would be the return value of ```f("hi")```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[Answer]

The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

</Example>
Consider the following code
def f(nums, pop1, pop2):
    nums.pop(pop1 - 1)
    nums.pop(pop2 - 1)
    return nums
[Question]
What would be the return value of ```f([1, 5, 2, 3, 6], 2, 4)```?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

[Answer]
The function f takes a list of numbers nums and two indices pop1 and pop2 as input. It removes the elements at the (pop1-1)th and (pop2-1)th indices from the list and returns the modified list.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input ([1, 5, 2, 3, 6], 2, 4), we need to remove the elements at the 1st and 3rd indices (0-based indexing) from the list [1, 5, 2, 3, 6].

After removing the elements, the list becomes [1, 5, 3, 6].

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input ([1, 5, 2, 3, 6], 2, 4) is [1, 5, 3, 6].
<<<Output>>>
[1, 5, 3, 6]
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
