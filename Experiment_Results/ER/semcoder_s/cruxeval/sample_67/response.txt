<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><Instruction> I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.
</Instruction>
Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code

def f(s):
    return s + "a"

[Question]
What would be the return value of ```f("hi")```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[Answer]

The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

</Example>
Consider the following code
def f(num1, num2, num3):
    nums = [num1, num2, num3]
    nums.sort()    
    return f'{nums[0]},{nums[1]},{nums[2]}'
[Question]
What would be the return value of ```f(6,8,8)```?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

[Answer]
The function f takes three integer parameters num1, num2, and num3. It creates a list containing these numbers, sorts the list in ascending order, and then returns a string with the sorted numbers separated by commas.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 6, 8, 8, we need to sort the numbers in ascending order and then concatenate them with commas.

After sorting the numbers, the list becomes [6, 8, 8].

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 6, 8, 8 is '6,8,8'.
<<<Output>>>
'6,8,8'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
