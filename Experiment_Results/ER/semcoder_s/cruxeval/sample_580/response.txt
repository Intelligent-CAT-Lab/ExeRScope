<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><Instruction> I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code

def f(s):
    return s + "a"

[Question]
What would be the return value of ```f("hi")```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[Answer]

The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

</Example>
Consider the following code
def f(text, char):
    new_text = text
    a = []
    while char in new_text:
        a.append(new_text.index(char))
        new_text = new_text.replace(char,"",1)
    return a
[Question]
What would be the return value of ```f('rvr', 'r')```?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

[Answer]
The function f takes two parameters: text and char. It creates an empty list a and a copy of the input text new_text. It then enters a while loop that continues as long as the character char is found in new_text.

Inside the loop, it appends the index of the first occurrence of char in new_text to list a, and then replaces the first occurrence of char in new_text with an empty string. This process continues until char is no longer found in new_text.

Finally, it returns the list a containing the indices of all occurrences of char in text.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input ('rvr', 'r'), we need to find the indices of 'r' in 'rvr'.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input ('rvr', 'r') is [0, 2].
<<<Output>>>
[0, 2]
