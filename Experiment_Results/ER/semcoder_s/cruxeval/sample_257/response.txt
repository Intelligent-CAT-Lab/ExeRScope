<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><Instruction> I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.
</Instruction>
Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code

def f(s):
    return s + "a"

[Question]
What would be the return value of ```f("hi")```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[Answer]

The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

</Example>
Consider the following code
def f(text):
    ls = []
    for x in text:
        ls.append(x.splitlines())
    return ls
[Question]
What would be the return value of ```f(['Hello World\n"I am String"'])```?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>

[Answer]
The function f takes a list of strings as input and returns a list of lists where each element of the list is a list of strings obtained by splitting each string in the input list.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input `['Hello World\n"I am String"']`, we need to split each string in the input list.

The string 'Hello World\n"I am String"' will be split into ['Hello World', '"I am String"'] and this list will be the element of the output list.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input `['Hello World\n"I am String"']` is `[['Hello World', '"I am String"']]`.

<<<Output>>>
[['Hello World', '"I am String"']]
