<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><Instruction> I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.
</Instruction>
Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code

def f(s):
    return s + "a"

[Question]
What would be the return value of ```f("hi")```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[Answer]

The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

</Example>
Consider the following code
def f(in_list, num):
    in_list.append(num)
    return in_list.index(max(in_list[:-1]))
[Question]
What would be the return value of ```f([-1, 12, -6, -2], -1)```?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

[Answer]
The function f takes a list of integers in_list and an integer num as input. It appends num to the list and returns the index of the maximum value in the list excluding the last element.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input `[-1, 12, -6, -2], -1`, we need to:
- Append -1 to the list `[-1, 12, -6, -2, -1]`.
- Find the maximum value in the list excluding the last element, which is `12`.
- Return the index of `12` in the list, which is `1`.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input `[-1, 12, -6, -2], -1` is `1`.
<<<Output>>>
1
