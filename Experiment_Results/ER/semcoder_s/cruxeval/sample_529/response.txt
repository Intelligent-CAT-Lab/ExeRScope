<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><Instruction> I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.
</Instruction>
Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code

def f(s):
    return s + "a"

[Question]
What would be the return value of ```f("hi")```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[Answer]

The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

</Example>
Consider the following code
def f(array):
    prev = array[0]
    newArray = array[:]
    for i in range(1, len(array)):
        if prev != array[i]:
            newArray[i] = array[i]
        else:
            del newArray[i]
        prev = array[i]
    return newArray
[Question]
What would be the return value of ```f([1, 2, 3])```?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

[Answer]
The function f takes an array as input and returns a new array where all consecutive duplicate elements are removed.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 2, 3], we need to iterate through the array and remove any consecutive duplicates.

The first element is 1, the second element is 2, which is different from the first, so we keep it.
The third element is 3, which is different from the second, so we keep it.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 2, 3] is [1, 2, 3].
<<<Output>>>
[1, 2, 3]
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
