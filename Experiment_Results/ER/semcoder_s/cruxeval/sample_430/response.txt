<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><Instruction> I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.
</Instruction>
Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code

def f(s):
    return s + "a"

[Question]
What would be the return value of ```f("hi")```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[Answer]

The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

</Example>
Consider the following code
def f(arr1, arr2):
    new_arr = arr1.copy()
    new_arr.extend(arr2)
    return new_arr
[Question]
What would be the return value of ```f([5, 1, 3, 7, 8], ['', 0, -1, []])```?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

[Answer]
The function f takes two lists arr1 and arr2 as input. It creates a new list new_arr by copying arr1. Then it extends new_arr with arr2. Finally, it returns the new list.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input ([5, 1, 3, 7, 8], ['', 0, -1, []]), we need to create a new list by copying the first list and then extending it with the second list.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input ([5, 1, 3, 7, 8], ['', 0, -1, []]) is [5, 1, 3, 7, 8, '', 0, -1, []].
<<<Output>>>
[5, 1, 3, 7, 8, '', 0, -1, []]
