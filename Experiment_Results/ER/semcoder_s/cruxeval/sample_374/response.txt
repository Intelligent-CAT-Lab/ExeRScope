<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><Instruction> I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code

def f(s):
    return s + "a"

[Question]
What would be the return value of ```f("hi")```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[Answer]

The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

</Example>
Consider the following code
def f(seq, v):
    a = []
    for i in seq:
        if i.endswith(v):
            a.append(i*2)
    return a
[Question]
What would be the return value of ```f([ 'oH', 'ee', 'mb', 'deft', 'n', 'zz', 'f', 'abA' ], 'zz')```?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

[Answer]
The function f takes a list of strings and a string v as input. It creates an empty list a and then iterates over each string in the list. If the string ends with the input string v, it appends the string doubled to the list a. Finally, it returns the list a.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input ([ 'oH', 'ee', 'mb', 'deft', 'n', 'zz', 'f', 'abA' ], 'zz'), we need to find all strings in the list that end with 'zz', double them, and return them in a list.

The strings that end with 'zz' in the input list are 'oH' and 'zz'. Doubling them gives ['oHzz', 'zz'].

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input ([ 'oH', 'ee', 'mb', 'deft', 'n', 'zz', 'f', 'abA' ], 'zz') is ['oHzz', 'zz'].
<<<Output>>>
['oHzz', 'zz']
