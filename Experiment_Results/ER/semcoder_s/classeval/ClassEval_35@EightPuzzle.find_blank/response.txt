<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><Instruction> I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a Python class and you need to predict the return value of a function defined in the class. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code

import unittest
import itertools

class ArrangementCalculator:
    def __init__(self, datas):
        self.datas = datas

    @staticmethod
    def count(n, m=None):
        if m is None or n == m:
            return ArrangementCalculator.factorial(n)
        else:
            return ArrangementCalculator.factorial(n) // ArrangementCalculator.factorial(n - m)

    @staticmethod
    def count_all(n):
        total = 0
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            total += ArrangementCalculator.count(n, i)
        return total

    def select(self, m=None):
        if m is None:
            m = len(self.datas)
        result = []
        for permutation in itertools.permutations(self.datas, m):
            result.append(list(permutation))
        return result

    def select_all(self):
        result = []
        for i in range(1, len(self.datas) + 1):
            result.extend(self.select(i))
        return result

    @staticmethod
    def factorial(n):
        result = 1
        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            result *= i
        return result
class Test(unittest.TestCase):
    def test(self):
            res = ArrangementCalculator.factorial(6)
            return res

[Question]
What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[Answer]

Inside the test() method, the ArrangementCalculator.factorial(6) method is invoked. The purpose of this method is to calculate the factorial of a given number n. In this case, n = 6.
Inside the factorial(), the variable result is initialized to 1.
A for loop iterates from 2 to n (which is 6 in this case), multiplying result by each integer in the range.
At the start: result = 1
The first iteration: i=2, result = 1 * 2 = 2
The second iteration: i=3, result = 2 * 3 = 6
The Third iteration: i=4, result = 6 * 4 = 24
The Forth iteration: i=5, result = 24 * 5 = 120
The Sixth iteration: result = 120 * 6 = 720
After the loop completes, the method returns result, which is 720.
<<<Output>>>
720

[Answer]

Inside the test() method, the EightPuzzle object is created with a specific initial state. The find_blank() method is then called on this initial state.

The find_blank() method iterates over the 2D list (representing the state of the 8-puzzle) to find the position of the blank tile (represented by 0).

In this case, the initial state is [[2, 3, 4], [5, 8, 1], [6, 8, 7]]. The blank tile is at position (1, 2), which corresponds to the row index 1 and the column index 2.

Therefore, the return value of find_blank(state) would be (1, 2).

<<<Output>>>
(1, 2)
