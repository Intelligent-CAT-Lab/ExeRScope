Inside the test() method, a BinaryDataProcessor object is created with a binary string "0sd1000daf3e4r01100101011011addf0110001d1111".
The binary string is cleaned by removing any characters that are not '0' or '1'.
The cleaned binary string is "00100001000011010001000010000110100011000010000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000110000
