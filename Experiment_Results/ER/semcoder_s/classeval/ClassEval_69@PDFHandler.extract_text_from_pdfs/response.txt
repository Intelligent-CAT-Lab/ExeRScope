<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><Instruction> I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a Python class and you need to predict the return value of a function defined in the class. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code

import unittest
import itertools

class ArrangementCalculator:
    def __init__(self, datas):
        self.datas = datas

    @staticmethod
    def count(n, m=None):
        if m is None or n == m:
            return ArrangementCalculator.factorial(n)
        else:
            return ArrangementCalculator.factorial(n) // ArrangementCalculator.factorial(n - m)

    @staticmethod
    def count_all(n):
        total = 0
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            total += ArrangementCalculator.count(n, i)
        return total

    def select(self, m=None):
        if m is None:
            m = len(self.datas)
        result = []
        for permutation in itertools.permutations(self.datas, m):
            result.append(list(permutation))
        return result

    def select_all(self):
        result = []
        for i in range(1, len(self.datas) + 1):
            result.extend(self.select(i))
        return result

    @staticmethod
    def factorial(n):
        result = 1
        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            result *= i
        return result
class Test(unittest.TestCase):
    def test(self):
            res = ArrangementCalculator.factorial(6)
            return res

[Question]
What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}

[Answer]

Inside the test() method, the ArrangementCalculator.factorial(6) method is invoked. The purpose of this method is to calculate the factorial of a given number n. In this case, n = 6.
Inside the factorial(), the variable result is initialized to 1.
A for loop iterates from 2 to n (which is 6 in this case), multiplying result by each integer in the range.
At the start: result = 1
The first iteration: i=2, result = 1 * 2 = 2
The second iteration: i=3, result = 2 * 3 = 6
The Third iteration: i=4, result = 6 * 4 = 24
The Forth iteration: i=5, result = 24 * 5 = 120
The Sixth iteration: result = 120 * 6 = 720
After the loop completes, the method returns result, which is 720.
<<<Output>>>
720

Consider the following code
import unittest
import PyPDF2


class PDFHandler:
    def __init__(self, filepaths):
        self.filepaths = filepaths
        # PdfFileReader is deprecated and was removed in PyPDF2 3.0.0. Use PdfReader instead.
        self.readers = [PyPDF2.PdfReader(fp) for fp in filepaths]

    def merge_pdfs(self, output_filepath):
        pdf_writer = PyPDF2.PdfWriter()

        for reader in self.readers:
            # reader.getNumPages is deprecated and was removed in PyPDF2 3.0.0. Use len(reader.pages) instead.
            for page_num in range(len(reader.pages)):
                # reader.getPage(pageNumber) is deprecated and was removed in PyPDF2 3.0.0. Use reader.pages[page_number] instead.
                page = reader.pages[page_num]
                # addPage is deprecated and was removed in PyPDF2 3.0.0. Use add_page instead.
                pdf_writer.add_page(page)

        with open(output_filepath, 'wb') as out:
            pdf_writer.write(out)
        return f"Merged PDFs saved at {output_filepath}"

    def extract_text_from_pdfs(self):
        pdf_texts = []
        for reader in self.readers:
            for page_num in range(len(reader.pages)):
                page = reader.pages[page_num]
                pdf_texts.append(page.extract_text())
        return pdf_texts

            TestPDFHandler.setUpClass()
            handler = PDFHandler(TestPDFHandler.test_files)
            result = handler.merge_pdfs("merged.pdf")
            return result,os.path.exists('merged.pdf')

[Answer]
The test() method in the Test class is being called. Inside this method, an instance of PDFHandler is created with the test_files attribute of TestPDFHandler class. The merge_pdfs() method is then called on this instance, passing "merged.pdf" as the output file path. The method returns a message indicating that the merged PDFs were saved at the specified location.

The return value of the test() method is a tuple containing the message returned by merge_pdfs() and a boolean indicating whether a file named 'merged.pdf' exists in the current directory.

<<<Output>>>
('Merged PDFs saved at merged.pdf', True)
