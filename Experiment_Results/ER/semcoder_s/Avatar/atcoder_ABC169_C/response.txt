<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><Instruction> I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.
</Instruction>
Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code

N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

[Question]
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
````20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[Answer]

<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

</Example>
Consider the following code
a , b = input ( ) . split ( )
b = b [ 0 ] + b [ 2 : ]
a = int ( a )
b = int ( b )
print ( a * b // 100 )
[Question]
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
````814793613347395 1.99```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}

[Answer]
<<<Analysis>>>
The input is split into two parts: a (integer) and b (float). The float b is converted to a string, and the first character and the characters after the second character are concatenated to form a new string. This new string is then converted to an integer and stored in b. The integer a is multiplied by b and then divided by 100 to get the final result.

For the given input:
a = 814793613347395
b = 199

After the conversion, b becomes:
b = 199

Then, a is multiplied by b:
a * b = 814793613347395 * 199 = 153793613347395475

Finally, this result is divided by 100:
153793613347395475 / 100 = 15379361334739547.5

The output is the integer part of this result, which is 15379361334739547.
<<<Output>>>
15379361334739547
