<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><Instruction> I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.
</Instruction>
Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code

N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

[Question]
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
````20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[Answer]

<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code
numbers = list ( map ( int , input ( ) . split ( ) ) )
start = 0
arr = [ ]
count = 0
for i in range ( 0 , numbers [ 0 ] ) :
    string = " "
    next = start
    for j in range ( 0 , numbers [ 0 ] ) :
        if count < numbers [ 1 ] :
            if j == next :
                string += 'L'
                count += 1
                next += 2
                if next >= numbers [ 0 ] :
                    start = 1 if start == 0 else 0
            else :
                string += "S"
        else :
            string += "S"
    arr . append ( string )

    print ( "NO" )

    print ( "YES" )
    for i in arr :
        print ( i )
[Question]
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
````100 10000```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

{YOUR ANALYSIS}

[Answer]
<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an input of two numbers, separated by a space. The first number is the total number of elements in the array, and the second number is the total number of 'L's that can be present in the array.

The code then creates an empty list 'arr' and initializes 'start' to 0 and 'count' to 0.

The code then enters a loop that iterates 'numbers[0]' times. In each iteration, it creates a string 'string' and sets 'next' to 'start'.

The code then enters another loop that iterates 'numbers[0]' times. In each iteration, it checks if 'count' is less than 'numbers[1]'. If it is, it checks if the current index 'j' is equal to 'next'. If it is, it adds 'L' to 'string', increments 'count' by 1, increments 'next' by 2, and changes 'start' to 1 if 'start' is 0, or to 0 if 'start' is 1. If 'next' is greater than or equal to 'numbers[0]', it wraps around to the beginning of the array. If 'j' is not equal to 'next', it adds 'S' to 'string'.

After the loops finish, if 'count' is still less than 'numbers[1]', it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' and then prints each string in 'arr'.

Since 'numbers[1]' is greater than 'numbers[0]', it will print 'NO' because not enough 'L's can be present in the array.
<<<Output>>>
NO
