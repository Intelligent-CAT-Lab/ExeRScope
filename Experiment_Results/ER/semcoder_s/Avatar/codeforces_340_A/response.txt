<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><Instruction> I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.
</Instruction>
Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code

N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

[Question]
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
````20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[Answer]

<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

84

Consider the following code
def GCD ( a , b ) :
    while a % b != 0 :
        a , b = b , a % b
    return b
def LCM ( a , b ) :
    return a * b // GCD ( a , b )
l = input ( ) . split ( ' ' )
x , y , a , b = int ( l [ 0 ] ) , int ( l [ 1 ] ) , int ( l [ 2 ] ) , int ( l [ 3 ] )
lcm = LCM ( x , y )
print ( b // lcm - ( a - 1 ) // lcm )

What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
````1 1 1 1000000000```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

[Answer]
<<<Analysis>>>
The input is split into four parts: 1, 1, 1, and 1000000000. These are assigned to x, y, a, and b respectively.

The function GCD is defined to find the greatest common divisor of two numbers. It does this by continuously replacing a and b with b and a mod b until a mod b equals 0. At this point, b is the GCD of the original a and b.

The function LCM is defined to find the least common multiple of two numbers. It does this by multiplying a and b and then dividing by their GCD.

The least common multiple of x and y is calculated and stored in lcm.

The output is calculated by subtracting (a-1)//lcm from b//lcm. This is equivalent to finding the number of multiples of the least common multiple that are less than a and the number of multiples of the least common multiple that are less than or equal to b.

The output is the difference between these two quantities.
