<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><Instruction> I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.
</Instruction>
Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code

N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

[Question]
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
````20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[Answer]

<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

</Example>
Consider the following code
ip = input ( )
st = " "
if len ( ip ) != 1 :
    if ip [ 0 ] == "9" :
        st = "9"
        ip = ip [ 1 : ]
    for i in ip :
        if int ( i ) > 4 :
            n = 9 - int ( i )
            st += str ( n )
        else :
            st += i
else :
    st = ip
print ( int ( st ) )
[Question]
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
````5728```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

[Answer]
<<<Analysis>>>
The input is a string "5728". The code checks if the length of the string is not equal to 1. If it's not, it checks if the first character is '9'. If it is, it replaces '9' with an empty string and updates the string. Then it iterates through each character in the string. If the character is greater than '4', it calculates the difference between '9' and the character, converts it to a string and appends it to the new string. If the character is less than or equal to '4', it appends the character to the new string.

After the loop, the code prints the integer value of the new string.

<<<Output>>>
4211
