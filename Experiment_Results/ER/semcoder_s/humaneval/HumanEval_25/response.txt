<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><Instruction> I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code

def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1

[Question]
What would be the return value of ```sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

<<<Analysis>>>
The function `factorize` takes an integer `n` as input and returns a list of its factors.

The function starts by initializing an empty list `fact` to store the factors of `n`.

It then initializes a variable `i` to 2, which will be used to divide `n`.

The function enters a loop that continues until `i` is greater than the square root of `n`.

Inside the loop, it checks if `n` is divisible by `i`. If it is, `i` is a factor of `n` and is added to `fact`. `n` is then divided by `i`.

If `n` is not divisible by `i`, `i` is incremented by 1.

After the loop finishes, if `n` is greater than 1, it means `n` is a prime number greater than the square root of the original `n`, and it is added to `fact`.

Finally, the function returns the list of factors `fact`.

For `factorize(2)`, the function returns `[2]`.
<<<Output>>>
[2]
