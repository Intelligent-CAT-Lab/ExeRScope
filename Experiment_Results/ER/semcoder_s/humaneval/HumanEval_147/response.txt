<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><Instruction> I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code

def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1

[Question]
What would be the return value of ```sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

84

[Answer]
<<<Analysis>>>
The function `get_max_triples` takes an integer `n` as input and calculates the sequence `A` based on the formula `A[i] = i^2 - i + 1` for `i` from 1 to `n`.

Then, it iterates through all possible triplets of indices `(i, j, k)` such that `i < j < k`. For each triplet, it checks if the sum of the elements at the indices `i`, `j`, and `k` in the sequence `A` is divisible by 3. If it is, it adds the triplet to the list `ans`.

Finally, it returns the length of the list `ans`, which represents the number of triplets in the sequence `A` that satisfy the condition.

For `n = 5`, the sequence `A` is `[1, 4, 9, 16, 25]`. The possible triplets are `(1, 4, 9)`, `(1, 4, 16)`, `(1, 4, 25)`, `(1, 9, 16)`, `(1, 9, 25)`, `(1, 16, 25)`, `(4, 9, 16)`, `(4, 9, 25)`, `(4, 16, 25)`, `(9, 16, 25)`.

Of these, only `(1, 4, 9)` and `(1, 9, 16)` satisfy the condition that their sum is divisible by 3. Therefore, the return value is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
