<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><Instruction> I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code

def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1

[Question]
What would be the return value of ```sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

    my_tri = [1, 3]
    for i in range(2, n + 1):

        else:
            my_tri.append(my_tri[i - 1] + my_tri[i - 2] + (i + 3) / 2)
    return my_tri

What would be the return value of ```tri(3) ```?

[Answer]
<<<Analysis>>>
The function `tri` takes an integer `n` as input and returns a list of integers.

The base case is when `n` is 0, in which case the function returns `[1]`.

For `n` greater than 0, the function initializes `my_tri` with the first two elements as `[1, 3]`.

Then it enters a loop that iterates from 2 to `n` (inclusive).

If `i` is even, it appends `i / 2 + 1` to `my_tri`.

If `i` is odd, it appends `my_tri[i - 1] + my_tri[i - 2] + (i + 3) / 2` to `my_tri`.

Finally, it returns the list `my_tri`.

For `n = 3`, the function will return `[1, 3, 4, 10]`.
<<<Output>>>
[1, 3, 4, 10]
