<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><Instruction> I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.
</Instruction>
Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code

def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1

[Question]
What would be the return value of ```sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code
from typing import *
def get_closest_vowel(word):
    if len(word) < 3:
        return ""

    vowels = {"a", "e", "i", "o", "u", "A", "E", 'O', 'U', 'I'}
    for i in range(len(word)-2, 0, -1):
        if word[i] in vowels:
            if (word[i+1] not in vowels) and (word[i-1] not in vowels):
                return word[i]
    return ""
[Question]
What would be the return value of ```get_closest_vowel("yogurt") ```?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

[Answer]
<<<Analysis>>>
The function `get_closest_vowel` takes a string `word` as input. If the length of the word is less than 3, it returns an empty string.

The set `vowels` contains all the vowels in lower and upper case.

The function then iterates over the word in reverse order, starting from the third character (index 2) up to the first character. For each character, it checks if the character and its neighbors are not vowels. If this condition is met, it returns the character.

If no such character is found after iterating over the whole word, the function returns an empty string.

In the word "yogurt", the character "u" is a vowel, and "r" and "t" are also vowels. Therefore, the function will return an empty string.
<<<Output>>>
""
