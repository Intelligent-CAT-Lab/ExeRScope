<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><Instruction> I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code

def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1

[Question]
What would be the return value of ```sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

<<<Analysis>>>
The function `Strongest_Extension` takes two parameters: `class_name` and `extensions`.

The variable `strong` is initialized to the first extension in the list, which is 'tEN'.

The variable `my_val` is calculated by counting the number of uppercase letters minus the number of lowercase letters in the first extension. In this case, 'tEN' has 1 uppercase letter and 1 lowercase letter, so `my_val` is 1.

The function then iterates over the remaining extensions in the list. For each extension, it calculates a value `val` by counting the number of uppercase letters minus the number of lowercase letters. If `val` is greater than `my_val`, the extension becomes the new `strong` and `my_val` is updated to `val`.

Finally, the function concatenates `class_name` with the strongest extension and returns the result.

In this case, the strongest extension is 'eIGHt8OKe' with a value of 2 (2 uppercase letters and 0 lowercase letters). So, the function will return 'Watashi.eIGHt8OKe'.

<<<Output>>>
'Watashi.eIGHt8OKe'
