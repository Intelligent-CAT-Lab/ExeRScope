<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><Instruction> I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.
</Instruction>
Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code

def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1

[Question]
What would be the return value of ```sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[Answer]

<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code
from typing import *
def circular_shift(x, shift):
    s = str(x)
    if shift > len(s):
        return s[::-1]
    else:
        return s[len(s) - shift:] + s[:len(s) - shift]
[Question]
What would be the return value of ```circular_shift(100, 2) ```?

[Answer]
<<<Analysis>>>
The function circular_shift takes two arguments: x and shift. x is the number to be shifted and shift is the amount by which to shift it.
The number x is converted to a string and stored in s.
If the shift is greater than the length of s, the entire string is reversed and returned.
Otherwise, the string is shifted by slicing it into two parts and reassembling them in the opposite order.
The first part of the string (from the end to the shift position) is added to the end of the second part of the string (from the start to the shift position).
<<<Output>>>
