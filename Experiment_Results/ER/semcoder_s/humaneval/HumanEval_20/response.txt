<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><Instruction> I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.
</Instruction>
Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code

def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1

[Question]
What would be the return value of ```sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code
from typing import *
def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]) -> Tuple[float, float]:
    closest_pair = None
    distance = None

    for idx, elem in enumerate(numbers):
        for idx2, elem2 in enumerate(numbers):
            if idx != idx2:
                if distance is None:
                    distance = abs(elem - elem2)
                    closest_pair = tuple(sorted([elem, elem2]))
                else:
                    new_distance = abs(elem - elem2)
                    if new_distance < distance:
                        distance = new_distance
                        closest_pair = tuple(sorted([elem, elem2]))

    return closest_pair
[Question]
What would be the return value of ```find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2]) ```?

[Answer]
<<<Analysis>>>
The function `find_closest_elements` takes a list of floating point numbers as input. It initializes `closest_pair` and `distance` to `None`.

The function then iterates over the list of numbers. For each pair of numbers, it calculates the absolute difference and checks if it's less than the current minimum difference. If it is, it updates the minimum difference and the closest pair.

Finally, the function returns the closest pair of numbers.

For the input `[1.0, 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2]`, the closest pair of numbers will be `(2.0, 2.2)` with a difference of `0.2`.
<<<Output>>>
(2.0, 2.2)
