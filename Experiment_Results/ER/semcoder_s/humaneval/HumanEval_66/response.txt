<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><Instruction> I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.
</Instruction>
Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code

def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1

[Question]
What would be the return value of ```sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

[Answer]

<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

    return sum(ord(char) if char.isupper() else 0 for char in s)

What would be the return value of ```digitSum("You arE Very Smart") ```?

[Answer]
<<<Analysis>>>
The function `digitSum` takes a string as input. If the string is empty, it returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates the sum of ASCII values of uppercase characters in the string.

The ASCII values of uppercase characters are calculated using the `ord` function. If a character is not an uppercase letter, it returns 0.

The sum of these ASCII values is calculated using the `sum` function.

For the input "You arE Very Smart", the uppercase letters are 'Y', 'A', 'E', 'V', 'R', 'S', 'M', 'A', 'R', 'T'.

The ASCII values of these letters are 89, 65, 69, 86, 82, 83, 77, 65, 82, 84.

The sum of these ASCII values is 719.
<<<Output>>>
719
