<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><Instruction> I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.
</Instruction>
Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code

def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1

[Question]
What would be the return value of ```sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

[Answer]

<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code
from typing import *
def change_base(x: int, base: int):
    ret = ""
    while x > 0:
        ret = str(x % base) + ret
        x //= base
    return ret
[Question]
What would be the return value of ```change_base(8, 3) ```?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

[Answer]
<<<Analysis>>>
The function change_base takes two arguments: x (the number to be converted) and base (the base to which the number is to be converted).
The function starts by initializing an empty string ret.
It then enters a loop that continues as long as x is greater than 0.
In each iteration of the loop, it calculates the remainder of x divided by base (x % base) and prepends it to the string ret.
The value of x is then updated to be the floor division of x by base (x //= base).
This loop continues until x becomes 0, at which point the function returns the final value of ret.

For the input change_base(8, 3), the function calculates:
8 % 3 = 2, ret = "2"
8 // 3 = 2, x = 2
2 % 3 = 2, ret = "22"
2 // 3 = 0, x = 0

Therefore, the function returns "22".
<<<Output>>>
"22"
