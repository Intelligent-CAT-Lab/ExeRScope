<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><Instruction> I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.
</Instruction>
Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code

def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1

[Question]
What would be the return value of ```sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[Answer]

<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code
from typing import *
def find_max(words):
    return sorted(words, key = lambda x: (-len(set(x)), x))[0]
[Question]
What would be the return value of ```find_max(["name", "of", "string"])```?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

[Answer]
<<<Analysis>>>
The function find_max takes a list of words as input.
The lambda function inside the sorted function is used to sort the words based on two criteria:
1. The length of the set of unique characters in the word in descending order.
2. The word itself in ascending order.
The sorted function returns a list of words sorted according to the criteria.
The function then returns the first word in the sorted list, which is the word with the maximum unique characters and the smallest lexicographical order.

For the input `["name", "of", "string"]`, the sorted list would be `["string", "name", "of"]`.
The first word in the sorted list is `"string"`.
<<<Output>>>
"string"
