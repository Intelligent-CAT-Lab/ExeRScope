<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><Instruction> I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.
</Instruction>
Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code

def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1

[Question]
What would be the return value of ```sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

[Answer]

<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

<<<Analysis>>>
The function `words_in_sentence` takes a sentence as input and processes it word by word.

For each word in the sentence, it checks if the length of the word is 1 or 2. If it is, it adds the word to the new list `new_lst`.

If the length of the word is greater than 2, it checks if the length of the word is divisible by any number from 2 to the length of the word - 1. If it is divisible, it sets the flag `flg` to 1.

If the flag `flg` is still 0 after checking all possible divisors, it adds the word to the `new_lst`.

Finally, it joins all the words in `new_lst` with a space and returns the resulting string.

For the input "This is a test", the words "This", "is", "a", "test" are all added to the `new_lst` because they are neither of length 1 nor divisible by any number from 2 to length - 1.

Therefore, the output of the function will be "This is a test".
<<<Output>>>
"This is a test"
