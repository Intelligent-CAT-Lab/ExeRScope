<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><Instruction> I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.
</Instruction>
Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code

def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1

[Question]
What would be the return value of ```sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code
from typing import *
def sum_squares(lst):
    result =[]
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        if i %3 == 0:
            result.append(lst[i]**2)
        elif i % 4 == 0 and i%3 != 0:
            result.append(lst[i]**3)
        else:
            result.append(lst[i])
    return sum(result)

What would be the return value of ```sum_squares([1,2,3]) ```?

[Answer]
<<<Analysis>>>
The function `sum_squares` takes a list `lst` as input. It initializes an empty list `result`.

The function then enters a loop that iterates over the indices of `lst`. For each index `i`, it checks the following conditions:

1. If `i` is a multiple of 3, it squares `lst[i]` and appends the result to `result`.
2. If `i` is a multiple of 4 and not a multiple of 3, it cubes `lst[i]` and appends the result to `result`.
3. If `i` is neither a multiple of 3 nor a multiple of 4, it appends `lst[i]` as it is to `result`.

Finally, the function returns the sum of all elements in `result`.

For the input `[1,2,3]`, the output will be `1 + 2^2 + 3^2 = 1 + 4 + 9 = 14`.

14
