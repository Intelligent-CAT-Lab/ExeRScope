<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><Instruction> I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.
</Instruction>
Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code

def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1

[Question]
What would be the return value of ```sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[Answer]

<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code
from typing import *
def all_prefixes(string: str) -> List[str]:
    result = []

    for i in range(len(string)):
        result.append(string[:i+1])
    return result
[Question]
What would be the return value of ```all_prefixes('asdfgh') ```?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

[Answer]
<<<Analysis>>>
The function `all_prefixes` takes a string as input and returns a list of all prefixes of the string.

The function initializes an empty list `result` to store the prefixes.

Then it enters a loop that iterates from 0 to the length of the string. For each iteration, it takes a slice of the string from the start up to the current index (inclusive), and appends it to the `result` list.

After the loop finishes, the function returns the `result` list, which contains all the prefixes of the input string.

For the input 'asdfgh', the function will return ['a', 'as', 'asd', 'asdf', 'asdfg', 'asdfgh'].
<<<Output>>>
['a', 'as', 'asd', 'asdf', 'asdfg', 'asdfgh']
