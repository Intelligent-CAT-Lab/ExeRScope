<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><Instruction> I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code

def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1

[Question]
What would be the return value of ```sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

    closing_bracket_index.reverse()
    cnt = 0
    i = 0
    l = len(closing_bracket_index)
    for idx in opening_bracket_index:
        if i < l and idx < closing_bracket_index[i]:
            cnt += 1
            i += 1
    return cnt >= 2

<<<Analysis>>>
The function is_nested takes a string as input and checks if it is a nested string.
It initializes two empty lists, opening_bracket_index and closing_bracket_index, to store the indices of opening and closing brackets respectively.
It then iterates over the string and appends the indices of opening brackets to opening_bracket_index and indices of closing brackets to closing_bracket_index.
The closing_bracket_index list is then reversed to match the order of closing brackets from last to first.
A counter variable cnt is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of nested brackets.
An index variable i is initialized to 0, which will be used to match the opening and closing brackets.
The function then iterates over the opening_bracket_index list and checks if the current opening bracket index is before the corresponding closing bracket index.
If it is, it increments the counter cnt and moves to the next closing bracket index.
Finally, the function returns True if cnt is greater than or equal to 2, indicating that there are at least two nested brackets, and False otherwise.
<<<Output>>>
True
