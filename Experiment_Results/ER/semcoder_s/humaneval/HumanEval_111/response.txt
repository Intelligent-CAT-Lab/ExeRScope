<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><Instruction> I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.
</Instruction>
Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code

def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1

[Question]
What would be the return value of ```sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

[Answer]

<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

from typing import *
def histogram(test):

    list1=test.split(" ")
    t=0

    for i in list1:
        if(list1.count(i)>t) and i!='':
            t=list1.count(i)
    if t>0:
        for i in list1:
            if(list1.count(i)==t):
                
                dict1[i]=t
    return dict1
[Question]
What would be the return value of ```histogram('a b b a') ```?

[Answer]
<<<Analysis>>>
The function histogram takes a string as input and returns a dictionary with the frequency of each word in the string.

The string 'a b b a' is split into a list of words: ['a', 'b', 'b', 'a'].

The frequency of each word is counted using list1.count(i), and the maximum frequency is found.

If the maximum frequency is greater than 0, then for each word in the list, if the frequency equals the maximum frequency, the word and its frequency are added to the dictionary dict1.

The function returns dict1, which is {'a': 2, 'b': 2}.
<<<Output>>>
{'a': 2, 'b': 2}
