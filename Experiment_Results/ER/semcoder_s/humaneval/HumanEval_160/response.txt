<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><Instruction> I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.
</Instruction>
Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code

def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1

[Question]
What would be the return value of ```sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

[Answer]

<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code
from typing import *
def do_algebra(operator, operand):
    expression = str(operand[0])
    for oprt, oprn in zip(operator, operand[1:]):
        expression+= oprt + str(oprn)
    return eval(expression)
[Question]
What would be the return value of ```do_algebra(['**', '*', '+'], [2, 3, 4, 5]) ```?

[Answer]
<<<Analysis>>>
The function `do_algebra` takes two arguments: `operator` and `operand`. 
The `operator` is a list of strings that represent the operations to be performed. The `operand` is a list of integers that are the operands for the operations.

The function starts by converting the first operand to a string and storing it in the variable `expression`.

Then, it iterates over the `operator` and `operand` lists in parallel, starting from the second operand. For each pair of operator and operand, it appends the operator and the operand (converted to a string) to the `expression`.

Finally, it evaluates the `expression` using the `eval` function and returns the result.

The `eval` function is used here to evaluate the expression dynamically. This means that the function can handle any expression that can be formed by the operators and operands provided.

For the given input `do_algebra(['**', '*', '+'], [2, 3, 4, 5])`, the expression that will be evaluated is `'2**3*4+5'`. This expression is evaluated as follows:
- `2**3` is `8`
- `8*4` is `32`
- `32+5` is `37`

Therefore, the return value of the function will be `37`.
<<<Output>>>
37
