<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><Instruction> I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.
</Instruction>
Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code

def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1

[Question]
What would be the return value of ```sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

[Answer]

<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code
from typing import *
def sum_squares(lst):
    import math
    squared = 0
    for i in lst:
        squared += math.ceil(i)**2
    return squared
[Question]
What would be the return value of ```sum_squares([1,2,3])```?

<<<Analysis>>>
The function `sum_squares` takes a list of numbers as input. It initializes a variable `squared` to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of squares of the numbers in the list.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each number in the list. For each number, it calculates the square of the ceiling of the number (the smallest integer not less than the number), and adds it to `squared`.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of `squared`, which is the sum of squares of the numbers in the list.

For the input `[1,2,3]`, the numbers in the list are 1, 2, and 3. The ceilings of these numbers are 1, 2, and 3 respectively. The squares of these ceilings are 1, 4, and 9. The sum of these squares is 1 + 4 + 9 = 14.
<<<Output>>>
14
