<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><Instruction> I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.
</Instruction>
Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code

def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1

[Question]
What would be the return value of ```sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}

[Answer]

<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code
from typing import *
def file_name_check(file_name):
    suf = ['txt', 'exe', 'dll']
    lst = file_name.split(sep='.')
    if len(lst) != 2:
        return 'No'
    if not lst[1] in suf:
        return 'No'
    if len(lst[0]) == 0:
        return 'No'
    if not lst[0][0].isalpha():
        return 'No'
    t = len([x for x in lst[0] if x.isdigit()])
    if t > 3:
        return 'No'
    return 'Yes'

What would be the return value of ```file_name_check("example.txt") ```?

<<<Analysis>>>
The function `file_name_check` takes a file name as input and checks if it meets certain conditions.
The file name is split into two parts using the dot as a separator. If there are not exactly two parts, the function returns 'No'.
The second part (extension) is checked to be in the list `suf` ['txt', 'exe', 'dll']. If it is not, the function returns 'No'.
If the first part (name) is empty, the function returns 'No'.
If the first character of the name is not an alphabet, the function returns 'No'.
The function counts the number of digits in the name part. If there are more than 3 digits, the function returns 'No'.
If all the conditions are met, the function returns 'Yes'.

For the input "example.txt", the name part is "example" and the extension part is "txt". Both conditions are met, so the function returns 'Yes'.
<<<Output>>>
'Yes'
