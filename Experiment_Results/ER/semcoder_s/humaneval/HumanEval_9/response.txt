<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><Instruction> I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.
</Instruction>
Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code

def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1

[Question]
What would be the return value of ```sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code
from typing import *
def rolling_max(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    running_max = None
    result = []

    for n in numbers:
        if running_max is None:
            running_max = n
        else:
            running_max = max(running_max, n)

        result.append(running_max)

    return result
[Question]
What would be the return value of ```rolling_max([3,2,3,100,3]) ```?

[Answer]
<<<Analysis>>>
The function `rolling_max` takes a list of integers as input. It initializes two variables: `running_max` to `None` and `result` to an empty list.

The function then iterates over each number in the input list. For each number, it checks if `running_max` is `None`. If it is, it assigns the current number to `running_max`. If `running_max` is not `None`, it updates `running_max` to be the maximum of the current number and the previous `running_max`.

After each iteration, it appends the current `running_max` to the `result` list.

Finally, it returns the `result` list, which contains the maximum value up to that point in the input list for each number.

For the input `[3,2,3,100,3]`, the output would be `[3, 3, 3, 100, 100]`.
<<<Output>>>
[3, 3, 3, 100, 100]
