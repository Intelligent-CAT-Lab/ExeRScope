The function `f` takes a dictionary `my_dict` as input. It then uses a dictionary comprehension to create a new dictionary `result`. 

Here's how the dictionary comprehension works:

1. **Iterate through key-value pairs:** It iterates through each key-value pair (`k`, `v`) in the input dictionary `my_dict.items()`.
2. **Swap keys and values:** For each key-value pair, it creates a new key-value pair in `result` where the value `v` becomes the key, and the key `k` becomes the value. 
3. **Handle duplicate values:** Since dictionaries cannot have duplicate keys, if there are duplicate values in the original dictionary, the last key encountered for that value will be the one present in the resulting dictionary.

Finally, the function returns the newly created dictionary `result`.

Applying this to the input `{'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3, 'd': 2}`:

1. The code iterates through each key-value pair: ('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3), ('d', 2)
2. It creates new key-value pairs by swapping the key and value, resulting in: (1, 'a'), (2, 'b'), (3, 'c'), (2, 'd'). Notice that we have two entries with the key '2'.
3. Since dictionaries cannot have duplicate keys, the last one encountered for key '2', which is (2, 'd'), will remain in the final dictionary.

Therefore, the output will be a new dictionary with the keys and values swapped from the input dictionary.

{1: 'a', 2: 'd', 3: 'c'}
