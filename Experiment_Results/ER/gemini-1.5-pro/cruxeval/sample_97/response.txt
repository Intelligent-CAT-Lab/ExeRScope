<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes a list `lst` as input. Let's analyze its execution with the input `[2, 0]`:

1. **`lst.clear()`:** This line clears the contents of the input list `lst`. So, `lst` becomes `[]`.
2. **`for i in lst:`:** This loop iterates through each element `i` in `lst`. However, since `lst` is now empty, the loop won't run. 
3. **`else:`:**  The `else` block of a `for` loop executes if the loop completes normally (i.e., it doesn't encounter a `break` statement). In this case, the loop didn't run at all, but it still completed normally. 
4. **`return True`:**  As the `else` block executes, the function returns `True`.

<<<Output>>>
True
