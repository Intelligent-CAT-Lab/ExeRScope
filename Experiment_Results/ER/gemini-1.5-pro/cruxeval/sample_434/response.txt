<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes a single argument `string`. 

1. **Inside the `try` block:**
   - It attempts to call the `rfind('e')` method on the input `string`. This method is supposed to find the last occurrence of the character 'e' in the string. 
   - Since 'eeuseeeoehasa' is a string, the `rfind` method will be executed successfully.
   - The `rfind('e')` method finds the last occurrence of 'e' which is at index 11 (counting from 0).

2. **Return Value:**
   - The `rfind` method returns the index 11.

Therefore, the function `f` will return `11`.

<<<Output>>>
11
