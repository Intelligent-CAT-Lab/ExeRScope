<<<Analysis>>>
1. **Initialization:**
   - The function `f` takes two arguments: `text` and `new_ending`, which are assigned the values 'jro' and 'wdlp' respectively.
   - A new list called `result` is created by converting the input string `text` ('jro') into a list of its characters: `['j', 'r', 'o']`.

2. **Extension:**
   - The `extend()` method is used to append the characters from `new_ending` ('wdlp') to the `result` list. 
   - After the extension, the `result` list becomes: `['j', 'r', 'o', 'w', 'd', 'l', 'p']`.

3. **Joining:**
   - The `join('')` method concatenates all the characters in the `result` list using an empty string as a separator.
   - This effectively joins the characters back into a single string: 'jrowdlp'.

4. **Return:**
   - The function returns the concatenated string 'jrowdlp'.

<<<Output>>>
'jrowdlp'
