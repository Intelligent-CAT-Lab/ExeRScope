<<<Analysis>>>
1. The function `f` first checks if the input `ans` is a decimal string using `ans.isdecimal()`. In this case, `'0'` is a decimal string, so the condition is True.
2. Inside the `if` block:
    - `total` is initialized as `int(ans) * 4 - 50`, which is `int('0') * 4 - 50 = -50`.
    - Next, a list comprehension is used to count the number of digits in `ans` that are not in the string `'02468'`. Since `'0'` is in `'02468'`, the list comprehension will result in an empty list `[]`.
    - The length of this empty list is `0`, so `total` remains `-50`.
3. Finally, the function returns the value of `total`, which is `-50`.
<<<Output>>>
-50
