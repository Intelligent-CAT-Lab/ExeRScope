1. The function `f` takes a string `s` as input, which in this case is `'hi '`
2. Inside the function:
    -  A list comprehension `a` is created by iterating through each character (`char`) in the input string `s`. It includes all characters except spaces. So for `s = 'hi '`, `a` becomes `['h', 'i']`.
    -  A new variable `b` is created and assigned the same value as `a`. Therefore, `b` also becomes `['h', 'i']`.
    -  The code then iterates through the list `a` in reverse order using `reversed(a)`.
    -  Inside the loop:
        - It checks if the current character `c` is a space. If it is, it removes the last element of list `b` using `b.pop()`. 
        - If the current character `c` is not a space, it breaks out of the loop. Since the loop iterates in reverse and stops at the first non-space character, it effectively removes trailing spaces from `b` (which is a reference to `a`).
    -  Finally, the function returns the elements of the list `b` joined together as a string using `''.join(b)`.
Therefore, the function `f` takes a string as input, removes all spaces, and then removes any trailing spaces before returning the modified string.
When the input is `'hi '`, the function will first remove all spaces, resulting in `'hi'`. Then, it removes trailing spaces, which doesn't change anything. Therefore, the output of the function is `'hi'`.
