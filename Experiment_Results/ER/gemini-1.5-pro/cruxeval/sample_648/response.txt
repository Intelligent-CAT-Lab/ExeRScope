<<<Analysis>>>
1. We start with `list1` as `[0, 4, 5, 6]` and `list2` as `[13, 23, -5, 0]`.
2. `l = list1[:]` creates a copy of `list1`, so `l` is also `[0, 4, 5, 6]`.
3. We enter the `while len(l) > 0` loop since `l` has elements.
4. The last element of `l` is `6`. Since `6` is not in `list2`, we go to the `else` block.
5. The `else` block returns `l[-1]`, which is `6`.
6. Therefore, the function will return `6`.
