1. The function `f` takes a string `text` as input, in this case, "mrq7y".
2. Inside the function, a list `result_list` is initialized with elements ['3', '3', '3', '3'].
3. The code enters an `if` statement that checks if `result_list` is True. Since `result_list` is not empty, the condition evaluates to True.
4. Inside the `if` block, the `clear()` method is called on `result_list`, removing all elements from the list and making it empty.
5. Finally, the function returns the length of the input `text` using `len("mrq7y")`, which is 5.
