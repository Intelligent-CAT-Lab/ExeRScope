1. The function `f` takes two arguments: a list of characters `txt` and a character `alpha`.
2. Inside the function, `txt` is sorted in ascending order using `sorted(txt)`, so `txt` becomes `['2', '3', '4', '7', '8', '9']`.
3. It then finds the index of `alpha` which is '9' in the sorted `txt` using `txt.index(alpha)`. The index of '9' is 5. 
4. Next, it checks if the index obtained in step 3 is even or odd using the modulo operator (%). In this case, 5 % 2 = 1, which is not equal to 0.
5. Since the condition in the if statement `txt.index(alpha) % 2 == 0` is false, the code does not execute the line `return txt[::-1]`.
6. Instead, the code executes the next line `return txt`, which returns the sorted list `txt`.

Therefore, the output of executing the function `f` on the input `(['8', '9', '7', '4', '3', '2'], '9')` is `['2', '3', '4', '7', '8', '9']`.

['2', '3', '4', '7', '8', '9']
