<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes three arguments: a list of numbers called `numbers`, an element `elem`, and an index `idx`. 

1. **`numbers.insert(idx, elem)`:** This line inserts the given `elem` (which is 8 in this case) into the list `numbers` at the specified `idx` (which is 5 in this case).  Since Python uses zero-based indexing, inserting at index 5 means adding the element *after* the existing elements of the list. The list `numbers` is modified in-place.

2. **`return numbers`**: The function then returns the modified list `numbers`.

Therefore, after the function call `f([1, 2, 3], 8, 5)`, the list will be `[1, 2, 3, 8]` and this list will be returned.

<<<Output>>>
[1, 2, 3, 8]
