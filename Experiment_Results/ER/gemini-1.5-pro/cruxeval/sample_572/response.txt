<<<Analysis>>>
1. **Initialization:**
   - `data` is initialized with the dictionary `{1: 9, 2: 10, 3: 1}`.
   - `num` is initialized with the integer `1`.
   - An empty dictionary `new_dict` is created.
   - `temp` is created as a list of key-value pairs from the `data` dictionary: `[(1, 9), (2, 10), (3, 1)]`.
2. **Iteration:**
   - The `for` loop iterates backwards from `len(temp) - 1` (which is 2) down to `num` (which is 1), with a step of -1. 
   - In each iteration, the loop assigns `None` to the key obtained from the `temp` list at the current index `i` in the `new_dict` dictionary.  
     - When `i` is 2,  `(3, 1)` from `temp` is added as key to `new_dict`.
     - When `i` is 1,  `(2, 10)` from `temp` is added as key to `new_dict`.
3. **Concatenation and Return:**
   - After the loop, `temp[num:]` (which is `[(2, 10), (3, 1)]`) is concatenated with `list(new_dict.items())`, which converts the `new_dict` items into a list of key-value pairs: `[((3, 1), None), ((2, 10), None)]`.
   - The final concatenated list `[(2, 10), (3, 1), ((3, 1), None), ((2, 10), None)]` is returned.

<<<Output>>>
[(2, 10), (3, 1), ((3, 1), None), ((2, 10), None)]
