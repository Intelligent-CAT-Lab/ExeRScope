<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes a list `nums` and an integer `target` as input. It first uses the `.count()` method to count how many times `target` appears in `nums`.  Then it multiplies that count by 2 and returns the result. 

Let's execute the function step-by-step with the given input:

1. `nums` is [1, 1] and `target` is 1.
2. `nums.count(target)` counts how many times 1 appears in the list [1, 1]. The count is 2. 
3. The count, 2, is then multiplied by 2, resulting in 4.
4. The function returns the final result, 4. 

<<<Output>>>
