<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes a string `postcode` as input and aims to extract a substring starting from the first occurrence of the character 'C'.

1. `postcode.index('C')`: This part finds the index (position) of the first occurrence of 'C' within the input string 'ED20 CW'. In this case, 'C' is at index 5 (remember Python uses zero-based indexing).

2. `postcode[5:]`: This part slices the string `postcode`, starting from the index found in the previous step (5) and going to the end of the string. 

Therefore, the function will return the substring of 'ED20 CW' starting from the first 'C'.

<<<Output>>>
'CW'
