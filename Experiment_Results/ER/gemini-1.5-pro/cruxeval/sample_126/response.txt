<<<Analysis>>>
1. **text.rpartition('o')**: This line partitions the string 'kkxkxxfck' from the right at the last occurrence of 'o'. Since 'o' is not present in the string, it returns three values: '', '', 'kkxkxxfck'.  Let's call these s[0], s[1], and s[2] respectively.

2. **(s[0] == '' and '-' or s[0])**: This expression checks if s[0] is empty. If it is, it assigns '-' to 'div', otherwise it assigns the value of s[0] to 'div'. Since s[0] is '', 'div' will be '-'.

3. **(s[2] == '' and '-' or s[2])**: Similarly, this expression checks if s[2] is empty. If it is, it assigns '-' to 'div2'. Otherwise, it assigns the value of s[2] to 'div2'. Here, s[2] is 'kkxkxxfck', so 'div2' will be 'kkxkxxfck'.

4. **s[1] + div + s[1] + div2**: Finally, the code concatenates s[1], div, s[1] again, and div2. Since s[1] is '', 'div' is '-', and 'div2' is 'kkxkxxfck', the final result will be '--kkxkxxfck'.

<<<Output>>>
'--kkxkxxfck'
