<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes an array as input. 
1. It initializes an empty array called `array_2`.
2. It then iterates through each element `i` in the input `array`.
3. If `i` is greater than 0, it is appended to `array_2`.
4. After processing all elements in the input `array`, `array_2` is sorted in descending order using `sort(reverse=True)`.
5. Finally, the function returns the sorted `array_2`.

For the input `[4, 8, 17, 89, 43, 14]`, all elements are greater than 0, so `array_2` will contain all elements in the input array after the loop. After sorting in descending order, the function will return `[89, 43, 17, 14, 8, 4]`.

<<<Output>>>
[89, 43, 17, 14, 8, 4]
