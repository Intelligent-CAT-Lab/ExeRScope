<<<Analysis>>>
1. The function `f` takes three arguments: `test`, `sep`, and `maxsplit`. In this case, `test` is 'ab cd', `sep` is 'x', and `maxsplit` is 2.
2. Inside the function, the code first enters a `try` block.
3. Within the `try` block, it attempts to call the `rsplit` method on the `test` string with the given `sep` and `maxsplit` arguments.
4. Since `sep` is 'x' and the `test` string ('ab cd') does not contain 'x', `test.rsplit('x', 2)` would raise a ValueError.
5. As a ValueError occurs, the code enters the `except` block.
6. In the `except` block, it calls the `rsplit` method on the `test` string without any arguments. This defaults to splitting at any whitespace.
7. `test.rsplit()` would split 'ab cd' into ['ab', 'cd'].
8. Therefore, the function would return ['ab', 'cd'].

<<<Output>>>
['ab', 'cd']
