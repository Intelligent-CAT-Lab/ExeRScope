<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes a string as input and performs two operations on it:

1. **`string.title()`: ** This converts the first character of each word in the string to uppercase and the remaining characters to lowercase. Applying this to our input `'1oE-err bzz-bmm'` would give us `'1Oe-Err Bzz-Bmm'`. 

2. **`replace(' ', '')`: ** This replaces all occurrences of spaces (' ') in the string with an empty string (''), effectively removing all spaces.  Applying this to the result from the previous step would give us `'1Oe-ErrBzz-Bmm'`.

Therefore, the output of executing the function `f` on the input `'1oE-err bzz-bmm'` is `'1Oe-ErrBzz-Bmm'`.
