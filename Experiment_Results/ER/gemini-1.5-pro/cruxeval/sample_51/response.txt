<<<Analysis>>>
1. First, the variable `s` is assigned the string `'<<<<<<<<<<'` (10 less-than symbols). 
2. Then the function `f` is called with the argument `21`. 
3. Inside the function `f`, the input `num` (which is 21 in this case) is checked if it's divisible by 2.
4. Since 21 is not divisible by 2, the `else` block is executed, which returns `num - 1` (21 - 1 = 20).

<<<Output>>>
20
