<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes a string `text` as input and returns a string. Inside the function:

1. `text[-1]`: This part extracts the last character of the string. In this case, the last character of the string `'hellomyfriendear'` is `'r'`. 
2. `text[:-1]`: This part slices the string from the beginning up to, but not including, the last character. For the input `'hellomyfriendear'`, this would give us `'hellomyfriendea'`.
3. Finally, the function returns the concatenation of the two results above, effectively moving the last character to the beginning of the string.

Therefore, the output of executing the function `f` on the input `'hellomyfriendear'` is `'rhellomyfriendea'`.

'rhellomyfriendea'
