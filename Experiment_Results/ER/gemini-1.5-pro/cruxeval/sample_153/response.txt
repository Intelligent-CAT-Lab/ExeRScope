<<<Analysis>>>
1. **Function call:** `f('friends and love', 'and', 3)` is called with `text = 'friends and love'`, `suffix = 'and'`, and `num = 3`.

2. **Inside the function:**
   - `str_num = str(num)` converts the integer `num` (which is 3) to its string representation, `'3'`.
   -  The expression `suffix + str_num` concatenates the strings `'and'` and `'3'` resulting in the string `'and3'`.

3. **endswith method:** `text.endswith(suffix + str_num)` checks if the string `text` ends with the string `'and3'`. In this case, 'friends and love' does not end with 'and3'.

4. **Return value:** The `endswith` method returns `False` since the condition is not met.
