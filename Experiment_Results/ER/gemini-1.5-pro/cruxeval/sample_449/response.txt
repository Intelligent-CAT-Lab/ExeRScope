<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes a string `x` as input and checks if all characters in the string are digits. 

1. **Initialization:**
   - `n = len(x)`: The variable `n` is assigned the length of the input string `x`. In this case, `n = len('1') = 1`.
   - `i = 0`: A counter variable `i` is initialized to 0.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The `while` loop iterates as long as `i` is less than `n` and the character at index `i` in the string `x` is a digit.
     - **Iteration 1:**
       - `i < n` is True (0 < 1)
       - `x[i].isdigit()` is True because `x[0]` is '1', which is a digit.
       - `i` is incremented to 1.

3. **Loop Termination:**
   - The loop condition `i < n` becomes False (1 < 1) and the loop terminates.

4. **Return Value:**
   - The function returns `i == n`. Since `i` is 1 and `n` is 1, the condition `i == n` is True.

Therefore, the function will return `True`.
