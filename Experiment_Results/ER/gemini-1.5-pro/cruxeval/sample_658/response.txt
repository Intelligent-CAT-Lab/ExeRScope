<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes a dictionary `d` and a list `get_ary` as input. It iterates through each element `key` in the `get_ary` list. For each `key`, it retrieves the corresponding value from the dictionary `d` using `d.get(key)`. If the key exists in the dictionary, the value is appended to the `result` list. If the key is not found, `d.get(key)` returns `None`, which is also appended to the `result` list. Finally, the function returns the `result` list.

When calling `f({3: "swims like a bull"}, [3, 2, 'c', True, 5])`, the function iterates through the list `[3, 2, 'c', True, 5]` and performs the following lookups in the dictionary:

1. `key = 3`: `d.get(3)` returns "swims like a bull" because the key 3 exists in the dictionary.
2. `key = 2`: `d.get(2)` returns `None` because the key 2 does not exist in the dictionary.
3. `key = 'c'`: `d.get('c')` returns `None` because the key 'c' does not exist in the dictionary.
4. `key = True`: `d.get(True)` returns `None` because the key `True` does not exist in the dictionary.
5. `key = 5`: `d.get(5)` returns `None` because the key 5 does not exist in the dictionary.

Therefore, the `result` list will be `['swims like a bull', None, None, None, None]`.

['swims like a bull', None, None, None, None]
