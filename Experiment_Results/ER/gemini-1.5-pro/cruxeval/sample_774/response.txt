<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes two arguments, an integer `num` and a string `name`. It then defines a string variable `f_str` with the value  'quiz leader = {}, count = {}'.
The `format` method is called on this string, which substitutes the first occurrence of `{}` with the value of `name` and the second occurrence of `{}` with the value of `num`. The resulting string is then returned. So in this case, it will return 'quiz leader = Cornareti, count = 23'.
<<<Output>>>
'quiz leader = Cornareti, count = 23'
