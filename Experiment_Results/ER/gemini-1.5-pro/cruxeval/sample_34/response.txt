<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes a list `nums` and two integers `odd1` and `odd2` as input. It then proceeds to remove all occurrences of `odd1` and `odd2` from the list `nums`.

1. **Initialization:**
   - `nums = [1, 2, 3, 7, 7, 6, 8, 4, 1, 2, 3, 5, 1, 3, 21, 1, 3]`
   - `odd1 = 3`
   - `odd2 = 1`

2. **First While Loop (Removing `odd1`):**
   - The loop iterates as long as the value `3` (`odd1`) is present in the list `nums`.
   - In each iteration, one instance of `3` is removed from the list.
   - After this loop, the list `nums` becomes `[2, 7, 7, 6, 8, 4, 2, 5, 21, 2]`.

3. **Second While Loop (Removing `odd2`):**
   - This loop iterates as long as the value `1` (`odd2`) is present in the modified `nums` list. 
   - Since there are no `1`s left in the list, this loop doesn't execute.

4. **Return:**
   - Finally, the function returns the modified list `nums`.

Therefore, the output of the function `f` with the given input is `[2, 7, 7, 6, 8, 4, 2, 5, 21, 2]`.

<<<Output>>>
[2, 7, 7, 6, 8, 4, 2, 5, 21, 2]
