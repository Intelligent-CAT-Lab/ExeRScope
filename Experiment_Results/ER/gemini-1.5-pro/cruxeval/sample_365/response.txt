<<<Analysis>>>
1. The function `f` checks if the string `s` starts with the string `n`. In this case, `s` is 'mRcwVqXsRDRb' and `n` is 'xqc', so the condition is False.
2. As the condition is False, the function goes to the next line and directly returns the string `s` which is 'mRcwVqXsRDRb'.

<<<Output>>>
'mRcwVqXsRDRb'
