<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes a dictionary `dic` as input and sorts its items based on the keys in ascending order.

1. `dic.items()`: This returns a view object that displays a list of (key, value) pairs from the dictionary `dic`. In this case, it would be `[('b', 1), ('a', 2)]`.

2. `sorted(..., key=lambda x: x[0])`: This sorts the list of (key, value) pairs. 
    - `sorted()` is a built-in Python function used to sort iterables.
    - The `key` argument lets you specify a function to extract the values to be sorted by.
    - `lambda x: x[0]` is a lambda function that takes a tuple (key, value) as input and returns the key (x[0]).
    - Therefore, the `sorted` function will sort the (key, value) pairs based on the keys in ascending order.

3. The sorted list of tuples is returned by the function.

In this case, the dictionary is `{'b': 1, 'a': 2}`. The keys are 'b' and 'a'. Sorting them in ascending order gives us ['a', 'b']. So the function would return a list of tuples: `[('a', 2), ('b', 1)]`.

<<<Output>>>
[('a', 2), ('b', 1)]
