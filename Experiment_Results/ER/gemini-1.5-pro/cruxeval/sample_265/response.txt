<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes a dictionary `d` and an integer `k` as input. It creates a new dictionary `new_d`. It then iterates through each key-value pair in the input dictionary `d`. For each key-value pair, it checks if the key is less than `k`. If it is, the key-value pair is added to the `new_d` dictionary. Finally, the function returns the `new_d` dictionary. 

When calling `f({1: 2, 2: 4, 3: 3}, 3)`, the function will iterate through the dictionary `{1: 2, 2: 4, 3: 3}`. The keys 1 and 2 are less than 3, so the key-value pairs (1: 2) and (2: 4) will be added to the `new_d` dictionary. The key 3 is not less than 3, so the key-value pair (3: 3) will not be added to the `new_d` dictionary. 

Therefore, the function will return the dictionary `{1: 2, 2: 4}`. 
<<<Output>>>
{1: 2, 2: 4}
