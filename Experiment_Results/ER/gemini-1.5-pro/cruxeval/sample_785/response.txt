<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes an integer `n` as input and converts it to a string. Then, it iterates over each character `c` in the string. For each character, it left justifies it using spaces. The width of this justification is `int(c) * 2`. Finally, it concatenates all these justified characters together.

For the input `n = 1`, the string becomes "1". There's only one character which is '1'. So, the loop runs only once. Inside the loop:

1. `c` will be '1'.
2. `int(c) * 2` will be `1 * 2 = 2`.
3. `c.ljust(int(c) * 2)` will left justify the character '1' with a width of 2, resulting in "1 ".

The loop ends and the function returns the final string "1 ".
<<<Output>>>
'1 '
