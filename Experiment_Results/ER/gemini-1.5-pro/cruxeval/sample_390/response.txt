<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` first checks if the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespaces is empty. 
1. `text.strip()` removes leading and trailing whitespaces from the input " \t ", resulting in an empty string "".
2. `not text.strip()` checks if the stripped string is empty. Since it's empty, this condition evaluates to `True`.
3. As the condition is `True`, the function enters the `if` block and returns the length of the stripped string, which is `len("")` which equals to 0.
Therefore, the output of executing the function `f` on the input " \t " is 0.
