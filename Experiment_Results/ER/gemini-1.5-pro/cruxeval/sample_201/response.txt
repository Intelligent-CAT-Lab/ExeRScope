The function `f` takes a string `text` as input and aims to extract all the digits from it and return them in reverse order. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initialization:** An empty list called `chars` is created. This list will store the extracted digits.

2. **Iteration:** The code iterates through each character `c` in the input string `'--4yrw 251-//4 6p'`.

3. **Digit Check:** For each character `c`, the code checks if it is a digit using `isdigit()`. 
   - If `c` is a digit, it's appended to the `chars` list.

4. **Concatenation and Reversal:** After processing all characters, the `chars` list contains all the digits from the input string. 
   - `chars[::-1]` reverses the order of elements in the `chars` list.
   - `''.join(...)` joins the elements of the reversed `chars` list into a single string.

5. **Return:** The function returns the string containing the extracted digits in reverse order.

Therefore, for the input `'--4yrw 251-//4 6p'`, the function will extract the digits '4', '2', '5', '1', '4', and '6', and return them in reversed order as '641524'.

<<<Output>>>
'641524'
