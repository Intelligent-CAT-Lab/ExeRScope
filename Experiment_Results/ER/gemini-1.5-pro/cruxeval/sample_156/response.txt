<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes three arguments: `text`, `limit`, and `char`. 

1. **Condition Check:** It first checks if the `limit` (which is 5) is less than the length of the `text` (which is 'tqzym' and has a length of 5). Since 5 is not less than 5, the condition is false.

2. **`else` block execution:**  Because the condition is false, the code in the `else` block is executed: `return text.ljust(limit, char)`. This line does the following:
   -  `text.ljust(limit, char)`: This part uses the `ljust` method to pad the `text` string on the right side. 
      - `limit` (5) specifies the total desired length of the output string.
      - `char` ('c') is the character used for padding.

   - Since the `text` is already 5 characters long, and `limit` is also 5, no padding is added. The function returns the original `text`. 

Therefore, the output of executing the function `f` on the input `('tqzym', 5, 'c')` is 'tqzym'.

'tqzym'
