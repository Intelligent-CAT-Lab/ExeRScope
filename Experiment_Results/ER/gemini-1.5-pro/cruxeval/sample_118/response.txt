The function `f` takes two string arguments: `text` and `chars`. It aims to remove occurrences of `chars` concatenated with itself multiple times from the `text`. Let's break down its execution with the given input:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `num_applies = 2`: This variable determines how many times `chars` is concatenated with itself.
   - `extra_chars = ''`:  An empty string is initialized, which will store the concatenated `chars` string.

2. **First Iteration of the Loop (i = 0):**
   - `extra_chars += chars`: `extra_chars` becomes 'mk'.
   - `text = text.replace(extra_chars, '')`: All occurrences of 'mk' in the `text` ('zbzquiuqnmfkx') are removed. `text` becomes 'zbzquiuqnf x'.

3. **Second Iteration of the Loop (i = 1):**
   - `extra_chars += chars`: `extra_chars` becomes 'mkmk'.
   - `text = text.replace(extra_chars, '')`: The code looks for 'mkmk' in the updated `text` ('zbzquiuqnf x'). Since there are no occurrences of 'mkmk', `text` remains unchanged.

4. **Return:** The function returns the modified `text`: 'zbzquiuqnf x'.

<<<Output>>>
'zbzquiuqnf x'
