<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes a list of lists called `ls` and a number `n` as input. It iterates through each sublist `i` in `ls`. For each sublist, it checks if the element at index 0 (`i[0]`) is equal to `n`. If it is, it updates the value of the variable `answer` to the current sublist `i`. Finally, it returns the value of `answer`.

1. **Initialization:**
   - `ls` is initialized to `[[1, 9, 4], [83, 0, 5], [9, 6, 100]]`.
   - `n` is initialized to `1`.
   - `answer` is initialized to `0`.

2. **Iteration 1:**
   - `i` takes the value of the first sublist `[1, 9, 4]`.
   - Since `i[0]` (1) is equal to `n` (1), `answer` is updated to `[1, 9, 4]`.

3. **Iteration 2:**
   - `i` takes the value of the second sublist `[83, 0, 5]`.
   - Since `i[0]` (83) is not equal to `n` (1), `answer` remains `[1, 9, 4]`.

4. **Iteration 3:**
   - `i` takes the value of the third sublist `[9, 6, 100]`.
   - Since `i[0]` (9) is not equal to `n` (1), `answer` remains `[1, 9, 4]`.

5. **Return:**
   - The loop finishes, and the function returns the value of `answer`, which is `[1, 9, 4]`.

Therefore, the output of executing the function `f` on the input `([[1, 9, 4], [83, 0, 5], [9, 6, 100]], 1)` is `[1, 9, 4]`.

[1, 9, 4]
