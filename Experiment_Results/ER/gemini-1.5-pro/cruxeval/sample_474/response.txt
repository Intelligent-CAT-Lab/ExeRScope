<<<Analysis>>>
1. **Initialization:**
   - `a = []`: An empty list `a` is created to store the centered lines.
   - `lines = txt.split('\n')`: The input string `txt` is split at each newline character (`\n`), resulting in a list of lines: `['#[)[]>[^e>', ' 8']`.
   - The `marker` value is -5.

2. **Iterating through Lines:**
   - The code enters a `for` loop that iterates through each `line` in the `lines` list.

     - **Iteration 1: `line = '#[)[]>[^e>'`**
       - `a.append(line.center(marker))`: The `center()` method is called on the current `line` with the argument `marker` which is -5. However, the `center()` method requires a positive width. Since a negative width is provided, it defaults to 0. Therefore, the line remains unchanged and is appended to the list `a`.  
       - Now, `a` becomes: `['#[)[]>[^e>']`.

     - **Iteration 2: `line = ' 8'`**
       -  Similar to the previous iteration, `center()` is called on the line ' 8' with `marker` as -5. Again, since `marker` is negative, the `center` method effectively does nothing. ' 8' is appended to the list `a`.
       - Now, `a` becomes: `['#[)[]>[^e>', ' 8']`.

3. **Joining the Lines:**
   - `'\n'.join(a)`: The elements of the list `a`, which now contain the centered lines, are joined back together with newline characters (`\n`) inserted between them.

4. **Return Value:**
   - The function returns the final string `'#[)[]>[^e>\n 8'`.

<<<Output>>>
#[)[]>[^e>
