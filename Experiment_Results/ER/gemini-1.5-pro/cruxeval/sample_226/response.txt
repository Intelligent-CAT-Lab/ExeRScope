<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes a list of numbers `nums` as input and modifies it by appending each number divisible by 3 to the end of the list. Let's analyze step by step how it processes the input `[1, 3]`:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `nums` is initialized with the input list `[1, 3]`.

2. **Iteration 1 (i = 0):**
   - `nums[0]` is 1.
   - Since 1 is not divisible by 3, the condition `nums[i] % 3 == 0` is False, and nothing is appended to the list. 
   - `nums` remains `[1, 3]`.

3. **Iteration 2 (i = 1):**
   - `nums[1]` is 3.
   - Since 3 is divisible by 3, the condition `nums[i] % 3 == 0` is True.
   - Therefore, `nums[i]` which is 3 is appended to the end of `nums`.
   - `nums` becomes `[1, 3, 3]`.

4. **Loop Termination:**
   - The loop finishes because `i` has reached the end of the range (0, 1).

5. **Return:**
   - The function returns the modified list `nums`, which is now `[1, 3, 3]`.

<<<Output>>>
[1, 3, 3]
