1. The function `f` takes two arguments: `text` and `char`. In this case, `text` is 'llomnrpc' and `char` is 'x'.
2. `char_index = text.find(char)`: This line finds the index of the first occurrence of `char` in `text`. Since 'x' is not present in 'llomnrpc', `char_index` will be -1.
3. `result = []`: An empty list called `result` is created.
4. `if char_index > 0:`: This condition checks if `char_index` is greater than 0. Since `char_index` is -1, this condition is not met, and the code inside the `if` block is skipped.
5. `result.extend(list(char)+list(text[char_index+len(char):]))`: This line extends the `result` list. Let's break it down:
    - `list(char)`: Converts the `char` ('x') into a list containing one element, ['x'].
    - `char_index + len(char)`: -1 + 1 = 0.
    - `text[char_index+len(char):]`: This slice takes the whole string `text` because the starting index is 0.
    - Finally, `list('x')` and `list('llomnrpc')` are concatenated and extended into the `result` list.
6. `return ''.join(result)`: This line joins the elements of the `result` list into a single string and returns it.

Therefore, the output of the function will be 'xllomnrpc'.

'xllomnrpc'
