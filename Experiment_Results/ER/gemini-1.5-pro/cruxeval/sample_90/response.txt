<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes a list (`array`) as input and aims to return a new list where each element is a copy of the corresponding element in the input list. Let's break down how it processes the input `[[1, 2, 3], [], [1, 2, 3]]`:

1. **Initialization:** An empty list called `return_arr` is created. This will store the copies of the sublists.

2. **Iteration:** The code then iterates through each sublist (`a`) in the input list:
   - **First Iteration:** `a` is `[1, 2, 3]`. The `copy()` method creates a shallow copy of this sublist, and this copy is appended to `return_arr`. 
   - **Second Iteration:** `a` is `[]`.  A copy of this empty list is appended to `return_arr`.
   - **Third Iteration:**  `a` is `[1, 2, 3]`. Again, a copy is created and appended to `return_arr`.

3. **Return:** After processing all sublists, the function returns `return_arr`, which now contains copies of the original sublists.

<<<Output>>>
[[1, 2, 3], [], [1, 2, 3]]
