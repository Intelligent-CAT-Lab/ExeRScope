<<<Analysis>>>
1. The function `f` takes a string `text` as input.
2. Inside the function, `filter(str.isnumeric, text)` is used to filter out the numeric characters from the input string `text`. `str.isnumeric` checks if each character in the string is a numeric character or not.
3. `list(filter(str.isnumeric, text))` converts the filtered result into a list, which is then assigned to the variable `nums`.
4. `assert len(nums) > 0` checks if the length of the list `nums` is greater than 0. If it is, the code proceeds. If not, it raises an AssertionError.
5. Finally, `''.join(nums)` joins the elements of the list `nums` (which are numeric characters) into a string and returns the resulting string.

Therefore, for the input `'-123   \t+314'`, the function would first extract the numeric characters `'1', '2', '3', '3', '1', '4'`. Then it would concatenate them into a string resulting in `'123314'`.
<<<Output>>>
'123314'
