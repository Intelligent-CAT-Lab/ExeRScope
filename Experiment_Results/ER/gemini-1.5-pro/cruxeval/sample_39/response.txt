<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes an array and an element as input. It checks if the element is present in the array. If the element is present in the array, the function returns the index of the element in the array. Otherwise, it returns -1. 

In this case, the function `f` is called with the array `[6, 2, 7, 1]` and the element `6`. As 6 is present in the array at index 0, the function will return 0.
