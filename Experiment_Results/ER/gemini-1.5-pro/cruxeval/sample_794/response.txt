<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` aims to extract alphanumeric characters from a string. Let's break down its execution step by step with the input "\"\\%$ normal chars $%~ qwet42'":

1. **Initialization:** 
   - `a = []`: An empty list named 'a' is created to store the extracted alphanumeric characters. 

2. **Iteration:**
   - The code iterates through each character in the input string: "\"\\%$ normal chars $%~ qwet42'".
   - For each character 'c':
     - `if c.isalnum()`: It checks if the character is alphanumeric (letter or number). 
       - If true:  `a.append(c)` adds the character to the list 'a'.
       - If false: The character is ignored (like spaces and special characters).

3. **Concatenation:**
   - After processing all characters, `''.join(a)` joins the elements of the list 'a' into a single string without any separators. 

Therefore, the function will go through each character of "\"\\%$ normal chars $%~ qwet42'", add alphanumeric characters to the list 'a', and finally, join them together.

<<<Output>>>
'normalcharsqwet42'
