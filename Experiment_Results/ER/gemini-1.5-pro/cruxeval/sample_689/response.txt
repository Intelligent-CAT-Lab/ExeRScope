1. The function `f` takes a list `arr` as input.
2. `count` is assigned the length of the input list `arr`, which is 4 in this case.
3. `sub` is created as a copy of the input list `arr`, so `sub` is initially `[-3, -6, 2, 7]`.
4. The `for` loop iterates over the indices of `sub` with a step of 2, meaning it will process indices 0 and 2. 
5. Inside the loop:
    - For `i = 0`: `sub[0]` (`-3`) is multiplied by 5, resulting in `-15`. So, `sub` becomes `[-15, -6, 2, 7]`.
    - For `i = 2`: `sub[2]` (`2`) is multiplied by 5, resulting in `10`. So, `sub` becomes `[-15, -6, 10, 7]`.
6. The loop ends, and the function returns the modified `sub` list.

Therefore, the output of executing the function `f` on the input `[-3, -6, 2, 7]` is `[-15, -6, 10, 7]`.

[-15, -6, 10, 7]
