<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes two dictionaries `a` and `b` as input. It then uses the `**` operator to unpack the key-value pairs from both dictionaries. The expression `{**a, **b}` creates a new dictionary by combining the key-value pairs from `a` and `b`. If there are duplicate keys, the value from the dictionary mentioned later (`b` in this case) takes precedence.

In this specific case:
1. `a` is {'w': 5, 'wi': 10}
2. `b` is {'w': 3}
3. When merging, 'w' appears in both dictionaries. The value from `b` (which is 3) will be used for the key 'w' in the resulting dictionary.

Therefore, the output of executing the function `f` with the given input will be a dictionary containing the following key-value pairs: {'w': 3, 'wi': 10}.

<<<Output>>>
{'w': 3, 'wi': 10}
