1. The function `f` takes a list `array` as input. In this case, the input is `[3, -2, 0]`.
2. `array.reverse()`: This line reverses the input list in-place. So, `array` becomes `[0, -2, 3]`.
3. `array.clear()`: This line removes all elements from the list `array`, making it an empty list: `[]`.
4. `array.extend('x'*len(array))`: 
   - `len(array)` is now 0 because the list is empty.
   - `'x' * 0` results in an empty string `''`.
   - `array.extend('')` does not add anything to the list because it's extending with an empty string. Therefore, `array` remains `[]`.
5. `array.reverse()`: Reversing an empty list doesn't change anything. `array` is still `[]`.
6. Finally, the function returns the modified `array`.
