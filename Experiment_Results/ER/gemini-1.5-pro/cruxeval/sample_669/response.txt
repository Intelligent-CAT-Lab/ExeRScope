1. **t.rpartition('-')**: The code starts by using the `rpartition` method to search for the last occurrence of `'-'` in the input string `"fubarbaz"`. Since '-' doesn't exist in "fubarbaz", it will return three values: the original string before the separator (which is an empty string in this case), the separator itself (also an empty string), and the part after the separator (which is "fubarbaz"). 
2. **a, sep, b = ...**: The three values returned by `rpartition('-')` are then assigned to variables `a`, `sep`, and `b`, respectively. So, `a=''`, `sep=''`, and `b='fubarbaz'`.
3. **if len(b) == len(a)**: This condition checks if the length of `b` ("fubarbaz") is equal to the length of `a` (which is an empty string and has a length of 0). This condition evaluates to False.
4. **return a + b.replace(sep, '')**: Since the condition is False, the code executes this line, which concatenates `a` (an empty string) with the result of replacing all occurrences of `sep` (an empty string) in `b` ("fubarbaz") with an empty string. Replacing an empty string with an empty string doesn't change the string, so `b.replace(sep, '')` remains "fubarbaz". Therefore, the final output is "fubarbaz".
