<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes two string arguments: `text` and `suffix`. It first checks if both `text` and `suffix` are non-empty strings using the `if suffix and text` condition. 

1. **Input:** `text = 'spider'`, `suffix = 'ed'`
2. **Condition Check:** Both `'spider'` and `'ed'` are non-empty strings, so the condition evaluates to `True`.
3. **endswith() Check:** It then checks if the `text` ends with the `suffix` using `text.endswith(suffix)`, which is `True` in this case ('spider' does end with 'ed').
4. **removesuffix():** Since both conditions are True, the code executes `text.removesuffix(suffix)`, which removes the `suffix` ('ed') from the `text` ('spider'). 
5. **Return Value:** The function returns the modified `text`, which is now `'spid'`.

<<<Output>>>
'spid'
