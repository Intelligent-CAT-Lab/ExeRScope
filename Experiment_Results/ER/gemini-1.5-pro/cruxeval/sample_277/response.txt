<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes a list `lst` and a boolean `mode` as input. 

1. **Initialization:** It first creates a new list `result` by iterating through each element `el` in the input list `lst` and appending it to `result`. At this point, `result` is a copy of `lst`: `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.

2. **Conditional Reversal:** Next, it checks the value of `mode`. Since `mode` is `1` (which evaluates to `True` in Python), the code enters the `if` block. Inside the `if` block, the `reverse()` method is called on `result`, reversing its elements in place.

3. **Return:** Finally, the function returns the modified `result` list.

Therefore, after processing the input `([1, 2, 3, 4], 1)`, the function `f` will return a reversed copy of the input list.

[4, 3, 2, 1]
