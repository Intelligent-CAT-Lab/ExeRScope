<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes a list `lst` as input and performs the following operations:

1. **lst.reverse()**: This line reverses the order of elements in the list. So, `[7, 8, 2, 8]` becomes `[8, 2, 8, 7]`.
2. **lst.pop()**: This line removes and returns the last element of the list. In this case, `7` is removed, and the list becomes `[8, 2, 8]`.
3. **lst.reverse()**: The list is reversed again. Now, `[8, 2, 8]` becomes `[8, 2, 8]`.
4. **return lst**: Finally, the modified list `[8, 2, 8]` is returned.

Therefore, the output of executing the function `f` on the input `[7, 8, 2, 8]` is `[8, 2, 8]`.

[8, 2, 8]
