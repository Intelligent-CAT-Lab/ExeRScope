<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` aims to extract elements from a sequence based on their position after each sorting step. Here's a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `items = list(items)`: The input tuple `(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8)` is converted into a list: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]`.
   - `odd_positioned = []`: An empty list `odd_positioned` is created to store the result.

2. **Iterative Extraction:**
   - The `while len(items) > 0:` loop continues as long as the `items` list is not empty.
   - Inside the loop:
     - `position = items.index(min(items))`: The index of the minimum element in the current `items` list is found. In the first iteration, this would be `0` (index of element `1`).
     - `items.pop(position)`: The element at the `position` is removed. In the first iteration, `1` is removed, resulting in `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]`.
     - `item = items.pop(position)`: The element at the same `position` (which has now shifted due to the previous `pop`) is removed and assigned to `item`. In the first iteration, `2` is removed (it was at index `0` after the first `pop`), resulting in `[3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]`, and `item` is assigned the value `2`.
     - `odd_positioned.append(item)`: The `item` is appended to the `odd_positioned` list. In the first iteration, `2` is appended, making `odd_positioned` equal to `[2]`.

3. **Continuing Iterations:**
   - This process repeats. In the second iteration, the minimum element in `[3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]` is `3` (at index `0`). After removing `3` and then `4`, `4` is appended to `odd_positioned`, making it `[2, 4]`.
   - The loop continues until `items` becomes empty, extracting and appending elements to `odd_positioned`.

4. **Return Value:**
   - Finally, the function returns the `odd_positioned` list.

Following these steps, the function processes the input tuple and returns a list containing elements that occupied odd positions after each sorting step.

[2, 4, 6, 8]
