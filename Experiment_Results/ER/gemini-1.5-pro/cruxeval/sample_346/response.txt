<<<Analysis>>>
1. The function `f` takes a filename as input ('docs.doc' in this case).
2. Inside the function:
    - `suffix = filename.split('.')[-1]` splits the filename by '.' and takes the last element ('doc'), which is the file extension, and assigns it to the variable `suffix`.
    - `f2 = filename + suffix[::-1]` concatenates the filename with the reversed suffix ('cod'). So, `f2` becomes 'docs.doccod'.
    - `return f2.endswith(suffix)` checks if the modified filename (`f2`) ends with the original suffix ('doc'). Since 'docs.doccod' does end with 'doc', the function will return `True`.
<<<Output>>>
