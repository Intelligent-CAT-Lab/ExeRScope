<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes a list of names as input. 
1. It first initializes two variables: `count` with the length of the input list and `numberOfNames` to 0.
2. Then it iterates through each name in the input list.
3. For each name, it checks if all characters in the name are alphabetic using `isalpha()`. If they are, it increments `numberOfNames` by 1.
4. Finally, the function returns the value of `numberOfNames`, which represents the number of names in the input list that consist only of alphabetic characters.

For the input `['sharron', 'Savannah', 'Mike Cherokee']`, the function will count "sharron" and "Savannah" as they only contain alphabetic characters. "Mike Cherokee" will not be counted as it contains a space. 

Therefore, the output will be 2.
