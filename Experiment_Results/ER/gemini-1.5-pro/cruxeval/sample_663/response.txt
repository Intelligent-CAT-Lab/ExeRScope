<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` aims to remove the element `cron` from the input `container` if it exists. Let's break down how it processes the given input:

1. **Input:** 
   - `container` is an empty list `[]`
   - `cron` is the integer `2`

2. **Condition Check (`if not cron in container`):** This checks if `cron` (which is `2`) is present in `container` (the empty list). Since the list is empty, `2` is not present, and this condition evaluates to `True`.

3. **Return `container`:** As the condition is `True`, the code directly returns the original `container` without any modifications.

Therefore, since `container` is an empty list and the condition is met, the function will return an empty list.
