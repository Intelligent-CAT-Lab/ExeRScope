<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes three inputs: an array named `array`, an integer `x`, and another integer `i`. Let's break down how the code processes the input:

1. **Input Check:** It first checks if the index 'i' is within the valid range of the array's indices. If 'i' is less than the negative length of the array or greater than or equal to the length of the array, it means the index is out of bounds. In this case, it would return the string 'no'.
   - In our case, i = 4, and the length of the array is 10. The valid indices for this array are from -10 to 9. Since 4 falls within this range, the code proceeds to the next step. 

2. **Store Element at Index i:** The code then stores the value at the ith index of the array in a temporary variable `temp`.
   -  Here, the value at index 4 (5th element) is 5. So, `temp` will hold the value 5.

3. **Replacement:**  It replaces the element at the ith index of the array with the value of `x`.
   -  The value of `x` is 11. So, the element at index 4 (which was previously 5) will be replaced by 11.

4. **Return Modified Array:** Finally, the function returns the modified array.
   - The array after modification would be [1, 2, 3, 4, 11, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

<<<Output>>>
[1, 2, 3, 4, 11, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
