1. **Initialization:**
   -  The function `f` is called with `n = 12`.
   -  Inside the function, a dictionary `values` is defined with keys 0, 1, and 2, and corresponding values 3, 4.5, and '-'.
   -  An empty dictionary `res` is created to store the results.

2. **Iterating through `values`:**
   - The code iterates through each key-value pair (`i`, `j`) in the `values` dictionary.
     - **Iteration 1:** `i = 0`, `j = 3`
        - The condition `i % n != 2` (0 % 12 != 2) evaluates to `True`.
        - Therefore, `res[j] = n // 2` becomes `res[3] = 12 // 2`, resulting in `res = {3: 6}`.
     - **Iteration 2:** `i = 1`, `j = 4.5`
        - The condition `i % n != 2` (1 % 12 != 2) evaluates to `True`.
        -  Therefore, `res[j] = n // 2` becomes `res[4.5] = 12 // 2`, resulting in `res = {3: 6, 4.5: 6}`.
     - **Iteration 3:** `i = 2`, `j = '-'`
        - The condition `i % n != 2` (2 % 12 != 2) evaluates to `False`.
        - Therefore, the code within the `if` statement is not executed. `res` remains `{3: 6, 4.5: 6}`.

3. **Sorting and Returning:**
   - The `sorted(res)` function sorts the keys of the `res` dictionary in ascending order.
   - The sorted list of keys `[3, 4.5]` is returned.

[3, 4.5]
