<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` aims to remove negative numbers from an input array. It iterates through the array, and if a number is negative, it removes it using `array.pop(i)`.  However, modifying an array while iterating over it can lead to unexpected behavior. In this specific case, since the input array is empty, the loop won't run, and the function will return the original empty array.

Here's how it works step-by-step for the given input `[]`:

1. **Input:** `array = []`
2. **`len(array)` is 0**, so the `for` loop doesn't iterate even once.
3. **The function returns the original `array`, which is** `[]`.

<<<Output>>>
[]
