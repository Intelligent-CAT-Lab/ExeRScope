<<<Analysis>>>
1. The function `f` takes two arguments: `total` (which is expected to be a list) and `arg`.
2. Inside the function, it first checks if the type of `arg` is a list using `if type(arg) is list:`. In this case, `arg` is 'nammo', which is a string, not a list. So, the code will go to the `else` block.
3. In the `else` block, `total.extend(arg)` is executed. `extend` method adds each element of the given iterable (here, string 'nammo') to the end of the list `total`. 
4. Since `total` is initially `[1, 2, 3]`, after extending it with 'nammo', the final list would become `[1, 2, 3, 'n', 'a', 'm', 'm', 'o']`.
5. Finally, the function returns the modified `total` list.

<<<Output>>>
[1, 2, 3, 'n', 'a', 'm', 'm', 'o']
