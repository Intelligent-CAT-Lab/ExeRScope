<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes a string `text` as input and aims to remove all occurrences of the character '+' from it. 

1. **Initialization**: `new_text = list(text)` converts the input string `'hbtofdeiequ'` into a list of characters: `['h', 'b', 't', 'o', 'f', 'd', 'e', 'i', 'e', 'q', 'u']`.

2. **Loop Iteration**: The code then iterates through the string '+'.
   - For each character `i` in the string '+', it checks if `i` is present in the `new_text` list. 
   - In this specific case, since '+' is not present in the list `new_text`, the `remove(i)` operation is never executed.

3. **Joining the List**: After the loop completes, `''.join(new_text)` joins the characters in the `new_text` list back into a string. 

Since no changes were made to the `new_text` list, the function will return the original input string.

<<<Output>>>
'hbtofdeiequ'
