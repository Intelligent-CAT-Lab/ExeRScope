<<<Analysis>>>
1. The function `f` takes two arguments: `text` and `char`.
2. `text.count(char)` counts the number of times `char` appears in `text`. In this case, 'a' appears 4 times in 'abababac'.
3. `4 % 2` calculates the remainder when 4 is divided by 2, which is 0.
4. `0 != 0` checks if 0 is not equal to 0, which is False. 
5. Therefore, the function will return False.

<<<Output>>>
False
