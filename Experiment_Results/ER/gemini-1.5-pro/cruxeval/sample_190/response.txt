<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes a string `text` as input and returns a new string `short` containing only the lowercase letters from the input string.

1. **Initialization**: An empty string `short` is initialized. 
2. **Iteration**: The code iterates through each character `c` in the input string `'980jio80jic kld094398IIl '`.
3. **Conditional Check**: For each character `c`, it checks if it's a lowercase letter using `islower()`.
4. **Concatenation**: If the character is lowercase, it's appended to the `short` string. 
5. **Return**: Finally, after iterating through all characters, the `short` string containing only the lowercase letters is returned. 

Therefore, for the input `'980jio80jic kld094398IIl '`, the function will extract all the lowercase letters and return them as a single string.

<<<Output>>>
'jiojickldl'
