<<<Analysis>>>
1. `''.join(['A'] * 20)` creates a string of 20 'A's.
2. The function `f(text)` initializes a counter `n` to 0.
3. It then iterates over each character in the input string. 
4. For each character, it checks if it's uppercase using `char.isupper()`.
5. If a character is uppercase, the counter `n` is incremented by 1.
6. Since the input string has 20 'A's, which are all uppercase, the counter `n` will be incremented 20 times.
7. Finally, the function returns the value of `n`, which is 20.

<<<Output>>>
20
