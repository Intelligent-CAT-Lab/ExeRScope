The function `f` iterates through the input list `seq` and checks if each element ends with the given value `v`. If it does, it appends twice the element to a new list `a`. 

Let's break down the execution step-by-step:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `seq` is assigned the list `['oH', 'ee', 'mb', 'deft', 'n', 'zz', 'f', 'abA']`.
   - `v` is assigned the string `'zz'`.
   - An empty list `a` is created.

2. **Iteration 1**:
   - `i` takes the value `'oH'`.
   - `'oH'` does not end with `'zz'`, so nothing is appended to `a`.

3. **Iteration 2**:
   - `i` takes the value `'ee'`.
   - `'ee'` does not end with `'zz'`, so nothing is appended to `a`.

4. **Iteration 3**:
   - `i` takes the value `'mb'`.
   - `'mb'` does not end with `'zz'`, so nothing is appended to `a`.

5. **Iteration 4**:
   - `i` takes the value `'deft'`.
   - `'deft'` does not end with `'zz'`, so nothing is appended to `a`.

6. **Iteration 5**:
   - `i` takes the value `'n'`.
   - `'n'` does not end with `'zz'`, so nothing is appended to `a`.

7. **Iteration 6**:
   - `i` takes the value `'zz'`.
   - `'zz'` ends with `'zz'`, so `'zz'` * 2 = `'zzzz'` is appended to `a`.

8. **Iteration 7**:
   - `i` takes the value `'f'`.
   - `'f'` does not end with `'zz'`, so nothing is appended to `a`.

9. **Iteration 8**:
   - `i` takes the value `'abA'`.
   - `'abA'` does not end with `'zz'`, so nothing is appended to `a`.

10. **Return**: The function returns the list `a`, which now contains `['zzzz']`.

Therefore, the output of the function `f` with the given input is `['zzzz']`.
