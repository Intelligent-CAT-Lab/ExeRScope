1. **rsplit(None, 2):** This splits the string 'hypernimovichyp' from the right at most 2 times using space as a delimiter (None defaults to space). This results in the list: ['hypernim', 'ovi', 'chyp'].
2. **[l[:2] for l in ls]:** This list comprehension iterates through the list we got in step 1. For each string 'l' in the list, it takes the first 2 characters. So, 'hypernim' becomes 'hy', 'ovi' remains 'ov', and 'chyp' becomes 'ch'. This results in the list: ['hy', 'ov', 'ch'].
3. **'_'.join(['hy', 'ov', 'ch']):** This joins the elements of the list obtained in step 2 with an underscore '_'. This results in the final string: 'hy_ov_ch'. 
Therefore, the output of executing the function f with the given input is 'hy_ov_ch'.
<<<Output>>>
'hy_ov_ch'
