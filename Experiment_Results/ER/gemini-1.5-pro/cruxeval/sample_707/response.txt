<<<Analysis>>>
1. The function `f` takes two arguments: `text` which is a string and `position` which is an integer. In this case, `text` is "undbs l" and `position` is 1.
2. We calculate the `length` of the text: `len("undbs l")` which is 8.
3. We calculate the `index` using the modulo operator: `1 % (8 + 1)` which equals to 1.
4. The conditional statement `if position < 0 or index < 0` evaluates to False because neither `position` nor `index` is negative.
5. We convert the string `text` into a list of characters: `['u', 'n', 'd', 'b', 's', ' ', 'l']`.
6. We remove the element at the calculated `index` (1 in this case) from the list `new_text`. So, the character 'n' at index 1 is removed.
7. Finally, the remaining characters in the list `new_text` are joined together into a string: `'udbs l'`. 

Therefore, the output of executing the function `f` on the input "undbs l" and 1 is "udbs l".

'udbs l'
