<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes two strings as input, `full` and `part`, and counts how many times `part` appears in `full` without overlapping occurrences. Let's analyze how it processes the inputs `'hrsiajiajieihruejfhbrisvlmmy'` and `'hr'`:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `length = len(part)`: `length` is set to 2 (the length of `'hr'`).
   - `index = full.find(part)`: The first occurrence of `'hr'` in `full` is found at index 0. 
   - `count = 0`: The counter for occurrences is initialized to 0.

2. **First Iteration of the loop:**
   - `while index >= 0:`: Since `index` is 0 (greater than or equal to 0), the loop is entered.
   - `full = full[index + length:]`:  We update `full` to be the substring starting after the first occurrence of `'hr'`. `full` becomes `'siajiajieihruejfhbrisvlmmy'`.
   - `index = full.find(part)`: The next occurrence of `'hr'` is found at index 10.
   - `count += 1`: The count is incremented to 1.

3. **Second Iteration of the loop:**
   - `while index >= 0:`: `index` is 10, so the loop continues.
   - `full = full[index + length:]`:  `full` is updated to `'uejfhbrisvlmmy'`.
   - `index = full.find(part)`:  `'hr'` is found at index 4.
   - `count += 1`: The count is incremented to 2.

4. **Third Iteration of the loop:**
   - `while index >= 0:`:  `index` is 4, the loop continues.
   - `full = full[index + length:]`: `full` is updated to `'isvlmmy'`.
   - `index = full.find(part)`:  No more occurrences of `'hr'` are found in `full`, so `index` is set to -1.
   - `count += 1`: The count is incremented to 3.

5. **Loop Termination:**
   - `while index >= 0:`:  `index` is now -1, so the loop condition is false, and the loop ends.

6. **Return:**
   - `return count`: The function returns the final value of `count`, which is 3.
