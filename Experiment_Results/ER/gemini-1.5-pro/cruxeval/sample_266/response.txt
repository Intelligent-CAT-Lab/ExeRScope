The function `f` takes a list of numbers `nums` as input. 
It then iterates over the list in reverse order using a `for` loop with `range(len(nums)-1, -1, -1)`. This means `i` will take on values from the last index of `nums` down to 0.

For each element `nums[i]`, the code checks if it's odd using the modulo operator (`nums[i] % 2 == 1`). 
If the element is odd, the code inserts a copy of that element (`nums[i]`) into the list at index `i+1`. This effectively duplicates the odd number, placing the duplicate immediately to the right of the original.

Let's walk through the code with the input `[2, 3, 4, 6, -2]`:

1. `i = 4`: `nums[4] = -2` is even. No change to `nums`.
2. `i = 3`: `nums[3] = 6` is even. No change to `nums`.
3. `i = 2`: `nums[2] = 4` is even. No change to `nums`.
4. `i = 1`: `nums[1] = 3` is odd.  `nums` becomes `[2, 3, 3, 4, 6, -2]`
5. `i = 0`: `nums[0] = 2` is even. No change to `nums`.

Finally, the function returns the modified list `nums`.

[2, 3, 3, 4, 6, -2]
