1. The function `f` takes three arguments: `text`, `lower`, and `upper`. In this case, `text = 'DSUWeqExTQdCMGpqur'`, `lower = 'a'`, and `upper = 'x'`.
2. It initializes two variables: `count = 0` and `new_text = []`.
3. The code then iterates through each character in the `text`.
4. For each `char`:
    - If the character is a digit (`char.isdecimal()`), the variable `char` is assigned the value of `lower` which is 'a'. Otherwise, `char` is assigned the value of `upper` which is 'x'.
    - It checks if the character is either 'p' or 'C'. If it is, `count` is incremented by 1.
    - The character is appended to the `new_text` list.
5. Finally, the function returns a tuple containing the `count` of 'p' and 'C' characters found in the text and the `new_text` joined as a string.

Let's apply this to the input `f('DSUWeqExTQdCMGpqur', 'a', 'x')`:

- `count` is initialized to 0.
- `new_text` is initialized as an empty list: `[]`.
- The code iterates through each character in `'DSUWeqExTQdCMGpqur'`:
    - 'D' is not a digit, so it's replaced with 'x' and appended to `new_text`. `new_text` is now `['x']`.
    - 'S', 'U', 'W', 'e', 'q', 'E', 'x', 'T', 'Q' are not digits, so they're replaced with 'x' and appended to `new_text`.
    - 'd' is a digit, so it's replaced with 'a' and appended to `new_text`. `new_text` is now `['x', 'x', 'x', 'x', 'x', 'x', 'x', 'x', 'x', 'a']`.
    - 'C' matches the condition `char in ['p', 'C']`, so `count` is incremented to 1. 'C' is replaced with 'x' and appended to `new_text`.
    - 'M', 'G', 'p' are not digits, so they're replaced with 'x' and appended to `new_text`. 'p' matches the condition `char in ['p', 'C']`, so `count` is incremented to 2.
    - 'q', 'u', 'r' are not digits, so they're replaced with 'x' and appended to `new_text`. 
- Finally, `new_text` is `['x', 'x', 'x', 'x', 'x', 'x', 'x', 'x', 'x', 'a', 'x', 'x', 'x', 'x', 'x', 'x', 'x']`.
- The function returns `(2, 'xxxxxxxxxaxxxxxx')`.

<<<Output>>>
(2, 'xxxxxxxxxaxxxxxx')
