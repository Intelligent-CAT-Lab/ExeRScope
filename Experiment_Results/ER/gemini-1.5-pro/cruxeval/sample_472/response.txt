<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes a string `text` as input and aims to count the occurrences of each character (case-insensitive and ignoring hyphens), then return a sorted list of the counts.

1. **Initialization:**
   - `d = {}`: An empty dictionary `d` is created to store character counts.

2. **Iterating and Counting:**
   - `for char in text.replace('-', '').lower():`: The code iterates through each character in the input `text` after removing hyphens (`replace('-', '')`) and converting it to lowercase (`lower()`).
     - For each `char`:
       - `d[char] = d[char] + 1 if char in d else 1`: This line checks if the character `char` already exists as a key in the dictionary `d`.
         - If it exists (`char in d`), it increments the corresponding value (`d[char] + 1`).
         - If it doesn't exist, it adds the character as a key to the dictionary with a count of 1 (`else 1`).

3. **Sorting:**
   - `d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])`: The `d.items()` method returns a list of (key, value) pairs from the dictionary. This list is then sorted using the `sorted` function.
     - `key=lambda x: x[1]`: This lambda function specifies that the sorting should be based on the second element (`x[1]`) of each tuple in the list, which represents the character count.

4. **Returning Counts:**
   - `return [val for i, val in d]`: This list comprehension iterates through the sorted list of (character, count) pairs (`d`) and extracts only the counts (`val`) into a new list, which is then returned as the result.

Applying these steps to the input "x--y-z-5-C":
- After removing hyphens and lowercasing: "xyz5c"
- Character counts: {'x': 1, 'y': 1, 'z': 1, '5': 1, 'c': 1}
- Sorted list of counts: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]

<<<Output>>>
[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
