<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes a list `list_x` as input. 

1. **Initialization:**
   - It first calculates the length of the input list using `len(list_x)` and stores it in the variable `item_count`. In this case, `item_count` would be 5.
   - An empty list called `new_list` is created.

2. **Looping and Popping:**
   - The code then enters a `for` loop that iterates from `0` up to (but not including) `item_count` (which is 5).
   - In each iteration of the loop:
     - `list_x.pop()`: This part removes the last element from `list_x` and returns it. 
     - `new_list.append(...)`: The popped element is then appended to `new_list`.

3. **Reverse Order:**
   - Since `pop()` removes elements from the end of the list, the loop effectively processes the input list in reverse order.

4. **Return:**
   - Finally, the function returns `new_list`, which now contains the elements of the original list in reversed order.

Therefore, when the function `f` is called with the input list `[5, 8, 6, 8, 4]`, it will return a new list with the elements in reversed order.

<<<Output>>>
[4, 8, 6, 8, 5]
