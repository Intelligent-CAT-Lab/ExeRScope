1. The function `f` takes a list `values` and a value `value` as input. In this case, `values` is `['0', '3']` and `value` is `117`.
2. Inside the function:
    - `length = len(values)` calculates the length of the list `values`, which is 2. This variable is not used further in the code.
    - `new_dict = dict.fromkeys(values, value)` creates a new dictionary where each element in `values` becomes a key and `value` is the value for all keys. So, `new_dict` becomes `{'0': 117, '3': 117}`.
    - `''.join(sorted(values))` first sorts `values` to `['0', '3']`, then joins the elements using an empty string, resulting in `'03'`.
    -  `new_dict[''.join(sorted(values))] = value * 3` calculates `value * 3` which is `351` and assigns it to the key `'03'` in `new_dict`. 
3. Finally, the function returns `new_dict`.

Therefore, the output of executing the function `f` on the input `['0', '3']` and `117` is a dictionary with keys '0', '3', and '03' with corresponding values `117`, `117`, and `351`.

<<<Output>>>
{'0': 117, '3': 117, '03': 351}
