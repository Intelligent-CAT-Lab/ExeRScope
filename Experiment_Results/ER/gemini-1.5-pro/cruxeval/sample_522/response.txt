<<<Analysis>>>
1. **Input:** The function `f` takes a list-like object `numbers` as input. In this case, it's `range(100, 120)`, which represents numbers from 100 to 119.

2. **List Comprehension:** The line `floats = [n % 1 for n in numbers]` calculates the modulo 1 for each number in the input range. The modulo operator (`%`) returns the remainder of a division. For whole numbers, the modulo 1 operation will always result in 0.0.

3. **Conditional Return:**
   - The code then checks if `1` is present in the `floats` list (`if 1 in floats`).
   - Since the `floats` list will contain only 0.0 values (as all numbers in the input range are whole), the condition `1 in floats` will be False.
   - Therefore, the function will return an empty list (`[]`).
