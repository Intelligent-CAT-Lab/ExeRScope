<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes an integer `num` as input and aims to calculate a sum based on a pattern generated within the loop. Let's break down its execution step-by-step with `num = 3`:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `initial = [1]`: A list `initial` is initialized with the value `1`.
   - `total = initial`:  Another list `total` is created, initially a copy of `initial`.

2. **Iteration 1:**
   - `range(num)` leads to three iterations as `num` is 3.
   - Inside the loop:
     - `total = [1] + [x+y for x, y in zip(total, total[1:])]`: This line calculates the new `total` list. Let's break it further:
        - `zip(total, total[1:])`: This creates pairs of consecutive elements from `total`. In the first iteration, `total` is `[1]`, so this results in an empty zip object, as there are no consecutive pairs.
        - `[x+y for x, y in ...]`:  Since the `zip` object is empty, this list comprehension doesn't iterate, resulting in an empty list `[]`.
        - `[1] + []`: Finally, `1` is appended to the empty list, resulting in `total` being `[1]`.
     - `initial.append(total[-1])`: The last element of `total` (which is `1`) is appended to `initial`, making `initial` equal to `[1, 1]`.

3. **Iteration 2:**
   - `zip(total, total[1:])`: Now, `total` is `[1]`. Again, the `zip` results in an empty object.
   - The list comprehension results in an empty list, and `total` becomes `[1]` after adding `[1]` to the empty list.
   - `initial` is appended with `1`, becoming `[1, 1, 1]`.

4. **Iteration 3:**
   - Similar to the previous iterations, `total` remains `[1]` and `initial` becomes `[1, 1, 1, 1]`.

5. **Return:**
   - `sum(initial)`: The sum of all elements in `initial` (which is `[1, 1, 1, 1]`) is calculated and returned.
