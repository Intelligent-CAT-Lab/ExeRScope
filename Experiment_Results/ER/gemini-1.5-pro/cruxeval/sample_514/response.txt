<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes a string `text` as input and aims to remove hyphenated words and surrounding hyphens. Let's break down its execution step by step with the input `'-stew---corn-and-beans-in soup-.-'`:

1. **Splitting the text:**
   - `text.split()`: This splits the input string by spaces, resulting in the following list: `['-stew---corn-and-beans-in', 'soup-.-']`.

2. **Iterating through the words:**
   - The code enters a loop, iterating through each `item` in the list created in step 1.

     - **Iteration 1: `item = '-stew---corn-and-beans-in'`**
       - `text.replace('-{}'.format(item), ' ')`: This replaces occurrences of `'-stew---corn-and-beans-in'` with a space. Since this exact string doesn't appear within `text` itself, nothing changes.
       - `text.replace('{}-'.format(item), ' ')`: Similarly, this looks for occurrences of `'-stew---corn-and-beans-in-'`, which also doesn't exist in `text`, so nothing changes.

     - **Iteration 2: `item = 'soup-.-'`**
       - `text.replace('-{}'.format(item), ' ')`: Replaces `'-soup-.-'` with a space.  `text` becomes `'-stew---corn-and-beans-in   '`.
       - `text.replace('{}-'.format(item), ' ')`: Replaces `'soup-.--'` with a space (even though it's not present). `text` remains `'-stew---corn-and-beans-in   '`.

3. **Final Stripping:**
   - `text.strip('-')`: After the loop, this line removes leading and trailing hyphens from `text`. The final result is `'stew---corn-and-beans-in   '` (note the extra spaces, which are not removed).

<<<Output>>>
'stew---corn-and-beans-in   '
