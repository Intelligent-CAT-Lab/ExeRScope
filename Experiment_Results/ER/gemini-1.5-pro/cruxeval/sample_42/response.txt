<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes a list `nums` as input and aims to modify it. Let's break down its execution step-by-step with the input `[4, 3, 2, 1, 2, -1, 4, 2]`:

1. `nums.clear()`: This line removes all elements from the list `nums`. So, `nums` becomes an empty list: `[]`.

2. `for num in nums:`: This loop intends to iterate over each element in `nums`. However, since `nums` was cleared in the previous step, there are no elements to iterate over. The loop doesn't execute.

3. `return nums`: The function returns the current state of `nums`, which is an empty list `[]`.

Therefore, due to the `nums.clear()` operation at the beginning, the function will always return an empty list regardless of the input.
