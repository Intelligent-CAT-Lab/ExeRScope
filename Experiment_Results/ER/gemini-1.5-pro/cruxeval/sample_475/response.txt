<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes an array and an index as input. It first checks if the index is negative. If it is, the index is recalculated as the length of the array plus the index. Then, the element at the calculated index in the array is returned. 

1. **Input:** `array = [1], index = 0`
2. **Check if index is negative:** `0 < 0` is False.
3. **Index remains unchanged:** `index = 0`.
4. **Access and return the element at index 0:** `array[0]` which is `1`. 

Therefore, the output of the function `f` with the input `([1], 0)` is `1`.
