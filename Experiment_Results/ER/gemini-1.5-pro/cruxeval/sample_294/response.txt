1. The function `f` takes three inputs: `n`, `m`, and `text`. In this case, `n` is "x", `m` is "$", and `text` is "2xz&5H3*1a@#a*1hris".

2. It first checks if `text.strip()` is an empty string. In this case, `text.strip()` is not empty, so the code proceeds to the next step.

3. The code then assigns the first, the middle part, and the last character of the string  to `head`, `mid` and `tail` respectively. So `head` is "2", `mid` is "xz&5H3*1a@#a*1hri", and `tail` is "s". 

4. For each of the `head`, `mid`, and `tail`, the code replaces all occurrences of `n` with `m`. 
    *  Since `head` is "2", which doesn't contain "x", `head.replace(n, m)` remains "2".
    * `mid.replace(n, m)` replaces "x" with "$" in the `mid` resulting in "z$&5H3*1a@#a*1hri".
    *  Similar to the `head`, `tail.replace(n, m)` results in "s". 

5. Finally, it concatenates the modified `head`, `mid`, and `tail` to form the final output string. 

Therefore, the output of the function would be "2z$&5H3*1a@#a*1hris".

2z$&5H3*1a@#a*1hris
