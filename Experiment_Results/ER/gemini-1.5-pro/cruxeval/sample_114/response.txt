<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes two arguments: `text` which is a string and `sep` which is the separator string. It then uses the `rsplit()` method on the input `text`.  The `rsplit()` method splits the string from the right, at the specified separator `sep`. The `maxsplit` argument is set to 2, which means the string will be split at most 2 times (from the right).

Here's how the code processes the input:

1. **Input:** `text = "a-.-.b"`, `sep = "-.-"`
2. **Splitting:** The code starts looking for the separator `"-.-"` from the right of the string `a-.-.b`. It finds one occurrence of the separator.
3. **First Split:** The string is split into two parts: `"a"` and `"b"`.
4. **Second Split:** Since `maxsplit` is 2, the code attempts to split the left part (`"a"`) again. However, it can't find any more occurrences of  `"-.-"`.
5. **Result:** The final result is a list containing the split parts: `["a", "b"]`.

<<<Output>>>
['a', 'b']
