1. The function `f` takes a string `text` as input. In this case, the input is 'scala'.
2. Inside the function, `ls = text[::-1]` reverses the input string. So, `ls` becomes 'alacs'.
3. An empty string `text2` is initialized. This variable will store the modified string.
4. The code then iterates through the reversed string `ls` in steps of 3 in reverse order using `range(len(ls) - 3, 0, -3)`.  Since the length of `ls` is 5, the loop will iterate through the following indices: 2.
    - When i = 2, `ls[i:i+3]` takes the substring of `ls` from index 2 to 4 (exclusive), resulting in 'lac'. This substring is then joined with '---', giving 'l---a---c---'. Finally, this string is concatenated with the current value of `text2`, resulting in `text2` being 'l---a---c---'.
5. After the loop completes, `text2[:-3]` removes the last three characters ('---') from `text2`. Therefore, the final value of `text2` becomes 'l---a---c'.
6. This final value of `text2` is returned as the output of the function.

'l---a---c'
