<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes an integer `n` and a list `array` as input. It aims to create a list of lists, where each inner list is a progressively extended version of the input `array`.

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `final = [array.copy()]`: A list called `final` is created, initially containing a single element which is a copy of the input `array`. So, `final` starts as `[[1, 2, 3]]`.

2. **Loop Execution**: The `for` loop runs for `n` iterations (in this case, `n = 1`, so the loop runs once).
   - **Iteration 1**:
     - `arr = array.copy()`: A copy of the original `array` is created, `arr` becomes `[1, 2, 3]`.
     - `arr.extend(final[-1])`: The last element of `final` (which is `[1, 2, 3]`) is extended to `arr`. Now, `arr` becomes `[1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]`.
     - `final.append(arr)`: The modified `arr` is appended to `final`. 

3. **Return Value**: After the loop, `final` is returned.

Therefore, after executing the function with the given input, the final value of `final` would be `[[1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]]`.

<<<Output>>>
[[1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]]
