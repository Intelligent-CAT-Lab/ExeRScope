<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes two arguments: a string called `string` and an integer called `encryption`. 

1. **Input:** The function is called with the arguments `string = 'UppEr'` and `encryption = 0`.

2. **Conditional Statement:** The code checks if the value of `encryption` is equal to 0. Since `encryption` is indeed 0, the code inside the `if` block will execute.

3. **Return Original String:** The code inside the `if` block simply returns the original `string` without any modifications.

Therefore, the function will return the original string 'UppEr'.
<<<Output>>>
'UppEr'
