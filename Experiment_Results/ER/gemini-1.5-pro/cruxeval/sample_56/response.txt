<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes a string `sentence` as input and iterates over each character `c` in the sentence. For each character, it checks if it's an ASCII character using `isascii()`. If it's not an ASCII character, the function immediately returns `False`. If the loop completes without finding any non-ASCII characters, it means all characters are ASCII, and the function returns `True`.

In the case of `f('1z1z1')`, the function will iterate over each character: '1', 'z', '1', 'z', '1'. All of these characters are ASCII characters, so the `isascii()` check will always return `True`, and the loop will continue. Since no non-ASCII characters are found, the function will return `True`.
