<<<Analysis>>>
1. The function `f` takes two arguments: `text` and `value`. In this case, `text` is "!?" and `value` is "".
2. `len(value)` calculates the length of the string `value`, which is 0.
3. `text.ljust(len(value), "?")` attempts to left-justify the string `text` to a width of 0 using the character "?". However, since the target width is 0, and the length of `text` is already greater than 0, the string remains unchanged.

Therefore, the output of the function `f("!?", "")` is "!?".
