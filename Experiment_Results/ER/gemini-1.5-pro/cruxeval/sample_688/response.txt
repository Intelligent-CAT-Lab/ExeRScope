<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes a list of numbers `nums` as input and returns a new list `l` containing only the unique elements of `nums`, in the order they first appeared.

1. **Initialization:** `l` is initialized as an empty list.
2. **Iteration:** The code then iterates over each element `i` in the input list `nums`.
3. **Check for uniqueness:** For each element `i`, the code checks if `i` is already in the list `l`.
4. **Appending unique elements:** If `i` is not already in `l`, it is appended to the end of `l`. This ensures that each unique element is added to `l` only once.
5. **Return:** Finally, after processing all elements in `nums`, the function returns the list `l` containing all the unique elements.

When the function is called with `[3, 1, 9, 0, 2, 0, 8]`, it will process each element and check if it's already in the list `l`. 
   - `3` is not in `l`, so it's appended to `l`. `l` is now `[3]`.
   - `1` is not in `l`, so it's appended to `l`. `l` is now `[3, 1]`.
   - `9` is not in `l`, so it's appended to `l`. `l` is now `[3, 1, 9]`.
   - `0` is not in `l`, so it's appended to `l`. `l` is now `[3, 1, 9, 0]`.
   - `2` is not in `l`, so it's appended to `l`. `l` is now `[3, 1, 9, 0, 2]`.
   - `0` is already in `l`, so it's not appended. `l` remains `[3, 1, 9, 0, 2]`.
   - `8` is not in `l`, so it's appended to `l`. `l` is now `[3, 1, 9, 0, 2, 8]`.

Therefore, the function will return the list `[3, 1, 9, 0, 2, 8]`.
