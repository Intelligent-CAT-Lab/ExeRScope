<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes three arguments: `s` (a string), `from_c` (a character), and `to_c` (another character). It then replaces all occurrences of `from_c` in `s` with `to_c`.

1. **`table = s.maketrans(from_c, to_c)`**: This line creates a translation table using the `maketrans()` method. In this case, it creates a table where the character 'i' maps to '?'. 

2. **`return s.translate(table)`**: This line uses the translation table created in the previous step to replace characters in the string `s`. It finds all occurrences of 'i' in the string 'aphid' and replaces them with '?'.

Therefore, the output of the function would be 'aph?d'.
