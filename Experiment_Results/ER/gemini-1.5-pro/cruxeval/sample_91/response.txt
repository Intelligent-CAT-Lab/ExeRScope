The function `f` takes a string `s` as input and aims to return a list of unique characters present in the string. Let's break down how it achieves this:

1. **`d = dict.fromkeys(s, 0)`**: This line creates a dictionary `d`. 
    - The `dict.fromkeys(s, 0)` method initializes a dictionary where the keys are obtained from the input string `s`.
    - Each key in the dictionary is assigned a default value of `0`. Since we are only interested in the unique characters, the values in the dictionary don't hold particular significance in this case.
2. **`return list(d.keys())`**: This line returns a list containing the keys of the dictionary `d`. 
    - `d.keys()` fetches a view of the keys from the dictionary.
    - `list(d.keys())` converts this view into a list.

Since dictionaries cannot have duplicate keys, the resulting list will contain each unique character from the input string only once. 

Applying this to the input "12ab23xy":

1. `dict.fromkeys("12ab23xy", 0)` creates a dictionary with keys '1', '2', 'a', 'b', '3', 'x', 'y'.
2. `list(d.keys())` then returns a list containing these keys.

<<<Output>>>
['1', '2', 'a', 'b', '3', 'x', 'y']
