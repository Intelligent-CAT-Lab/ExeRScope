<<<Analysis>>>
1. The function `f` takes two arguments: `seq` (a sequence) and `value` (a string).
2. Inside the function, `dict.fromkeys(seq, 'north')` creates a new dictionary called `roles`. This dictionary will have keys from the `seq` list and each key will be assigned the initial value 'north'. In this case, `seq` is `['wise king', 'young king']`, so `roles` will be initialized as `{'wise king': 'north', 'young king': 'north'}`.
3. The code then enters an `if` statement that checks if the `value` is not empty. In this case, `value` is an empty string (`''`), which evaluates to False. Therefore, the code inside the `if` block will not be executed. 
4. Finally, the function returns the `roles` dictionary.

Therefore, the output of executing the function `f` on the input `['wise king', 'young king']` and `''` is `{'wise king': 'north', 'young king': 'north'}`.

<<<Output>>>
{'wise king': 'north', 'young king': 'north'}
