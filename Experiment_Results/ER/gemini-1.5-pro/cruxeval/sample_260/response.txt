<<<Analysis>>>
1. **Input:** The function `f` receives the following inputs:
   - `nums`: A list of numbers: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`
   - `start`:  The starting index for reversing: `4`
   - `k`: The length of the sublist to reverse: `2`

2. **Slicing:**
   - `nums[start:start+k]`: This slices the list `nums` from index `4` (inclusive) to `6` (exclusive) resulting in the sublist `[5, 6]`.

3. **Reversing:**
   - `[::-1]`: This slice reverses the sublist obtained in the previous step, resulting in `[6, 5]`.

4. **Assignment:**
   - `nums[start:start+k] = ...`:  This part takes the reversed sublist `[6, 5]` and places it back into the original `nums` list at the same indices (`4` and `5`).

5. **Return:**
   - `return nums`: The function returns the modified `nums` list.

Therefore, the function effectively reverses a portion of the input list defined by `start` and `k`.

<<<Output>>>
[1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 5]
