<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` iterates through the input list `nums` in reverse order, starting from the second-to-last element (index `len(nums) - 2`) and going down to the first element (index `0`) with a step of `-1`. 

For each element `nums[i]`, it checks if it's divisible by 2 (`nums[i] % 2 == 0`). If it is, the function removes the element from the list `nums`.

Let's analyze the execution step-by-step for the input `[5, 3, 3, 7]`:

1. `i` starts at index 2 (value 3). 3 is not divisible by 2, so nothing happens. 
2. `i` becomes 1 (value 3). 3 is not divisible by 2, so nothing happens.
3. `i` becomes 0 (value 5). 5 is not divisible by 2, so nothing happens.
4. The loop ends because `i` reached -1.

Since none of the numbers in the list are divisible by 2, the list remains unchanged.

Therefore, the output of the function is the original list.
