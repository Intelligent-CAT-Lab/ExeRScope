<<<Analysis>>>
1. The function `f` first checks if the `char` (' ') is present in the `text` ('only one line'). It is, so it proceeds to the code within the `if` statement.
2. The `text` is split into a list of strings using the `char` (' ') as the delimiter: `['only', 'one', 'line']`.
3. The `strip()` method is applied to each element of the list to remove leading/trailing whitespaces. However, there are none in this case, so the list remains the same.
4. The `if t` condition within the list comprehension filters out any empty strings.  Since there are no empty strings, the list remains: `['only', 'one', 'line']`.
5. The length of the resulting list is checked. Since the length is 3, which is greater than 1, the condition `len(text) > 1` evaluates to `True`, and the function returns `True`.
