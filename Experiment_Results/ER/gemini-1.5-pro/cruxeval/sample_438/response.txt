<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes a string as input and aims to customize the tab spacing within the string. Let's break down its execution with the input '1  \t\t\t3':

1. **Initialization:**
   - `bigTab` is initially set to 100. This variable will be used to determine the final tab spacing.

2. **Looping for Tab Count:**
   - The `for` loop iterates from 10 to 29 (exclusive of 30).
   - In each iteration, `string.count('\t')` counts the occurrences of tab characters ('\t') in the input string '1  \t\t\t3'. The count is 3.
   - The `if` condition checks if this count is between 0 and 20 (exclusive). Since 3 falls within this range, the condition is met.
   - Inside the `if` block:
     - `bigTab` is updated to the current value of `i`, which is 10 in the first iteration.
     - The `break` statement immediately terminates the `for` loop, so the subsequent iterations are skipped.

3. **Expanding Tabs:**
   - After the loop, `string.expandtabs(bigTab)` is called. This method replaces each tab character in the input string with spaces, using `bigTab` (now 10) as the desired tab size.

Therefore, the function expands the tabs in the string '1  \t\t\t3' with a tab size of 10.

<<<Output>>>
'1          3'
