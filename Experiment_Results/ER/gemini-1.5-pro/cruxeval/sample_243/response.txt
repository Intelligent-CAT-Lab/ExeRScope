<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes two strings as input, `text` and `char`. It then evaluates two conditions:

1. **`char.islower()`:** This checks if the character `'e'` is lowercase. Since 'e' is indeed lowercase, this condition is True.
2. **`text.islower()`:** This checks if all characters in the string `'abc'` are lowercase.  Since all characters ('a', 'b', and 'c') are lowercase, this condition is also True.

Finally, the function uses the `and` operator. This means the function will return `True` only if *both* conditions are True. In this case, both conditions are indeed True.

<<<Output>>>
True
