<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes an array as input and aims to remove consecutive duplicate elements. Let's analyze its execution with the input `[1, 2, 3]`:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `prev = array[0]`: `prev` is set to `1` (the first element of the input array).
   - `newArray = array[:]`: `newArray` is initialized as a copy of the input array `[1, 2, 3]`.

2. **Iteration:**
   - The `for` loop iterates through the array starting from the second element (index 1).
     - **Iteration 1 (i = 1):**
       - `if prev != array[i]`: This condition checks if the previous element (`prev = 1`) is not equal to the current element (`array[1] = 2`). This condition is True.
       - `newArray[i] = array[i]`: Since the condition is True, `newArray[1]` is set to `array[1]` (which is 2). `newArray` is now `[1, 2, 3]`.
       - `prev = array[i]`: `prev` is updated to `2`.
     - **Iteration 2 (i = 2):**
       - `if prev != array[i]`: This condition checks if the previous element (`prev = 2`) is not equal to the current element (`array[2] = 3`). This condition is True.
       - `newArray[i] = array[i]`: Since the condition is True, `newArray[2]` is set to `array[2]` (which is 3). `newArray` is now `[1, 2, 3]`.
       - `prev = array[i]`: `prev` is updated to `3`.

3. **Return:**
   - After the loop completes, the function returns `newArray`, which is `[1, 2, 3]`.

[1, 2, 3]
