<<<Analysis>>>
1. The function `f` takes a list `nums` as input. 
2. It creates two new lists: `asc` and `desc`. 
3. `asc` is initialized as a copy of `nums`, and then reversed.
4. `desc` is then assigned the first half of `asc`.
5. Finally, the function returns a new list formed by concatenating `desc`, `asc`, and `desc`. 
6. Since the input is an empty list, both `asc` and `desc` will be empty lists as well. 
7. Therefore, the function will return an empty list.
