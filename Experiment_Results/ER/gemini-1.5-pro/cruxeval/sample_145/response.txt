<<<Analysis>>>
1. **Function call:** The code first executes the function `f` with the arguments `price = 8.50` and `product = 'grapes'`.
2. **Inventory Check:** Inside the function, it checks if the given `product` ('grapes') is present in the `inventory` list. Since 'grapes' is not in the list, the condition `product not in inventory` evaluates to `True`.
3. **Price Return:** As the condition in the `if` statement is `True`, the function directly returns the original `price` which is `8.50`. 

<<<Output>>>
8.50
