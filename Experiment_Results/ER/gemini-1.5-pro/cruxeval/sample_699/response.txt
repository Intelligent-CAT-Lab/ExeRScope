<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes two strings as input, `text` and `elem`. 

1. It first checks if `elem` is not an empty string. In this case, `elem` is "1", which is not empty, so the code enters the if block.

2. Inside the if block, there are two while loops. 
    - The first `while` loop checks if `text` starts with `elem`. In this case, "some" does not start with "1", so the loop is not entered.
    - The second `while` loop checks if `elem` starts with `text`. Here, "1" does not start with "some", so this loop is also not entered.

3. Finally, the function returns a list containing `elem` and `text`, which are "1" and "some" respectively.

<<<Output>>>
['1', 'some']
