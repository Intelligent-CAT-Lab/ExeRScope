<<<Analysis>>>
1. The function `f` takes a string `text` as input, which is "dog,cat" in this case.
2. Inside the function, `text.split(',')` splits the input string at the comma, resulting in two substrings: "dog" and "cat".
3. These substrings are assigned to the variables `string_a` and `string_b` respectively.
4. The code then calculates the length of `string_a` (which is 3) and the length of `string_b` (which is 3).
5. It adds these lengths together (3 + 3 = 6).
6. Finally, the result is negated by the unary minus operator, resulting in -6.
7. Therefore, the function `f` returns -6.

<<<Output>>>
-6
