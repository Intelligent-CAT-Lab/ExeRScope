The function `f` takes a string `st` as input and aims to reverse the string while swapping the case of each character. Let's break down how it processes the input "RTiGM":

1. **Initialization:**
   - `swapped = ''`: An empty string `swapped` is created to store the result.

2. **Iterating through the string in reverse:**
   - `reversed('RTiGM')` yields each character from the end to the beginning: 'M', 'G', 'i', 'T', 'R'.

3. **Processing each character:**
   - For each character `ch` in the reversed string:
     - `ch.swapcase()`: This swaps the case of the character. For example:
       - 'M' becomes 'm'
       - 'G' becomes 'g'
       - 'i' becomes 'I'
       - 'T' becomes 't'
       - 'R' becomes 'r'
     - `swapped += ...`: The case-swapped character is then appended to the `swapped` string.

4. **Loop execution:**
   - The loop continues this process for each character in `reversed('RTiGM')`.

5. **Result:**
   - After processing all characters, the `swapped` string will contain 'mgItR', which is the reversed string with swapped cases.

6. **Return Value:**
   - The function returns the `swapped` string, which is 'mgItR'.

Therefore, the output of executing the function `f` on the input "RTiGM" is "mgItR".

'mgItR'
