<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes a list `nums` as input and aims to remove all odd numbers from it, then return the sum of the remaining elements. Let's break down how it processes the input `[11, 21, 0, 11]`:

1. **Iteration over a copy:**
   - `nums[:]`: This creates a shallow copy of the original `nums` list. The loop iterates over this copy to avoid modifying the list while iterating over it.
   - Inside the loop, it checks if each number (`odd`) is odd using the modulo operator (`%`).

2. **Removing odd numbers:**
   - If a number is odd (`odd % 2 != 0` is True), the code removes it from the original `nums` list using `nums.remove(odd)`. Note that this removal happens in the original list, not the copy being iterated over.

3. **Summing the remaining elements:**
   - After removing all odd numbers, the code initializes a variable `sum_` to 0.
   - It then iterates through the modified `nums` list (which now contains only even numbers).
   - In each iteration, it adds the current even number (`num`) to `sum_`.

4. **Returning the sum:**
   - Finally, the function returns the `sum_`, which represents the sum of all even numbers in the modified list.

Therefore, after processing the input `[11, 21, 0, 11]`, the `nums` list will be modified to `[0]`, and the `sum_` will be `0`.
