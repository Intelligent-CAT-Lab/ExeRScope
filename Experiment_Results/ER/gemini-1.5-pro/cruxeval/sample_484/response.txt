The function `f` takes a list of strings as input and iterates over each item in the list. For each item, it first tries to check if it's numeric using the `isnumeric()` method. If it is, it converts the item to an integer, multiplies it by 2, and appends the result to the `result` list. If the item is not numeric, it reverses the string using slicing `[::-1]` and appends the reversed string to the `result` list. Finally, it returns the `result` list.

Let's analyze the code step-by-step for the given input:

1. **'91':** '91' is numeric, so it's converted to an integer (91), multiplied by 2 (91 * 2 = 182), and appended to the `result` list.
2. **'16':** '16' is numeric, so it's converted to an integer (16), multiplied by 2 (16 * 2 = 32), and appended to the `result` list.
3. **'6r':** '6r' is not numeric. So, it's reversed ('6r'[::-1] = 'r6'), and 'r6' is appended to the `result` list.
4. **'5r':** '5r' is not numeric. So, it's reversed ('5r'[::-1] = 'r5'), and 'r5' is appended to the `result` list.
5. **'egr':** 'egr' is not numeric. So, it's reversed ('egr'[::-1] = 'rge'), and 'rge' is appended to the `result` list.
6. **'':** '' is not numeric. So, it's reversed (''[::-1] = ''), and '' is appended to the `result` list.
7. **'f':** 'f' is not numeric. So, it's reversed ('f'[::-1] = 'f'), and 'f' is appended to the `result` list.
8. **'q1f':** 'q1f' is not numeric. So, it's reversed ('q1f'[::-1] = 'f1q'), and 'f1q' is appended to the `result` list.
9. **'-2':** '-2' is numeric, so it's converted to an integer (-2), multiplied by 2 (-2 * 2 = -4), and appended to the `result` list.

Therefore, the final `result` list is `[182, 32, 'r6', 'r5', 'rge', '', 'f', 'f1q', -4]`.

<<<Output>>>
[182, 32, 'r6', 'r5', 'rge', '', 'f', 'f1q', -4]
