<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes a dictionary `array` and an element `elem` as input. Let's analyze its execution with the given input `({}, 1)`:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `result = array.copy()`: `result` becomes an empty dictionary `{}` after copying the input `array`.

2. **Loop Entry Condition:**
   - `while result:`: This condition checks if `result` is not empty. Since `result` is currently an empty dictionary, the loop doesn't execute. 

3. **Return:**
   - The function directly proceeds to return the empty dictionary `result`.

Therefore, due to the input being an empty dictionary, the loop within the function doesn't run, and the function returns an empty dictionary.

<<<Output>>>
{}
