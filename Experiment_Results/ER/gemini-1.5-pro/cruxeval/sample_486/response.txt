<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes a dictionary `dic` as input and aims to return a new dictionary `dic_op` where each value is the square of the corresponding value in the input dictionary. Let's break down how it achieves this:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `dic_op = dic.copy()`: This line creates a shallow copy of the input dictionary `dic` and assigns it to the variable `dic_op`. This ensures that any modifications made to `dic_op` will not affect the original `dic`.

2. **Iterating and Updating:**
   - `for key, val in dic.items()`: This loop iterates through each key-value pair in the input dictionary `dic`.
   - `dic_op[key] = val * val`: Inside the loop, for each `key`, the corresponding value `val` is squared (`val * val`), and this squared value is assigned back to the same `key` in the `dic_op` dictionary.

3. **Returning the Result:**
   - `return dic_op`: Finally, the function returns the modified dictionary `dic_op`.

Applying this to the input `{1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 3}`:

   - The loop iterates through each key-value pair: (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3).
   - For each pair, the value is squared and stored back in `dic_op` with the same key. 
   - Therefore, `dic_op` becomes `{1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9}`

<<<Output>>>
{1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9}
