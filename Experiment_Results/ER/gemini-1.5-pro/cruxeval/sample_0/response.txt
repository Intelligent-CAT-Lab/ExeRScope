The function `f` takes a list of numbers `nums` as input and returns a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the count of an element and the element itself, sorted in descending order of their frequency. Let's break down how the code processes the input `[1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1]`:

1. **Initialization**: An empty list called `output` is created to store the results.
2. **Iteration**: The code iterates through each element `n` in the input list `nums`.
3. **Counting and Appending**: For each element `n`, the code counts how many times it appears in `nums` using `nums.count(n)` and appends a tuple `(count, n)` to the `output` list. 
    * For the first element '1', the count is 4, so (4, 1) is appended to output.
    * For the second element '1', the count is still 4, so (4, 1) is appended again.
    * This continues for all elements, resulting in output being: [(4, 1), (4, 1), (2, 3), (4, 1), (2, 3), (4, 1)]
4. **Sorting**: The `output` list is sorted in reverse order using `output.sort(reverse=True)`, based on the first element of each tuple (the count).
    * This sorts the list into: [(4, 1), (4, 1), (4, 1), (4, 1), (2, 3), (2, 3)]
5. **Return**: The sorted `output` list is returned.

Therefore, for the input `[1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1]`, the function would return a list of tuples where each tuple represents (count, element) sorted by frequency.
