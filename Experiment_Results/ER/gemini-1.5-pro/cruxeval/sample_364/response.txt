1. **Define the input:**
   - `nums = [0, 3, 0, 1]` 
   - `verdict = lambda x: x < 2` (This is a lambda function that takes a number and returns True if it's less than 2, otherwise False)

2. **Execute the function `f(nums, verdict)`:**
   - `res = [x for x in nums if x != 0]` This line filters the `nums` list and keeps only the non-zero elements, resulting in `res = [3, 1]`.

   - `result = [[x, verdict(x)] for x in res]` This line iterates through `res` and for each element `x`, it creates a sublist containing `x` and the result of applying the `verdict` function to `x`.
     - For `x = 3`, `verdict(3)` returns `False` (since 3 is not less than 2). 
     - For `x = 1`, `verdict(1)` returns `True` (since 1 is less than 2).
     - Therefore, `result` becomes `[[3, False], [1, True]]`.

   - `if result:` This condition checks if `result` is not empty. Since `result` has elements, the code enters the `if` block.

   - `return result` The code returns the `result` list.

3. **Output:** The function execution ends, returning `[[3, False], [1, True]]`.

[[3, False], [1, True]]
