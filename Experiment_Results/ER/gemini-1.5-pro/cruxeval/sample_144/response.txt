<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes a list of lists as input, denoted as `vectors`. It aims to sort each inner list in ascending order and return a new list containing these sorted lists. 

1. **Initialization**: An empty list called `sorted_vecs` is created to store the sorted lists.
2. **Looping**: The code enters a `for` loop that iterates over each element (`vec`) within the input `vectors`.
    -  **However**, in the case of `f([])`, the input `vectors` is an empty list. This means the loop will not run as there are no elements to iterate over.
3. **Return**: Since the loop doesn't run, nothing is appended to `sorted_vecs`, and it remains empty. The function returns the empty list `sorted_vecs`.
