<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` first checks if the input `text` is in title case using `text.istitle()`. 
1.  Since "PermissioN is GRANTed" is not in title case, `text.istitle()` would return `False`. 
2.  As the condition in the `if` statement is met (`not False` is `True`), the function would execute the line  `return text.title()`.
3. This would convert the input string to title case: "Permission Is Granted". 

Therefore, the output of executing the function `f` on the input "PermissioN is GRANTed" is "Permission Is Granted". 
<<<Output>>>
'Permission Is Granted'
