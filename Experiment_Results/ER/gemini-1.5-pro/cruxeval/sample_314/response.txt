1. The function `f` takes a string `text` as input, in this case, `'244, 105, -90'`.
2. It first checks if a comma (`,`) is present in the `text`. Since our text does contain a comma, the code enters the `if` block.
3. Inside the `if` block:
    - `text.partition(',')` splits the string at the first occurrence of the comma and returns a tuple of three elements: the part before the comma (`'244'`), the comma itself (`,`), and the part after the comma (`' 105, -90'`).
    - These three elements are assigned to variables `before`, `_` (a throwaway variable for the comma), and `after`, respectively.
    - The function then returns the concatenated string of `after`, a space, and `before`, resulting in `' 105, -90 244'`.

<<<Output>>>
' 105, -90 244'
