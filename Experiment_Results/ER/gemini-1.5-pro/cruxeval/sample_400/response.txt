<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes a multi-word string as input and aims to extract the ASCII words from it. Let's break down how it processes the input `'I am hungry! eat food.'`:

1. **`multi_string.split()`:** The input string is split into a list of words: `['I', 'am', 'hungry!', 'eat', 'food.']`.
2. **`cond_string = map(str.isascii, multi_string.split())`:** This line applies the `isascii()` method to each word in the list using `map`. The `isascii()` method checks if all characters in a string are ASCII characters. The result is a map object, which is a generator-like object.
3. **`if True in cond_string`:** This line checks if there is any `True` in the `cond_string`. If any word is found to be entirely composed of ASCII characters, the condition becomes true.
4. **`return ', '.join(x for x in multi_string.split() if x.isascii())`:** Since there are ASCII words in the input, this line executes. It iterates through each word (`x`) in the split input string, and for each word, it checks `if x.isascii()`. If the word is entirely ASCII, it is included in a new list that will be joined with ', '.
5. **`return ''`:** This line would only execute if no ASCII words were found in the input.

Therefore, the function will return a string containing the ASCII words from the input string, separated by commas and spaces.

<<<Output>>>
'I, am, eat'
