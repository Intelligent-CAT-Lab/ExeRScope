<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes a string `text` and a character `value` as input. It then finds all occurrences of `value` in `text` and removes them. Here's how it does that step-by-step:

1. **Initialization**:
   - It creates an empty list called `indexes` to store the indices of `value` in `text`.
2. **Finding Indices**:
   - It iterates through each character of `text` using a `for` loop with `range(len(text))`.
   - For each character at index `i`, it checks if it's equal to `value`. 
   - If they match, it appends the index `i` to the `indexes` list.
3. **Removing Characters**:
   - It creates a new list `new_text` by converting the input string `text` into a list of characters. 
   - It then iterates through the `indexes` list.
   - For each index `i` in `indexes`, it removes the character at that index in `new_text`. **Note:** Removing elements while iterating over a list can lead to unexpected behavior.  It's important to be aware of this potential issue.
4. **Joining Characters**:
   - Finally, it joins the characters in `new_text` back into a string using `''.join(new_text)` and returns this string.

In the case of `f('scedvtvotkwqfoqn', 'o')`, the function will first identify that the character 'o' is present at indices 7, 10, and 14. It will then proceed to remove the 'o' characters at those positions within the string.

'scedvtvtkwqfqn'
