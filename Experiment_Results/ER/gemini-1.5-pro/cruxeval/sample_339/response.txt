<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes an array and an element as input. It then iterates through the array and checks how many times the element is present in the array.  

1. **Initialization:**
   - `elem = str(elem)`: The input element `2` is converted to a string, so `elem` now holds the value `"2"`.
   - `d = 0`: A counter variable `d` is initialized to 0. This variable will store the count of occurrences of the element in the array.

2. **Iteration and Comparison:**
   - The code enters a `for` loop that iterates through each element `i` in the input `array`([-1, 2, 1, -8, -8, 2]).
     - **Iteration 1:**
       - `i = -1`: The first element of the array is -1. 
       - `str(i) == elem`: This checks if `"-1"` is equal to `"2"`. Since they are not equal, `d` is not incremented.
     - **Iteration 2:**
       - `i = 2`: The second element of the array is 2.
       - `str(i) == elem`: This checks if `"2"` is equal to `"2"`. Since they are equal, `d` is incremented to 1.
     - **Iteration 3:**
       - `i = 1`
       - `str(i) == elem`: This checks if `"1"` is equal to `"2"`. Since they are not equal, `d` is not incremented.
     - **Iteration 4 & 5:**
       - `i = -8`
       - `str(i) == elem`: This checks if `"-8"` is equal to `"2"`. Since they are not equal, `d` is not incremented.
     - **Iteration 6:**
       - `i = 2`
       - `str(i) == elem`: This checks if `"2"` is equal to `"2"`. Since they are equal, `d` is incremented to 2. 

3. **Return Value:**
   - After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `d`, which represents the count of how many times the element was found in the array.
