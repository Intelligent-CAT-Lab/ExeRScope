<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` iterates through the key-value pairs of the input dictionary `d`. 

1. **First iteration:**
   -  `k` is `2` and `v` is `0.76`. 
   -  The condition `isinstance(k, float)` is `False` because `2` is an integer.
   -  The `else` block is executed, adding the key-value pair `2: 0.76` to the `result` dictionary.

2. **Second iteration:**
   - `k` is `5` and `v` is `[3, 6, 9, 12]`.
   - The condition `isinstance(k, float)` is `False` because `5` is an integer.
   - The `else` block is executed, adding the key-value pair `5: [3, 6, 9, 12]` to the `result` dictionary.

Therefore, after processing all key-value pairs, the `result` dictionary will be `{2: 0.76, 5: [3, 6, 9, 12]}`.

<<<Output>>>
```
{2: 0.76, 5: [3, 6, 9, 12]}
```
