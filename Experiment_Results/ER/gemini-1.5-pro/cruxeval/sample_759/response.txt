<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` aims to find all occurrences of the substring `sub` within the string `text`. It returns a list `index` containing the starting indices of all occurrences.

1. **Initialization**:
   - `index = []`: An empty list `index` is created to store the starting indices.
   - `starting = 0`:  A variable `starting` is initialized to 0, marking the beginning of the search within `text`.

2. **Looping to Find Occurrences**:
   - `while starting != -1:`: The code enters a loop that continues as long as `starting` is not -1.
   - `starting = text.find(sub, starting)`: In each iteration, the `find` method searches for the substring `sub` within `text` starting from the index `starting`. If `sub` is found, `starting` is updated to the starting index of the occurrence. If not found, `find` returns -1, and the loop terminates in the next iteration.
   - `if starting != -1:`: This condition checks if a match was found. 
     - `index.append(starting)`: If a match was found, the starting index is added to the `index` list.
     - `starting += len(sub)`:  The `starting` index is then moved forward by the length of `sub` to search for the next occurrence.

3. **Handling 'egmdartoa' and 'good'**:
   - In this case, the substring 'good' is not present in the string 'egmdartoa'. 

4. **Returning the Result**:
   - Finally, the function returns the `index` list, which will be empty in this case as no matches were found.
