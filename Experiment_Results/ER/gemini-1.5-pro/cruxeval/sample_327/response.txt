<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes a list `lst` as input and returns a new list `new` obtained by iterating through `lst` in reverse order and negating the elements at even indices.

1. **Initialization:**
   - A new empty list `new` is created.
   - The variable `i` is initialized to the index of the last element in `lst`, which is `len(lst) - 1 = 3`.

2. **Iteration 1:**
   - `i` is 3, which is odd. Therefore, `lst[i]` which is `lst[3]` = -3 is appended to `new`. 
   - `i` is then decremented to 2.

3. **Iteration 2:**
   - `i` is 2, which is even. Therefore, `-lst[i]` which is `-lst[2]` = 1 is appended to `new`. 
   - `i` is then decremented to 1.

4. **Iteration 3:**
   - `i` is 1, which is odd. Therefore, `lst[i]` which is `lst[1]` = 7 is appended to `new`. 
   - `i` is then decremented to 0.

5. **Iteration 4:**
   - `i` is 0, which is even. Therefore, `-lst[i]` which is `-lst[0]` = -1 is appended to `new`. 
   - `i` is then decremented to -1.

6. **Return:**
   - The loop finishes and the function returns the `new` list: `[-3, 1, 7, -1]`.

Therefore, the output of executing the function `f` on the input `[1, 7, -1, -3]` is `[-3, 1, 7, -1]`.

<<<Output>>>
[-3, 1, 7, -1]
