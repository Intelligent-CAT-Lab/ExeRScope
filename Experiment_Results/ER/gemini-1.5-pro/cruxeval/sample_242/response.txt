<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f(book)` aims to remove repeating words from a string, where the repeating words are adjacent and separated by a colon (':'). Let's break down how it processes the input:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `book = "udhv zcvi nhtnfyd : erwuyawa pun"` is the input to the function.

2. **First Split:**
   - `a = book.rsplit(':', 1)` splits the string `book` from the right using ':' as a delimiter, but only performing the split once. 
   - This results in: `a = ['udhv zcvi nhtnfyd ', 'erwuyawa pun']`

3. **Condition Check:**
   - `a[0].split(' ')[-1]` takes the first part of `a`, splits it by spaces, and fetches the last word, which is 'nhtnfyd'.
   - `a[1].split(' ')[0]` takes the second part of `a`, splits it by spaces, and fetches the first word, which is 'erwuyawa'.
   - The code compares these two words ('nhtnfyd' == 'erwuyawa'). Since they are not equal, the condition fails.

4. **Return Original String:**
   - As the condition fails, the function executes the `return book` statement, returning the original input string without any modifications. 

<<<Output>>>
'udhv zcvi nhtnfyd : erwuyawa pun'
