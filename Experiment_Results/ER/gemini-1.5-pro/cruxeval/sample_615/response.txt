<<<Analysis>>>
1. The function `f` takes a list `in_list` and a number `num` as input.
2. Inside the function, `in_list.append(num)` appends the `num` (-1 in this case) to the end of the `in_list`, so `in_list` becomes `[-1, 12, -6, -2, -1]`.
3. `in_list[:-1]` creates a new list that excludes the last element of `in_list`. So it would be `[-1, 12, -6, -2]`.
4. `max(in_list[:-1])` finds the maximum value in this sliced list, which is `12`.
5. `in_list.index(12)` finds the index of the first occurrence of the maximum value (12) in the entire `in_list`, which is `1`.
6. Therefore, the function `f` will return `1`.
