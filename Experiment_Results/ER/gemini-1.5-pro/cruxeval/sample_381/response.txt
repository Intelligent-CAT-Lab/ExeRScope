<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes two arguments: `text` which is a string and `num_digits` which represents the desired minimum width of the output string.

1. **Calculate `width`:**
   - `max(1, num_digits)` is used to determine the `width`. 
   - In this case, `max(1, 5)` returns `5` because 5 is greater than 1.

2. **Apply `zfill`:**
   - `text.zfill(width)` pads the `text` string with leading zeros until it reaches the desired `width`.
   - Since `text` is '19' and `width` is 5, `zfill` will add three leading zeros.

Therefore, the output of executing the function `f` on the input ('19', 5) is '00019'. 

<<<Output>>>
'00019'
