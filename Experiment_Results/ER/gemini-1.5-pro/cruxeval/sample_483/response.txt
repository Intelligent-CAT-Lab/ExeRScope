<<<Analysis>>>
1. The function `f` takes two arguments: `text` and `char`. In this case, `text` is "a" and `char` is "a".
2. Inside the function, `text.split(char, len(text))` is executed. 
    * `text.split(char, len(text))` splits the string `text` into a list of substrings at each occurrence of `char`, with a maximum of `len(text)` splits.
    * Since `text` is "a" and `char` is "a", it will split the string "a" at "a" with a maximum of 1 split (length of "a" is 1). This results in the list `['', '']`.
3. `' '.join(...)` joins the elements of the list obtained in the previous step using a space (' ') as a separator. 
    * Joining the elements of `['', '']` with a space results in the string " ". 
4. Therefore, the function `f('a', 'a')` returns the string " ".
