<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes a dictionary `d` as input and returns a tuple. Let's break down how it processes the input:

1. **Initialization:**
   - It creates an empty dictionary `r`.
   - `r['c'] = d.copy()`: This line creates a new key `'c'` in the dictionary `r` and assigns it a *copy* of the input dictionary `d`. 
   - `r['d'] = d.copy()`:  Similarly, this line creates another key `'d'` in `r` and assigns it a *separate* copy of the input dictionary `d`.

2. **Comparison:**
   - `r['c'] is r['d']`: This expression checks if the values associated with keys `'c'` and `'d'` in the dictionary `r` refer to the *same object* in memory. Since `.copy()` creates a *new* object, this comparison will be `False`.
   - `r['c'] == r['d']`: This expression checks if the values associated with keys `'c'` and `'d'` in the dictionary `r` have the same *content*. Since both are copies of the original input dictionary `d`, their content will be identical, making this comparison `True`.

3. **Return:**
   - The function returns a tuple `(False, True)`, reflecting the results of the two comparisons.

Therefore, when calling `f({'i': 1, 'love': 'parakeets'})`, the function will return a tuple indicating that the two copies of the input dictionary are not the same object in memory (`False`), but they have equivalent content (`True`).

<<<Output>>>
(False, True)
