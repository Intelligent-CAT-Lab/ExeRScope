<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes a string `text` as input and aims to count how many times a word surpasses the length of the previous words. 

1. **Initialization**:
   - `m = 0`: Initializes a variable `m` to store the maximum length encountered so far.
   - `cnt = 0`: Initializes a variable `cnt` to count the number of times a word's length exceeds the previous maximum.

2. **Iterating through words**:
   - `for i in text.split()`: The code splits the input string `text` into a list of words and iterates through each word `i`.

3. **Length comparison and update**:
   - `if len(i) > m:`: For each word `i`, its length is compared with the current maximum length `m`. 
   - If the current word's length is greater:
     - `cnt += 1`: The counter `cnt` is incremented.
     - `m = len(i)`: The maximum length `m` is updated to the current word's length.

4. **Return count**:
   - `return cnt`: After processing all words, the function returns the final count `cnt`.

Applying this to the input string `"wys silak v5 e4fi rotbi fwj 78 wigf t8s lcl"`:

- The code iterates through each word: "wys", "silak", "v5", ... "lcl".
- It compares the length of each word with the current maximum length (`m`). If a word's length is greater, `cnt` is incremented, and `m` is updated.

Let's break down how `cnt` and `m` change with each word:

| Word  | len(i) | m (before) | cnt (before) | m (after) | cnt (after) |
|-------|---------|-------------|--------------|------------|-------------|
| "wys" | 3       | 0           | 0            | 3          | 1           |
| "silak" | 5      | 3           | 1            | 5          | 2           |
| "v5"   | 2       | 5           | 2            | 5          | 2           |
| "e4fi" | 4       | 5           | 2            | 5          | 2           |
| "rotbi" | 5      | 5           | 2            | 5          | 2           |
| "fwj"  | 3       | 5           | 2            | 5          | 2           |
| "78"   | 2       | 5           | 2            | 5          | 2           |
| "wigf" | 4       | 5           | 2            | 5          | 2           |
| "t8s"  | 3       | 5           | 2            | 5          | 2           |
| "lcl"  | 3       | 5           | 2            | 5          | 2           |

Therefore, the final value of `cnt` is 2.
