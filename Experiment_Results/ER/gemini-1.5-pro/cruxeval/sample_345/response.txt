<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes two arguments `a` and `b` which are strings in this case. It first compares `a` and `b` using the `<` operator. Since 'ml' < 'mv' in lexicographic ordering, the condition `a < b` evaluates to `True`. Therefore, the function will execute the line `return (b, a)` which returns a tuple containing `b` and `a` in that order.
<<<Output>>>
('mv', 'ml')
