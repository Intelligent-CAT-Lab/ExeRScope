<<<Analysis>>>
1. The function `f` first checks if the input `text` is alphanumeric using `text.isalnum()`. Since an empty string does not contain any alphanumeric characters, `text.isalnum()` evaluates to `False`. 
2. Because the first condition of the `and` statement is `False`, the second condition is not evaluated. This is short-circuiting behavior.
3. Since the `if` condition evaluates to `False`, the code inside the `if` block is skipped.
4. The function then executes the `return 'string'` statement.

Therefore, the output of executing the function `f` on the input `''` is `'string'`.
