<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes a string `text` as input and returns a list `text_arr` as output. The function iterates over the input string `text` using a for loop with index `j`. In each iteration, it takes a slice of the string from the current index `j` to the end of the string, and appends this slice to the list `text_arr`.

For the input '123', the loop will iterate three times. In the first iteration, `j` is 0 and `text[j:]` is '123', which is appended to `text_arr`. In the second iteration, `j` is 1 and `text[j:]` is '23', which is appended to `text_arr`. In the third iteration, `j` is 2 and `text[j:]` is '3', which is appended to `text_arr`.

Therefore, after the loop has finished, `text_arr` will be ['123', '23', '3']. This list is then returned by the function.
<<<Output>>>
['123', '23', '3']
