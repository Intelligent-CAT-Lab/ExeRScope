<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes two inputs, `n` and `m`, and returns an array. 

1. **Initialize the array:**
   - `arr = list(range(1, n+1))`: This line creates a list `arr` containing numbers from 1 to `n`. In this case, `n` is 1, so `arr` will be initialized with `[1]`.
2. **Iterate and clear:**
   - `for i in range(m):`: This loop runs `m` times. In this case, `m` is 3, so the loop will run three times.
   - `arr.clear()`: In each iteration of the loop, the `.clear()` method removes all elements from the list `arr`. Therefore, after the first iteration `arr` will be empty (`[]`).  This process repeats for all three iterations.
3. **Return the empty array:**
   - After the loop completes, the function returns `arr`, which is now an empty list (`[]`).
