<<<Analysis>>>
1. The function `f` takes a list `nums` as input. In this case, `nums = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1]`.
2. It calculates the length of `nums` which is 5 and stores it in the variable `count`.
3. It iterates over a list generated by `[i % 2 for i in range(count)]`. This list comprehension evaluates to `[0, 1, 0, 1, 0]` as it calculates the remainder when each number from 0 to 4 (count) is divided by 2.
4. For each element `i` in the list `[0, 1, 0, 1, 0]`, the code appends the element at index `i` of `nums` to the end of `nums`. 
   - When `i = 0`, `nums[0]` which is -1 is appended to `nums`, making `nums = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1, -1]`.
   - When `i = 1`, `nums[1]` which is 0 is appended to `nums`, making `nums = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1, -1, 0]`.
   - This process continues for all values of `i`, ultimately resulting in `nums = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1, -1, 0, 0, 1, 1, -1]`. 
5. Finally, the function returns the modified `nums` list.

[-1, 0, 0, 1, 1, -1, 0, 0, 1, 1, -1]
