1. **Initialization:**
   - `a` is assigned the value "booty boot-boot bootclass".
   - `split_on` is assigned the value 'k'.
2. **Splitting the string:**
   - `t = a.split()`: This splits the string `a` into a list of words, so `t` becomes `['booty', 'boot-boot', 'bootclass']`.
3. **Iterating through words and characters:**
   - The code then iterates through each word in the `t` list.
   - For each word, it further iterates through each character in the word and appends it to the initially empty list `a`.  
     - After the loop, the list `a` would contain: `['b', 'o', 'o', 't', 'y', 'b', 'o', 'o', 't', '-', 'b', 'o', 'o', 't', 'b', 'o', 'o', 't', 'c', 'l', 'a', 's', 's']`.
4. **Checking for the presence of 'k':**
   - Finally, the code checks if the character 'k' (which is the value of `split_on`) is present in the list `a`. 
   - Since 'k' is not in the list, the function will return `False`.
