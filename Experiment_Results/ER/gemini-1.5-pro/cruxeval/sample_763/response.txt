1. The function `f` takes three arguments: `values`, `text`, and `markers`. In this case, `values` is "2Pn", `text` is "yCxpg2C2Pny2", and `markers` is an empty string "".
2. The code first calls `text.rstrip(values)`, which means it will remove any characters from the right end of the string "yCxpg2C2Pny2" that are present in the string "2Pn". Since "2" and "n" are both present at the end of "yCxpg2C2Pny2", they will be removed, resulting in the string "yCxpg2C2P".
3. Next, the code calls `.rstrip(markers)` on the result from the previous step ("yCxpg2C2P"). However, since `markers` is an empty string, this operation will not remove any characters. 
4. Therefore, the final result returned by the function will be "yCxpg2C2P".

<<<Output>>>
yCxpg2C2P
