<<<Analysis>>>
1. The function `f` takes a list of numbers `nums` as input.
2. It first iterates through the list `nums` and creates a new list containing only the positive numbers. So, for the input `[10, 3, 2, 2, 6, 0]`, the new list would be `[10, 3, 2, 2, 6]`.
3. It then checks if the length of this new list is less than or equal to 3. If it is, the function returns the new list. 
4. In this case, the length of the new list is 5, which is greater than 3, so the code proceeds to the next step.
5. The code then reverses the new list. So, the list becomes `[6, 2, 2, 3, 10]`.
6. It calculates the half of the length of the new list, which is 2 in this case.
7. It then takes the first half of the list (`[6, 2]`), concatenates it with a list of 5 zeros (`[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`), and then concatenates it with the second half of the list (`[2, 3, 10]`).
8. Therefore, the final output of the function is `[6, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 3, 10]`.
