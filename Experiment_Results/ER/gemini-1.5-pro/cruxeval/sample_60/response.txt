<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes a string `doc` as input and iterates through each character in the string. For each character `x`, it checks if it is an alphabetic character using `isalpha()`. If it is, the function returns the capitalized version of that character using `capitalize()`. If none of the characters are alphabetic, it returns '-'.

1. **Iteration 1:** The first character in the string "raruwa" is 'r'.
2. **isalpha() check:** 'r' is an alphabetic character, so `isalpha()` returns `True`.
3. **Capitalization:** The function capitalizes 'r' resulting in 'R'.
4. **Return:** The function returns 'R' and exits.

Therefore, the output of executing the function `f` on the input "raruwa" is 'R'.
<<<Output>>>
'R'
