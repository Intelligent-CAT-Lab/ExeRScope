<<<Analysis>>>
1. The function `f` takes a string `text` as input. In this case, the input is 'ax'.
2. Inside the function, `text` is converted to uppercase using `text.upper()`. So, `text` becomes 'AX'.
3. A variable `count_upper` is initialized to 0. This variable will store the count of uppercase letters.
4. The code then iterates through each `char` in the `text` string 'AX'.
5. For the first character 'A', the code checks if it is uppercase using `char.isupper()`. Since 'A' is uppercase, `count_upper` is incremented to 1.
6. The loop then moves to the next character 'X'.
7. Again, it checks if 'X' is uppercase. As 'X' is uppercase, the code continues to the next iteration without returning any value.
8. Since the text string has been fully iterated over, the loop ends.
9. Finally, the function returns `count_upper // 2`, which is 2 // 2 = 1.
