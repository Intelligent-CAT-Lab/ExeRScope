<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` aims to remove zeros from a given array while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements. 

1. **Initialization:** An empty list `a` is created to store the non-zero elements.
2. **Reversal:** The input array `array` is reversed in-place using `array.reverse()`. However, since the input is an empty list (`[]`), reversing it doesn't change anything. 
3. **Iteration and Filtering:** The code then iterates through each element of the (reversed) array. Since the array is empty, the loop doesn't run.
4. **Second Reversal:**  The list `a` (which is still empty because the loop didn't run) is reversed again. As it's empty, this operation has no effect.
5. **Return:** Finally, the function returns the list `a`, which remains empty throughout the process.

Therefore, when given an empty list as input, the function will return an empty list.
