1. We start with `s = [6, 1, 2, 3]`. The length of `s` is 4, which is greater than 1.
2. Inside the `while` loop, `s.clear()` removes all elements from the list `s`, making it empty: `s = []`.
3. `s.append(len(s))` calculates the length of the now empty list `s` (which is 0) and appends it to `s`. Now, `s = [0]`.
4. We continue in the `while` loop because the length of `s` is 1 (still greater than 1).
5. Again, `s.clear()` empties the list (`s = []`).
6. `s.append(len(s))` appends the length of the empty list (0) to `s`, resulting in `s = [0]` again.
7. The loop condition is checked. The length of `s` is 1, which is not greater than 1, so the loop ends.
8. Finally, `s.pop()` removes and returns the last element of `s`, which is 0.
