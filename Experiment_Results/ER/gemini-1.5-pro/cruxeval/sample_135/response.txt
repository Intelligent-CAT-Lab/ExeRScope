<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` first defines a dictionary `d` where the keys are country names ('Russia', 'Kazakhstan') and the values are lists of tuples. Each tuple represents a city and its corresponding country.

Next, `d.keys()` retrieves a view object containing all the keys of the dictionary `d`, which are 'Russia' and 'Kazakhstan'.

Finally, `list(d.keys())` converts this view object into a list. 

Therefore, the function `f` will return a list containing the keys of the dictionary `d`.

<<<Output>>>
['Russia', 'Kazakhstan']
