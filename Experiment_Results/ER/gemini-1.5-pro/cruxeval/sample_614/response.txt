<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` aims to find the starting index of the `occ`-th occurrence of `substr` in the `text`, starting from the rightmost occurrence.

1. **Initialization**:
   - `n = 0`: We initialize a counter `n` to keep track of the current occurrence of `substr`.
   - `while True:`: This loop continues until explicitly broken.

2. **Finding occurrences:**
   - `i = text.rfind(substr)`: We use `rfind` to find the rightmost occurrence of `'j'` in `'zjegiymjc'`, which returns `6`. 
   - `if i == -1:`: This checks if `'j'` is not found. Since `i` is 6, the loop continues.
   - `elif n == occ:`: This checks if we've found the second (i.e., `occ = 2`) occurrence of `'j'`. As `n` is currently `0`, the loop continues.
   - `else:`: This block executes:
     - `n += 1`: Increment `n` to `1`.
     - `text = text[:i]`:  Remove the portion of `text` from the last found `'j'` onwards. Now, `text` becomes `'zjeg'`.

3. **Second iteration:**
   - `i = text.rfind(substr)`: Now, `rfind` searches for `'j'` in `'zjeg'`, returning `1`.
   - `if i == -1:`:  Not executed as `i` is 1.
   - `elif n == occ:`: This time, `n` (which is `1`) equals `occ` (which is `2`).  Therefore, the function returns `i`, which is currently `1`.

Therefore, the function exits, returning `1`.
