<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes a string `code` as input. 
1. It first formats the string "148" into the first placeholder {} in the string "{}: {}".
2. Then, it encodes the string "148" using the `encode()` method. The `encode()` method encodes a string into its corresponding bytes representation. By default, it uses UTF-8 encoding. 
3. Finally, it places the bytes representation of "148" into the second placeholder {} in the string "{}: {}". 

Therefore, the output of executing the function `f` on the input "148" is "148: b'148'".

<<<Output>>>
148: b'148'
