<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` aims to extract numeric characters and specific umlaut characters (ÄäÏïÖöÜü) from a given text. Let's break down how it processes the input '':

1. `text.lower().strip()`: 
   - `''` is already lowercase and has no leading or trailing whitespace, so this step results in `''`.

2. `for ch in '':`
   - The loop iterates over each character in the string. Since the string is empty, the loop doesn't run.

3. `if ch.isnumeric() or ch in 'ÄäÏïÖöÜü':`
   - This condition is never checked because the loop doesn't iterate.

4. `new_text += ch`:
   -  This line is never reached because the loop doesn't iterate.

5. `return new_text`:
   - The function returns `new_text`, which remains an empty string (`''`) because no characters were added to it.
