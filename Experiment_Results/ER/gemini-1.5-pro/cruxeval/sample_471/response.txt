<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes two inputs: `val` which represents the character to search for and `text` which is the string to search within. Let's break down how it processes the inputs with 'o' and 'fnmart':

1. **Initialization:**
   - `val` is assigned the value 'o'.
   - `text` is assigned the value 'fnmart'.

2. **List Comprehension:**
   - The code `indices = [index for index in range(len(text)) if text[index] == val]` creates a list called `indices`.
   - It iterates through each character of 'fnmart' using `range(len(text))`.
   - For each `index` and character, it checks if the character at that `index` in 'fnmart' is equal to 'o'.
   - If the character matches 'o', the `index` is added to the `indices` list. In this case, there's no 'o' in 'fnmart', so `indices` remains empty: [].

3. **Conditional Check:**
   - `if len(indices) == 0:`: This checks if the length of the `indices` list is zero. Since `indices` is empty, the condition is True.

4. **Return Statement (if block):**
   - Since the condition is True, the code executes the `return -1` statement.

Therefore, the function will return -1.
