<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes two dictionaries as input, `original` and `string`. It aims to reverse the key-value pairs in the `string` dictionary and update this reversed mapping into the `original` dictionary.

1. **Initialization:** `temp = dict(original)` creates a copy of the `original` dictionary and assigns it to the variable `temp`. So, `temp` initially becomes `{1: -9, 0: -7}`. 

2. **Iteration:** The code then iterates through the key-value pairs of the `string` dictionary using the loop `for a, b in string.items()`. 

   - In the first iteration, `a` will be 1 (the first key in `string`) and `b` will be 2 (the value associated with key 1 in `string`). 
   - Inside the loop, `temp[b] = a` assigns the value `a` (which is 1) to the key `b` (which is 2) in the `temp` dictionary. So, `temp` becomes `{1: -9, 0: -7, 2: 1}`.

   - This process repeats for the next key-value pair in `string` (0: 3).
   - `a` will be 0 and `b` will be 3.
   - `temp[b] = a` assigns the value `a` (which is 0) to the key `b` (which is 3) in the `temp` dictionary. So, `temp` becomes `{1: -9, 0: -7, 2: 1, 3: 0}`.

3. **Return:** Finally, the function returns the `temp` dictionary.

<<<Output>>>
{1: -9, 0: -7, 2: 1, 3: 0}
