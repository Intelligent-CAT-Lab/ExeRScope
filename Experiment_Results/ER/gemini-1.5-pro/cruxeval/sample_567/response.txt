1. **Initialization:**
   - `s` is assigned the string "one two three four five".
   - `n` is assigned the integer value 3.
   - `ls` is initialized as `['one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five']` after splitting `s` by spaces.
   - `out` is initialized as an empty list: `[]`.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - **Iteration 1:**
     - `len(ls)` (5) is greater than or equal to `n` (3).
     - `out` becomes `['three', 'four', 'five']` by adding the last 3 elements of `ls`.
     - `ls` is reduced to `['one', 'two']` by removing the last 3 elements.
   - **Iteration 2:**
     - `len(ls)` (2) is not greater than or equal to `n` (3), so the loop terminates.

3. **Result:**
   - The remaining elements of `ls` (`['one', 'two']`) are concatenated with a string formed by joining the elements of `out` with underscores: `'three_four_five'`.
   - The final result is the list `['one', 'two', 'three_four_five']`.

<<<Output>>>
['one', 'two', 'three_four_five']
