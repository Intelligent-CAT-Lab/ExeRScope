<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` calculates the number of characters in the input string `s` that appear more than once.

1. **Initialization:**
   - `count = 0`: A variable `count` is initialized to 0, which will store the count of characters appearing more than once.

2. **Iteration:**
   - `for c in s:`: The code iterates over each character `c` in the input string `s`.
   - `if s.rindex(c) != s.index(c):`: For each character `c`, it checks if the first occurrence of `c` (using `s.index(c)`) is at a different position than the last occurrence of `c` (using `s.rindex(c)`). If they are different, it means the character `c` appears more than once.
   - `count += 1`: If the condition is true (character appears more than once), the `count` is incremented by 1.

3. **Return:**
   - `return count`: After iterating over all characters, the function returns the final value of `count`.

Applying this to the input "abca dea ead":

- 'a' appears multiple times, so count is incremented.
- 'b', 'c', and 'd' appear multiple times, so count is incremented for each.
- ' ', 'e' also appear multiple times, so count is incremented.

Therefore, the function will count 6 characters that appear more than once.
