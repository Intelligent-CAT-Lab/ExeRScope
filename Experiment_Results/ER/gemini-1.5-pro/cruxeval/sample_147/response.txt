<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes a list `nums` as input. It first calculates the middle index of the list by performing integer division of the length of `nums` by 2. In this case, `len(nums)` is 3, so `middle` will be `3 // 2 = 1`.

The function then returns a new list that is the concatenation of two slices of the input list:

1. `nums[middle:]`: This slice starts from the `middle` index (1 in this case) and goes to the end of the list. So, it will be `nums[1:] = [1, 1]`.
2. `nums[0:middle]`: This slice starts from the beginning of the list and goes up to, but not including, the `middle` index. So, it will be `nums[0:1] = [1]`.

Finally, the function concatenates these two slices: `[1, 1] + [1]` resulting in `[1, 1, 1]`.

<<<Output>>>
[1, 1, 1]
