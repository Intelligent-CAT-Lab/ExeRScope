<<<Analysis>>>
1. **Function Call:** The code calls the function `f` with the arguments `key='read'` and `value='Is'`.

2. **Inside the Function:**
   - A dictionary `dict_` is created with the key-value pair `'read': 'Is'`.
   - The `dict.popitem(dict_)` function is called. This function removes and returns an arbitrary key-value pair from the dictionary `dict_`.  Since there's only one item in our dictionary, it will remove and return that.

3. **Return Value:** The function returns the key-value pair that was removed from `dict_`.

<<<Output>>>
('read', 'Is')
