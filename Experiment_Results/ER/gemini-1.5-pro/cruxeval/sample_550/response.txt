<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes a list of numbers `nums` as input. It then iterates through the list using a for loop with `range(len(nums))`, which will loop through indices 0, 1, and 2 in this case.

1. **Iteration 1 (i = 0):**
   - It calculates the square of the element at index 0, which is `1**2 = 1`.
   - It then inserts this squared value (1) at index 0 in the list. Now the list becomes `[1, 1, 2, 4]`.

2. **Iteration 2 (i = 1):**
   - It calculates the square of the element at index 1, which is now `1**2 = 1`.
   - It inserts this value (1) at index 1, resulting in the list `[1, 1, 1, 2, 4]`.

3. **Iteration 3 (i = 2):**
   - It calculates the square of the element at index 2, which is `1**2 = 1`.
   - It inserts this value (1) at index 2, making the list `[1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4]`.

Finally, the function returns the modified list.

[1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4]
