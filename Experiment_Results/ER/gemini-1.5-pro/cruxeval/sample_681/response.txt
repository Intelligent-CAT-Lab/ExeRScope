<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes an array, an index `ind`, and an element `elem` as input. It aims to insert the `elem` into the array at the specified index and return the modified array.

1. **Determine the insertion index:**
   - The code uses a conditional expression to determine the final insertion index based on the value of `ind`:
     -  If `ind` is negative (`ind < 0`), it inserts at index -5 (5th element from the end).
     - If `ind` is greater than the array's length (`ind > len(array)`), it inserts at the end of the array.
     - Otherwise, it inserts at `ind + 1`.
   - In this case, `ind` is 2, which is within the bounds of the array, so the insertion index will be `2 + 1 = 3`.

2. **Insert the element:**
   - The `array.insert(index, element)` method inserts the `elem` (which is 7) at the calculated index (3) in the `array`.

3. **Return the modified array:**
   - The function returns the `array` after the insertion.

Therefore, the function will insert the element 7 at index 3 of the array [1, 5, 8, 2, 0, 3], resulting in the modified array: [1, 5, 8, 7, 2, 0, 3].

<<<Output>>>
[1, 5, 8, 7, 2, 0, 3]
