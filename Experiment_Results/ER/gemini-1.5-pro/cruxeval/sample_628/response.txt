<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes a list `nums` and an integer `delete` as input. It first removes the element `delete` from the list `nums`. Then, it returns the modified list `nums`. 

When the function is called with `f([4, 5, 3, 6, 1], 5)`, it first removes the element `5` from the list `[4, 5, 3, 6, 1]`, resulting in the list `[4, 3, 6, 1]`. 

Therefore, the output of executing the function `f([4, 5, 3, 6, 1], 5)` is `[4, 3, 6, 1]`.
<<<Output>>>
[4, 3, 6, 1]
