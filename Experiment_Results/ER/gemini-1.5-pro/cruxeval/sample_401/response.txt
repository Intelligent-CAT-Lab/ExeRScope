<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes two string arguments: `text` and `suffix`. 

1. It first checks if `suffix` is not empty and if `text` ends with `suffix`. 
2. In this case, `suffix` is 'example' and `text` is 'mathematics'. The word 'mathematics' does not end with 'example'. 
3. Therefore, the function will execute the second return statement and return the original `text`.

<<<Output>>>
'mathematics'
