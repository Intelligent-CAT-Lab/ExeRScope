<<<Analysis>>>
1. The function `f` takes a list of numbers `nums` as input.
2. It first sorts the input list `nums` in ascending order using `nums.sort()`. For the input [1], the sorted list remains [1].
3. It calculates the length of the sorted list `n = len(nums)`, which is 1 in this case.
4. It initializes an empty list `new_nums`. It then checks if the length of the list is even or odd. Since the length is odd, it appends the middle element of the sorted list to `new_nums`, resulting in `new_nums = [1]`.
5. The for loop iterates from 0 to `n//2`, which is 0 in this case. Therefore, the loop runs for one iteration.
6. In each iteration, it inserts the element at index `n-i-1` of the sorted list at the beginning of `new_nums` and appends the element at index `i` to the end of `new_nums`. However, since the loop only iterates once, this step has no effect on the final output.
7. Finally, the function returns the `new_nums` list.

Therefore, the output of the function for the input `[1]` is `[1]`.
