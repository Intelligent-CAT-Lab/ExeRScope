<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes a list `nums` and two indices `pop1` and `pop2` as input. It then performs the following steps:

1. **`nums.pop(pop1 - 1)`:** 
   - `pop1` is 2, so `pop1 - 1` is 1.
   - This removes the element at index 1 from `nums`, which is `5`. 
   - `nums` is now `[1, 2, 3, 6]`.

2. **`nums.pop(pop2 - 1)`:**
   - Remember that `nums` has been modified.
   - `pop2` is 4, so `pop2 - 1` is 3.
   - This removes the element at index 3 from `nums`, which is `6`.
   - `nums` is now `[1, 2, 3]`.

3. **`return nums`:** The function returns the modified list `nums`.

Therefore, the output of executing the function `f` on the input `[1, 5, 2, 3, 6], 2, 4` is `[1, 2, 3]`.

<<<Output>>>
[1, 2, 3]
