<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes two arguments: an array named `array` and an element named `elem`. It then performs the following steps:

1. **Count Occurrences:** `array.count(elem)` counts how many times `elem` appears in `array`. In this case, `-2` appears zero times in the array `[1, 1, 1]`.

2. **Addition:** The count from step 1 (which is 0) is then added to the value of `elem` which is `-2`.

3. **Return:** The result of the addition (0 + -2 = -2) is returned.

<<<Output>>>
-2
