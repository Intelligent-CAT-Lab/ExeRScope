<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string 'с bishop.Swift' as input. 
1. It initializes an empty string called "result".
2. Then, it iterates through each character in the input string.
3. For each character, it checks if it is alphanumeric using the 'isalnum()' method.
4. If the character is alphanumeric, it converts it to uppercase using the 'upper()' method and appends it to the "result" string. 
5. If it's not alphanumeric it skips to the next iteration.
6. Finally, after processing all characters, it returns the "result" string.
Therefore, the output of the function will be 'СBISHOPSWIFT'.
<<<Output>>>
'СBISHOPSWIFT'
