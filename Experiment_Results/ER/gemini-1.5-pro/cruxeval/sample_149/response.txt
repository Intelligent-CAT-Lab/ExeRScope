The function `f` takes a tuple of numbers and a joint string as input. It iterates through each number in the tuple. For each number, it converts it to a string and creates a dictionary where the key is the string representation of the number and the value is the joint string repeated by the length of the number. It then retrieves the key from this dictionary (which is the original string representation of the number) and appends it to the `string` variable along with the joint string. Finally, it returns the concatenated string.

Let's break down the execution step by step for the input `f((32332, 23543, 132323, 33300), ',')`:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `string = ''`: An empty string variable is initialized.

2. **Iteration 1**:
   - `num = 32332`: The first number in the tuple.
   - `dict.fromkeys(str(num), ',' * len(str(num)))`: This creates a dictionary: `{'32332': ',,,,,,'}`.
   - `.popitem()[0]`: This retrieves the key from the dictionary, which is `'32332'`.
   - `string += ... + ','`:  The string becomes `'32332,'`.

3. **Iteration 2**:
   - `num = 23543`
   - The dictionary becomes: `{'23543': ',,,,,,'}`.
   - `string` becomes: `'32332,23543,'`.

4. **Iteration 3**:
   - `num = 132323`
   - The dictionary becomes: `{'132323': ',,,,,,,'}`.
   - `string` becomes: `'32332,23543,132323,'`.

5. **Iteration 4**:
   - `num = 33300`
   - The dictionary becomes: `{'33300': ',,,,,,'}`.
   - `string` becomes: `'32332,23543,132323,33300,'`.

6. **Return**:
   - The final value of `string`, `'32332,23543,132323,33300,'`, is returned.

Therefore, the output of the function execution is `'32332,23543,132323,33300,'`.

<<<Output>>>
'32332,23543,132323,33300,'
