1. The function `f` takes three arguments: `text` which is the string to be modified, `old` which is the substring to be replaced, and `new` which is the substring to replace with.
2. First, it checks if the length of `old` is greater than 3. In this case, the length of 'va' is 2, which is not greater than 3, so the code execution proceeds to the next step.
3. Next, it checks if `old` is present in `text` and if there is no space in `text`. In this case, 'va' is present in 'avacado' but there is no space in 'avacado', so this condition is not met, and the code execution proceeds to the next step.
4. The code enters a `while` loop that continues as long as `old` is present in `text`.
5. In each iteration of the loop, it replaces all occurrences of `old` with `new`. Here, 'va' is replaced by '-' in the string 'avacado', resulting in 'a-cado'. Since 'va' is no longer present in the text, the loop terminates.
6. Finally, the modified text, which is 'a-cado', is returned by the function. 

<<<Output>>>
'a-cado'
