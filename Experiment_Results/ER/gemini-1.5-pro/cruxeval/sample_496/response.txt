The function `f` takes two arguments: `text` and `value`. 
1. It first checks if the `value` is a string using `isinstance(value, str)`. In this case, `value` is `'\\'` which is a string. So, the condition is True.
2. Since the condition is True, it calculates the count of `value` in `text` using `text.count(value)` and the count of the lowercase of `value` in `text` using  `text.count(value.lower())` and returns their sum. 
    * `text.count(value)` returns the number of times `\` appears in the string `'eftw{ьТсk_1'`, which is 1.
    * `text.count(value.lower())` returns the number of times the lowercase of  `\` which is still `\` appears in the string `'eftw{ьТсk_1'`, which is still 1.
    * Therefore the sum of these two counts would be 2
3. If the `value` was not a string, it would have executed the else part of the condition and returned the count of `value` in `text` i.e., `text.count(value)`.
Therefore, the output of executing the function `f` on the input (`'eftw{ьТсk_1'`, `'\\'`) is 2.
