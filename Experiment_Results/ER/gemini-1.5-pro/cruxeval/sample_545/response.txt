<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes a list (called `array` in the function) and returns a new list containing every other element of the input list in reverse order. Here's a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `result = []`: An empty list called `result` is created to store the output.
   - `index = 0`: An index variable is initialized to 0. This variable will be used to traverse the input list.

2. **Looping through the list:**
   - `while index < len(array)`: The code enters a loop that continues as long as the `index` is less than the length of the input list.
     - `result.append(array.pop())`: Inside the loop, the `pop()` method is called on the `array`. This method removes and returns the last element of the list. In this case, it removes the last element of `array` and appends it to the `result` list.
     - `index += 2`: The `index` is incremented by 2. This means the loop processes every other element of the input list.

3. **Returning the result:**
   - `return result`: After the loop completes (when `index` is no longer less than the length of the array), the function returns the `result` list.

**Applying this to the input `[8, 8, -4, -9, 2, 8, -1, 8]`:**

- The loop processes the elements at indices 0, 2, 4, and 6.
- The `pop()` method removes elements from the end of the list, so the elements are added to `result` in reverse order of their removal. 

Therefore, the function returns a list containing elements [8, -1, -4, 8]

<<<Output>>>
[8, -1, -4, 8]
