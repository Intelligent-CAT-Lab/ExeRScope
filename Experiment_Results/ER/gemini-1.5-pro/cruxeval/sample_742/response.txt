<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` aims to check if a string `text` consists entirely of digits. 

1. **Initialization:**
   - `b = True`: A boolean variable `b` is initialized to `True`. This variable will track if all characters encountered so far are digits.

2. **Iteration:**
   - `for x in text:`: The code iterates through each character `x` in the input string `text`.
   - `if x.isdigit():`: Inside the loop, it checks if the current character `x` is a digit using the `isdigit()` method.
     - `b = True`: If the character is a digit, `b` remains `True`.
   - `else:`:  If the character is not a digit:
     - `b = False`: The flag `b` is set to `False`, indicating that we've encountered a non-digit character.
     - `break`: The loop immediately stops iterating further as we've found a character that makes the string not entirely digits.

3. **Return:**
   - `return b`: After processing all characters (or encountering a non-digit), the function returns the value of the flag `b`.

**Applying this to the input "-1-3":**

1. `b` is initially set to `True`.
2. The first character is "-", which is not a digit. `b` is set to `False`, and the loop breaks.
3. The function returns `False`.
