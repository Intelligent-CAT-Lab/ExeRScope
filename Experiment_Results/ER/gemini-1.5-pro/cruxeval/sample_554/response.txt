<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes a list `arr` as input and returns a new list with the elements of `arr` in reversed order. 

1. **`reversed(arr)`:** This part of the code uses the `reversed()` function to get an iterator that yields the elements of the input list `[2, 0, 1, 9999, 3, -5]` in reverse order. 

2. **`list(...)`:** This part of the code takes the iterator returned by `reversed(arr)` and converts it back into a list.

Therefore, the function `f` will return a new list with the elements of the input list in reversed order: `[-5, 3, 9999, 1, 0, 2]`.
<<<Output>>>
[-5, 3, 9999, 1, 0, 2]
