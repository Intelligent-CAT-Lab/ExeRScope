<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes a dictionary `d` and a list `l` as input. 

1. **Initialization:** An empty dictionary `new_d` is created.

2. **Iteration:** The code then iterates through each element `k` in the list `l`.

3. **Checking for Key Existence:** Inside the loop, it checks if the key `k` exists in the dictionary `d` using `d.get(k)`. If the key `k` exists, `d.get(k)` will return the corresponding value, otherwise it will return `None`.

4. **Adding to New Dictionary:** If the key `k` is present in the dictionary `d` (i.e., `d.get(k)` is not `None`), the key-value pair from `d` is added to the `new_d` dictionary.

5. **Return:** Finally, the function returns a copy of the `new_d` dictionary.

Applying this to the given input: 
   - The dictionary `d` is `{"lorem ipsum" : 12, "dolor" : 23}`.
   - The list `l` is `["lorem ipsum", "dolor"]`. 
   - The code will iterate through the list `l` and for each element, it will check if that element exists as a key in the dictionary `d`. 
   - Since both "lorem ipsum" and "dolor" exist as keys in `d`, the function will add both of these key-value pairs to the `new_d` dictionary.

Therefore, the function will return a new dictionary containing the key-value pairs: `{"lorem ipsum": 12, "dolor": 23}`.

<<<Output>>>
```python
{'lorem ipsum': 12, 'dolor': 23}
```
