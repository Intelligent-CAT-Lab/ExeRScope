<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` first checks if the input string `s` consists only of alphabetic characters using `isalpha()`. If it does, it returns "yes".

In this case, the input 'Boolean' is composed only of letters, so the function will return "yes" after the first if statement evaluates to True. The other conditions in the code won't be checked.

<<<Output>>>
'yes'
