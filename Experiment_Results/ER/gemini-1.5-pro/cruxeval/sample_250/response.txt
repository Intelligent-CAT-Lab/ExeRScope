1. The function `f` takes a string `text` as input. In this case, `text = 'wlace A'`.
2. `count` is assigned the length of the `text`, which is 7.
3. The `for` loop iterates through a range of numbers starting from `-count + 1` (which is -6) up to, but not including, 0.
4. In each iteration:
    - `i` takes on the value of the current number in the loop.
    - `text` is concatenated with the character at the `i`-th index of `text`. Since `i` is negative, it indexes from the end of the string. 
    - So, in the first iteration `text` becomes 'wlace AA', in the second 'wlace AAe' and so on.
5. This process continues for all values of `i` in the loop.
6. Finally, the function returns the modified `text`.

Therefore, after the loop finishes, the value of `text` and the returned value will be: 'wlace AAecalw'.

<<<Output>>>
'wlace AAecalw'
