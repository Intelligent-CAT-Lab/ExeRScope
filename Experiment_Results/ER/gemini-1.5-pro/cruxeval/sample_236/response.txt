<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes a list of strings as input (`array`) and returns a single string. Let's analyze how it processes the input `['ac8', 'qk6', '9wg']`:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `len(array)` is 3, so the condition `len(array) == 1` is False. We move to the next line.
   - `result` is initialized as a copy of the input array: `['ac8', 'qk6', '9wg']`.
   - `i` is set to 0.

2. **Outer Loop (while i < len(array)-1):**
   - This loop iterates as long as `i` is less than 2 (length of the array - 1).

   * **Iteration 1:**
      - `i = 0`
      - **Inner Loop (for j in range(2)):** This loop runs twice for each iteration of the outer loop.
         - **j = 0:** `result[i*2]` (result[0]) is set to `array[i]` (ac8). `i` is incremented to 1.
         - **j = 1:** `result[i*2]` (result[2]) is set to `array[i]` (qk6). `i` is incremented to 2.
      - At the end of the first iteration of the outer loop, `result` is `['ac8', 'qk6', 'qk6']` and `i` is 2.

   * **Iteration 2:**
      - `i = 2`
      - The outer loop condition (i < len(array)-1) becomes False, and the loop terminates.

3. **Return:** The function finally returns the joined string from the `result` list, which is 'ac8qk6qk6'.

<<<Output>>>
'ac8qk6qk6'
