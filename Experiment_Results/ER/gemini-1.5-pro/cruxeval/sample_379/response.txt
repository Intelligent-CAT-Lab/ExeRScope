<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` iterates through the input list `nums` in reverse order, with a step of -3. In this case, the loop will iterate through the indices 4, 1.

* **Iteration 1: i = 4**
   - `nums[4]` is 1, which is not equal to 0. So, the loop continues.
* **Iteration 2: i = 1**
   - `nums[1]` is 0. 
   - The condition `nums[i] == 0` is True.
   - Inside the if statement, `nums.clear()` removes all elements from the list `nums`, making it an empty list `[]`.
   - The function then returns `False`.

Therefore, the function will return `False` after clearing the list.

<<<Output>>>
False
