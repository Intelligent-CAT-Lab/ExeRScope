<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes a dictionary `marks` as input, where keys are strings and values are integers representing marks. It aims to find the highest and lowest marks.

1. **Initialization:**
   - `highest` is set to 0, the lowest possible mark initially.
   - `lowest` is set to 100, the highest possible mark initially.

2. **Iterating through Marks:**
   - The code iterates through each value in the `marks` dictionary using `marks.values()`.
   - For each `value`:
     - **Checking for Highest:** If `value` is greater than the current `highest`, `highest` is updated to `value`.
     - **Checking for Lowest:** If `value` is less than the current `lowest`, `lowest` is updated to `value`.

3. **Returning Values:**
   - After processing all values, the function returns a tuple containing `highest` and `lowest`.

**Applying to the Input:**

Let's analyze the input `{'x': 67, 'v': 89, '': 4, 'alij': 11, 'kgfsd': 72, 'yafby': 83}`:

- Initially, `highest = 0` and `lowest = 100`.

- Iterating through the values:
  - 67 > `highest`, so `highest` becomes 67. 67 < `lowest`, so `lowest` becomes 67.
  - 89 > `highest`, so `highest` becomes 89. 89 < `lowest`, so `lowest` remains 67.
  - 4 < `lowest`, so `lowest` becomes 4.
  - 11 < `lowest`, so `lowest` remains 4.
  - 72 > `highest`, so `highest` remains 89. 72 < `lowest`, so `lowest` remains 4.
  - 83 > `highest`, so `highest` remains 89. 83 < `lowest`, so `lowest` remains 4.

- Finally, the function returns `(highest, lowest)`, which is `(89, 4)`.
