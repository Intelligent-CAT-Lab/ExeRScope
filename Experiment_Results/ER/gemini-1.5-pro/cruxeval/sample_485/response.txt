<<<Analysis>>>
1. **Split the input string:** The input string 'gsd avdropj' is split into a list of tokens: ['gsd', 'avdropj'].
2. **Check the number of tokens:** The length of the tokens list is 2.
3. **Reverse the tokens:** Since the length of the tokens list is 2, the tokens list is reversed: ['avdropj', 'gsd'].
4. **Left justify and join the tokens:**  
    - 'avdropj' is left justified within a space of 5 characters resulting in 'avdropj' itself as it's already 7 characters long.
    - 'gsd' is left justified within a space of 5 characters resulting in 'gsd  ' (3 original characters + 2 spaces).
    - The two resulting strings are joined with a space in between: 'avdropj gsd  '.
5. **Return the result:** The function returns the string 'avdropj gsd  '.
<<<Output>>>
'avdropj gsd  '
