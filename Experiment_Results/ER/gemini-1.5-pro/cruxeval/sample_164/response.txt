<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes a list `lst` as input and then performs the following steps:
1. `lst.sort()`: This sorts the input list `lst` in ascending order, modifying the original list to be `[0, 1, 3, 5, 8]`.
2. `return lst[0:3]`: This slicing operation takes elements from the sorted list starting from index 0 and going up to, but not including, index 3. This effectively returns the first 3 elements of the sorted list.

Therefore, the function sorts the input list and then returns a new list containing the first three elements of the sorted list. 

Applying this to the input `[5, 8, 1, 3, 0]`, the function would first sort the list to `[0, 1, 3, 5, 8]` and then return the first three elements, resulting in `[0, 1, 3]`.

<<<Output>>>
[0, 1, 3]
