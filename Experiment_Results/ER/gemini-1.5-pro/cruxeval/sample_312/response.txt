<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes a string `str` as input and checks if all the characters in the string are alphanumeric (letters or numbers). 
1. It calls the `isalnum()` method on the input string '777'.
2. The `isalnum()` method returns `True` since '777' contains only numeric characters, which are considered alphanumeric.
3. Since the condition in the if statement is True, the function returns the string "True".

<<<Output>>>
'True'
