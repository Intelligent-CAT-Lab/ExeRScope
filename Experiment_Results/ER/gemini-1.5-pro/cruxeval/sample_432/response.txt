<<<Analysis>>>
1. The function `f` takes two arguments: `length` and `text`.
2. Inside the function, it first checks if the length of the `text` is equal to the `length` argument.
3. In this case, the length of `'G5ogb6f,c7e.EMm'` is 15, which is not equal to -5.
4. Since the condition in the if statement is false, the code inside the if block will not be executed.
5. Instead, the function will return `False`.

<<<Output>>>
False
