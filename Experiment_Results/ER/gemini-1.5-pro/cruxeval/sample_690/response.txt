<<<Analysis>>>
1. The function `f` takes an argument `n` which is expected to be a string.
2. Inside the function, `str(n)` ensures that `n` is treated as a string. 
3. `str(n).find('.')` then checks if the string contains a decimal point ("."). If a decimal point is found, `find('.')` returns the index of the decimal point, otherwise it returns -1.
4. In this case,  `n` is "800". Since "800" does not contain a decimal, `str(n).find('.')` returns -1. 
5. As the result of step 4 is not -1, the code does not enter the `if` block and goes to the next line.
6. The `return str(n)` statement converts `n` to a string and returns it. Therefore, the function will return the string "800".

<<<Output>>>
'800'
