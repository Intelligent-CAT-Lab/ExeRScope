The function `f` takes a dictionary `dic` as input. 
1. It first calls `dic.values()`, which returns a view object that contains all values in the dictionary `dic`, which is `("a", "b", "c")`.
2. It then calls `dic.keys()`, which returns a view object that contains all keys in the dictionary `dic`, which is `(-1, 0, 1)`.
3. Then the `zip` function is used to create an iterator of tuples, where the i-th tuple contains the i-th element from each of the argument sequences or iterables, which are `dic.values()` and `dic.keys()`. In this specific case, the iterator contains `('a', -1), ('b', 0), ('c', 1)`.
4. The `dict()` constructor is used to create a new dictionary `dic2` from the iterator of tuples. Each tuple in the iterator becomes a key-value pair in the new dictionary, where the first element in each tuple is the key and the second element is the value. Therefore, the new dictionary `dic2` is `{'a': -1, 'b': 0, 'c': 1}`.
5. Finally, the function returns the new dictionary `dic2`.
Therefore, the output of executing the function `f` on the input `{-1: "a", 0: "b", 1: "c"}` is `{'a': -1, 'b': 0, 'c': 1}`.

{'a': -1, 'b': 0, 'c': 1}
