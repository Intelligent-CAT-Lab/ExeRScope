<<<Analysis>>>
1. **Initialization:**
   - The function `f` takes two arguments: `text` (the string to process) and `function` (the substring to search for).
   - A list called `cites` is initialized with a single element: the length of the substring of `text` starting after the first occurrence of `function`. 
     - In this case, `text.index("010")` returns `0`, and adding `len("010")` results in `3`.  So, we're looking at the length of the substring of "010100" starting at index 3, which is "100".
     - The length of "100" is 3.  So, `cites` is initialized as `[3]`.

2. **Iteration:**
   - The code then iterates through each character (`char`) in the input `text` ("010100").
   - For each character, it checks if it is equal to the first character of the `function` ("0" in this case).

3. **Finding Occurrences:**
   - When it finds a match ( `char == function[0]` ), it calculates the length of the remaining substring from the end of the matched `function` to the end of the `text` and appends it to the `cites` list. 
   - This will happen twice in our example:
     -  The first time, `text.index("010") + len("010")`  will be `3`. The length of the remaining substring "100" is appended to the list. 
     - The second time, `text.index("010") + len("010")` will again be `3`, and the length '3' will be appended again.

4. **Return:**
   - After processing all characters, the function returns the `cites` list.
