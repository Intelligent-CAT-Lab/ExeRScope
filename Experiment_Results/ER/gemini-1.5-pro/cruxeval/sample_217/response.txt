<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` first checks if the input string consists only of alphanumeric characters (letters and numbers) using the `isalnum()` method. 

1. **Input:** The input string `'Str zahrnuje anglo-ameriæske vasi piscina and kuca!'` contains spaces, hyphens and  non-ASCII character 'æ'.
2. **isalnum() check:** Since the string contains characters other than letters and numbers, the `isalnum()` method will return `False`. 
3. **Control Flow:** As the `if` condition is `False`, the code inside the `if` block is skipped and the function executes the `return "more than ASCII"` statement.

<<<Output>>>
'more than ASCII'
