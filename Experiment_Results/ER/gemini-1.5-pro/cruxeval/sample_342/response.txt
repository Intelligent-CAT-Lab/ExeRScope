<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes a string `text` as input and checks if the number of hyphens ('-') in the string is equal to the length of the string.

1. `text.count('-')`: This part of the code counts the number of hyphens in the input string. In this case, `---123-4` has four hyphens.
2. `len(text)`: This calculates the total length of the input string.  The length of `---123-4` is 9.
3. `... == ...`: Finally, the code compares the count of hyphens (4) with the total length of the string (9). Since they are not equal, the function will return `False`.

<<<Output>>>
False
