The function `f` takes a list (called `array`) as input and aims to generate a new list where each element is a string of 'n's repeated a number of times based on the input list. Let's break it down:

1. **`just_ns = list(map(lambda num: 'n'*num, array))`**:
   - `map(lambda num: 'n'*num, array)`: This part applies a lambda function to each element of the input `array`. The lambda function `lambda num: 'n'*num` takes a number `num` and returns a string consisting of 'n' repeated `num` times. The `map` function applies this to each number in `array` and returns a map object.
   - `list(...)`: This converts the resulting map object into a list. So, `just_ns` will be a list where each element corresponds to the result of applying the lambda function to each element in the input `array`.

2. **`final_output = []`**: An empty list called `final_output` is created.

3. **`for wipe in just_ns:`**: This loop iterates through each item (which we're calling `wipe`) in the `just_ns` list.

4. **`final_output.append(wipe)`**: Inside the loop, each `wipe` (which is a string of 'n's) is appended to the `final_output` list.

5. **`return final_output`**: Finally, the function returns the `final_output` list.

Now, in the case of `f([])`, we are passing an empty list. This means `just_ns` will also be an empty list as the lambda function won't be applied to any elements. Consequently, the loop won't run, and `final_output` will remain an empty list.
