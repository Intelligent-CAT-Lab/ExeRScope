<<<Analysis>>>
1. **Input:** The function `f` receives an empty string `""` as input.
2. **Splitting:** `text.split()` is called on the empty string, resulting in an empty list: `[]`.
3. **Empty List Check:** The code enters the `if texts:` block because the list is not empty.
4. **List Comprehension:** The list comprehension `[t for t in texts if t.isascii() and t not in ('nada', '0')]` iterates over the empty list `texts`. Since there are no elements, the resulting list `xtexts` is also empty: `[]`.
5. **Empty `xtexts` Check:** The code checks if `xtexts` is empty. Since it is empty, the `else` part of the conditional expression is executed, returning `'nada'`.

<<<Output>>>
'nada'
