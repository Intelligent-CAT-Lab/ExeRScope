1. **`f('urecord', 8)`:** The function `f` is called with the arguments `s = 'urecord'` and `l = 8`.
2. **`s.ljust(l, '=')`:**  This part uses the `ljust` method on the string `'urecord'`. It pads the string on the right with `'='` characters until it reaches a length of 8. This results in the string `'urecord='`.
3. **`.rpartition('=')`:** This method searches for the last occurrence of `'='` in the string `'urecord='` and splits the string into three parts: everything before the `'='`, the `'='` itself, and everything after the `'='`. In this case, it results in the tuple: `('urecord', '=', '')`. 
4. **`[0]`:** This selects the first element of the tuple obtained in the previous step, which is `'urecord'`.

Therefore, the function will return the string `'urecord'`.
<<<Output>>>
'urecord'
