1. The function `f` takes a string `text` as input. In this case, the input is 'qq0tt'.
2. Inside the function, `text.rpartition('0')` partitions the string 'qq0tt' into three parts from the rightmost occurrence of '0'. This results in `l = ('qq', '0', 'tt')`.
3. Next, it checks if `l[2]` is an empty string. Since `l[2]` is 'tt', which is not an empty string, it proceeds to the next step.
4. It calculates the length of `l[0]` which is 'qq' having length 2.
5. It then uses the `find()` method to locate the index of the first occurrence of '0' within `l[2]`. As 'tt' doesn't contain '0', `find()` returns -1. Adding 1 to it gives 0.
6. Finally, the function constructs a string using f-string formatting: '2:0' (length of 'qq' followed by ':' followed by the calculated value 0).
7. Therefore, the output of the function `f('qq0tt')` is '2:0'.
