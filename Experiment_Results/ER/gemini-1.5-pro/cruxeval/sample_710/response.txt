<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes a dictionary `playlist`, a string `liker_name`, and a string `song_index` as input. 

1. **Initialization:** `playlist[liker_name] = playlist.get(liker_name, [])` 
   - This line checks if the key `liker_name` ('aki' in this case) already exists in the `playlist` dictionary.
   - Since 'aki' exists as a key, it retrieves the value associated with 'aki', which is `['1', '5']`. 
   - If 'aki' didn't exist, it would assign an empty list `[]` to `playlist['aki']`.

2. **Appending:** `playlist[liker_name].append(song_index)`
   - This line appends the `song_index` ('2' in this case) to the list associated with the `liker_name` key ('aki').
   -  Therefore, the list associated with 'aki' becomes `['1', '5', '2']`.

3. **Returning:** `return playlist`
   - The function returns the modified `playlist` dictionary.

<<<Output>>>
{'aki': ['1', '5', '2']}
