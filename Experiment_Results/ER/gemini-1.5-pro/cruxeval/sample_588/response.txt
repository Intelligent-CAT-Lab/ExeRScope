<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes a list `items` and a target element `target` as input. It then checks if the `target` is present in the `items` list. 

1. **Check if target is in the list:** In this case, the target is '**' and the list is ['1', '+', '-', '**', '//', '*', '+']. Since '**' is present in the list, the condition `target in items` evaluates to `True`.

2. **Find the index of the target:** As the target is present in the list, the function proceeds to find the index of the first occurrence of the target using `items.index(target)`. The `index()` method returns the index of the first occurrence of the given element in the list. In this case, the index of '**' in the list is 3. 

3. **Return the index:** The function then returns the index `3`.
