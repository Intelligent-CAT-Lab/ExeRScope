<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes a list `items` as input and aims to extract non-digit characters from each string within the list. Let's break down its execution step-by-step with the input `['123', 'cat', 'd dee']`:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `result = []`: An empty list `result` is created to store the extracted non-digit characters.

2. **Outer Loop (Iterating through items):**
   - The outer loop iterates through each element in the `items` list.
     - **Iteration 1: `item = '123'`**
       - Inner Loop (Iterating through characters):
         - The inner loop iterates through each character (`d`) in the string `'123'`.
         - Since all characters are digits, the condition `if not d.isdigit()` evaluates to `False`, and no characters are appended to `result`.
     - **Iteration 2: `item = 'cat'`**
       - Inner Loop:
         - The inner loop iterates through characters `'c'`, `'a'`, `'t'` in the string `'cat'`.
         -  As none of these characters are digits, the condition `if not d.isdigit()` is always `True`.
         - Therefore, `'c'`, `'a'`, and `'t'` are appended to the `result` list.
     - **Iteration 3: `item = 'd dee'`**
       - Inner Loop:
         - The inner loop iterates through characters `'d'`, `' '`, `'d'`, `'e'`, `'e'` in the string `'d dee'`.
         - For characters `'d'`, `' '`, `'e'`, the condition `if not d.isdigit()` evaluates to `True`, so they are appended to `result`. 

3. **Returning the Result:**
   - After processing all strings in the `items` list, the function returns the `result` list.

Therefore, after processing all iterations, the `result` list would contain: `['c', 'a', 't', 'd', ' ', 'd', 'e', 'e']`.

<<<Output>>>
['c', 'a', 't', 'd', ' ', 'd', 'e', 'e']
