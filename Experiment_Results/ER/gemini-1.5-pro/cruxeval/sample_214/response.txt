1. The function `f` takes a string `sample` as input. In this case, the input is 'present/here/car%2Fwe'.
2. Inside the function, a variable `i` is initialized to -1.
3. The while loop iterates as long as there are '/' characters in the string `sample` after the index `i+1`.
    - In the first iteration, `sample.find('/', i+1)` would return 7 (the index of the second '/'). So, `i` is updated to 7.
    - In the second iteration, `sample.find('/', i+1)` would return -1 as there are no more '/' characters after index 7. The loop terminates.
4. Finally, `sample.rindex('/', 0, i)` is executed. This finds the rightmost occurrence of '/' in the string `sample` within the range of index 0 (inclusive) and `i` (exclusive). Since `i` is 7, it would find the '/' at index 6.
Therefore, the output of the function would be 6.
