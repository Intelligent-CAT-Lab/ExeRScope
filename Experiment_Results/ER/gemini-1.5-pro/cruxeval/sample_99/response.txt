<<<Analysis>>>
1. The function `f` takes three arguments: `text`, `sep`, and `num`. In this case, `text` is "aa+++bb", `sep` is "+", and `num` is 1.
2. Inside the function, `text.rsplit(sep, num)` is executed.  `rsplit()` splits the string `text` from the right, using `sep` as the delimiter, at most `num` times. 
   - In this case, it splits "aa+++bb" from the right using "+" as the delimiter, at most once. This results in the list `['aa+++b', 'b']`.
3. `'___'.join(...)` joins the elements of the list generated in the previous step using "___" as the separator. 
   - Therefore, the final output is "aa+++b___b".

'aa+++b___b'
