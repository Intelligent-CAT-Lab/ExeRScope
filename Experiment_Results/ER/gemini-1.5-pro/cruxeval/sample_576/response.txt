The function `f` takes an array and a constant as input. It initializes an output list with 'x' as the first element. Then it iterates through the array using indices from 1 to the length of the array. 

- For each index `i`, it checks if it's odd. 
  - If `i` is odd, it appends the element at index `i-1` of the input array multiplied by -2 to the `output` list. 
  - If `i` is even, it appends the input `const` to the `output` list.

Let's break down the execution step-by-step for the input `([1, 2, 3], -1)`:

1. `output` is initialized as `['x']`.
2. **Iteration 1:** `i = 1` (odd)
   - `output` becomes `['x', 1 * -2]` which is `['x', -2]`.
3. **Iteration 2:** `i = 2` (even)
   - `output` becomes `['x', -2, -1]`.
4. **Iteration 3:** `i = 3` (odd)
   - `output` becomes `['x', -2, -1, 3 * -2]` which is `['x', -2, -1, -6]`.

Finally, the function returns the `output` list.

['x', -2, -1, -6]
