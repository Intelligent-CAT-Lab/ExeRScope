1. The function `f` takes a string `string` as input. In this case, the input is '1::1'.
2. Inside the function, `count = string.count(':')` counts the number of occurrences of ':' in the input string. In this case, ':' appears twice, so `count` will be 2.
3. Next, `string.replace(':', '', count - 1)` replaces ':' in the input string. The third argument `count-1` specifies the maximum number of replacements to be made. Since `count-1` is 1, only the first occurrence of ':' will be replaced with an empty string. 
4. Therefore, the final output will be '1:1'.
