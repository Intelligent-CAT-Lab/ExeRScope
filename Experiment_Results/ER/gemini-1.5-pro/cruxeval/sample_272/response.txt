<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes two lists, `base_list` and `nums`, as input. Let's analyze how the code processes these lists:

1. `base_list.extend(nums)`: This line extends `base_list` by adding all the elements of `nums` to it. So, `base_list` becomes `[9, 7, 5, 3, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 0]`.

2. `res = base_list.copy()`: This line creates a copy of the modified `base_list` and assigns it to `res`. So, `res` is now also `[9, 7, 5, 3, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 0]`.

3. The `for` loop iterates through the indices of `res` in reverse order, starting from the last element of `nums` and going to the first:
    * In the first iteration, `i = -5`, `res[-5] = 2` is appended to `res`, making it `[9, 7, 5, 3, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 0, 2]`.
    * This process continues for all the elements from `nums` in reverse order.

4. Finally, the function returns the `res` list.

Therefore, after processing the inputs `[9, 7, 5, 3, 1]` and `[2, 4, 6, 8, 0]`, the function `f` will return a list containing all elements of the first list followed by all elements of the second list twice, in their original order.
<<<Output>>>
[9, 7, 5, 3, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 0]
