The function `f` takes a string `text` as input and returns a modified version of it. Let's break down how it works:

1. `len(text)`: It first calculates the length of the input string `text`. In this case, `len("the cow goes moo")` would be 15.

2. `len(text) + 1`: It adds 1 to the length, resulting in 16.

3. `text.ljust(16, "#")`: This is the core of the function. It uses the `ljust` method of the string.  `ljust` takes two arguments:
    - The first argument (16 in our case) specifies the desired minimum length of the resulting string.
    - The second argument ('#') is the character used to pad the string to reach that length. 

   In this case, it means the string "the cow goes moo" should be left-justified and padded to a length of 16 using '#' characters. Since the original string is already 15 characters long, only one '#' will be added at the end. 

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "the cow goes moo" is "the cow goes moo#".

'the cow goes moo#'
