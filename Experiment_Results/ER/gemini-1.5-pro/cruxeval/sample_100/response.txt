<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes a dictionary `d` and a list `rm` as input. It aims to remove keys from a copy of the dictionary `d` if they are present in the `rm` list.

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `res = d.copy()`: This line creates a copy of the input dictionary `d`. It's important to note that Python dictionaries don't allow duplicate keys. When defining `d` with duplicate keys `1` and `'1'`, the later values overwrite previous ones. Therefore, `res` is initialized as `{'1': 'b', 1: 'b'}`, keeping only the last assigned values for those keys.

2. **Iteration**:
   - `for k in rm:`: The code iterates through each element `k` in the list `rm` (in this case, `rm` only contains the integer `1`).

3. **Conditional Deletion**:
   - `if k in res:`: This line checks if the current key `k` from the `rm` list exists in the `res` dictionary.
   - `del res[k]`: If the key `k` is found in `res`, this line removes the key-value pair associated with `k` from the `res` dictionary.

4. **Return**:
   - `return res`:  After processing all elements in `rm`, the function returns the modified dictionary `res`.

In this specific case, since `rm` contains `1`, and the key `1` exists in `res`, the code will remove the key-value pair `1: 'b'` from `res`.

<<<Output>>>
{'1': 'b'}
