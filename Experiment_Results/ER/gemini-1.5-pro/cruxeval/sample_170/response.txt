<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes a list `nums` and a number `number` as input. It then uses the `count()` method of the list to count how many times `number` appears in `nums`. 

In this specific case, the function is called with the list `[12, 0, 13, 4, 12]` and the number `12`. The code will count how many times the number `12` appears in the list `[12, 0, 13, 4, 12]`. 

Since `12` appears twice in the list, the function will return `2`.
