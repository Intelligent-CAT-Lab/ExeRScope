<<<Analysis>>>
1. The function `f` takes a single argument, a string named `string`.
2. Inside the function, it first checks if the first four characters of the input `string` are equal to the string `'Nuva'` using slicing `string[:4]` and comparing it to `'Nuva'`.
3. In this case, the input string is `'Nuva?dlfuyjys'`, and its first four characters are indeed `'Nuva'`.
4. Since the condition `string[:4] != 'Nuva'` is False, the code enters the `else` block.
5. Inside the `else` block, the `rstrip()` method is called on the input string. This method removes any trailing whitespace characters (spaces, tabs, newlines) from the end of the string.
6. The input string `'Nuva?dlfuyjys'` has no trailing whitespace. 
7. Therefore, the `rstrip()` method doesn't remove any characters and returns the original string `'Nuva?dlfuyjys'`. 

<<<Output>>>
'Nuva?dlfuyjys'
