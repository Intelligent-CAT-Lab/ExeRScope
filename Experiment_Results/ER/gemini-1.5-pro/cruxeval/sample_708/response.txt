The function `f` takes a string as input and aims to remove trailing spaces from the string. Here's how it works step-by-step:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `l = list(string)`: The input string `'    jcmfxv     '` is converted into a list of characters: `[' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', 'j', 'c', 'm', 'f', 'x', 'v', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ']`.
   - `for i in reversed(range(len(l))):`: This loop iterates over the indices of the list in reverse order, starting from the last element and moving towards the beginning.

2. **Iterating and Removing Trailing Spaces:**
   - `if l[i] != ' ':`: Inside the loop, it checks if the character at the current index `i` is not a space.
     - If the character is not a space, it means we've encountered a non-space character from the end, indicating the end of the trailing spaces. The loop is exited using `break`.
     - If the character is a space, the code proceeds to the next step.
   - `l.pop(i)`: This line removes the character at the current index `i` from the list `l`, effectively removing a trailing space.

3. **Joining Back into a String:**
   - `return ''.join(l)`: After the loop completes, all trailing spaces have been removed from the list `l`. The remaining characters are joined back into a single string using `''.join(l)`, and this string is returned as the result.

**Applying to the Input:**

For the input `'    jcmfxv     '`, the code will iterate from the end of the list. It will keep removing spaces until it reaches the character 'v'. After that, the loop will break, leaving the leading spaces intact.

<<<Output>>>
'    jcmfxv'
