The function `f` takes a dictionary `data` as input. It iterates through the dictionary keys, and for each key, it iterates through the values associated with that key (which are lists in this case). For each value in the nested list, it checks if the value is already present in the `members` list. If not, it appends the value to the `members` list. Finally, the function returns the sorted `members` list.

Let's break down the execution step-by-step:

1. `members` is initialized as an empty list: `[]`
2. **Iteration 1: `key = 'inf'`, `value = ['a', 'b']`**
   - `'a' not in members`: `'a'` is appended to `members` -> `['a']`
   - `'b' not in members`: `'b'` is appended to `members` -> `['a', 'b']`
3. **Iteration 2: `key = 'a'`, `value = ['inf', 'c']`**
   - `'inf' not in members`: `'inf'` is appended to `members` -> `['a', 'b', 'inf']`
   - `'c' not in members`: `'c'` is appended to `members` -> `['a', 'b', 'inf', 'c']`
4. **Iteration 3: `key = 'd'`, `value = ['inf']`**
   - `'inf'` is already in `members`, so nothing is appended
5. Finally, `members` which is `['a', 'b', 'inf', 'c']` is sorted alphabetically and returned as `['a', 'b', 'c', 'inf']`

Therefore, the output of the function `f` with the given input is `['a', 'b', 'c', 'inf']`.
