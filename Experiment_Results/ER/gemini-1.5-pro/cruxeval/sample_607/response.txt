<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` checks if the input `text` ends with '.', '!', or '?'. Let's break down the execution step by step:

1. **Initialization:** 
   - The input `text` is '. C.'.
   - The loop iterates through the characters ['.', '!', '?'].

2. **Iteration 1:**
   - `i` is '.'.
   - `text.endswith('.')` evaluates to `True` because '. C.' does indeed end with a period.
   - The function immediately returns `True`.

Therefore, the function will return `True` as soon as it finds that the input ends with a period. It won't even need to check for '!' or '?'.

<<<Output>>>
True
