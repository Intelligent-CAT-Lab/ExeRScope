1. The function `f` takes two lists as input: `places` and `lazy`.
2. First, the code sorts the `places` list in ascending order: `[90, 92, 375, 564, 728, 857]`.
3. It then iterates through the `lazy` list. For each element in `lazy`, it removes it from the `places` list. In this case, `lazy` only contains `728`, so `places` becomes `[90, 92, 375, 564, 857]`.
4. Next, it checks if the length of the `places` list is equal to 1. If it is, the function returns 1. In this case, the length is not 1, so it continues.
5. The code then iterates through the `places` list with its index using `enumerate`. 
6. For each `place` at its respective index `i`, it checks if `place + 1` exists in the `places` list using the `count` method. If `count` returns 0, meaning `place + 1` is not found, the function returns `i + 1`. 
7. In our case, when the loop reaches `place = 92` at `i = 1`, the condition `places.count(92 + 1) == 0` evaluates to true, so the function returns `i + 1`, which is `2`.
