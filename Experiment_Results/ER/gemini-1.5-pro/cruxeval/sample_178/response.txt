<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes an array and an integer `n` as input. It then uses array slicing to return a new array containing all the elements from the input array starting from the index `n` to the end. 

In this specific case, the input array is `[0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2]` and `n` is 4. Therefore, the function will return a new array containing all elements from the input array starting from the element with index 4 (which is the 5th element since indexing starts at 0) to the end of the array.

Therefore, the output of the function would be a new array containing elements `[2, 2, 2]`.
<<<Output>>>
[2, 2, 2]
