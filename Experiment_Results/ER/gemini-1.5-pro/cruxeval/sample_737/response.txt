<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes a list `nums` as input. It initializes a variable `counts` to 0. It then iterates through each element `i` in `nums`. For each element, it converts it to a string using `str(i)` and checks if it's a decimal number using `isdecimal()`. If it is and `counts` is 0, it increments `counts` by 1.  The function then returns the final value of `counts`.

Let's analyze the code step-by-step with the input `[0, 6, 2, -1, -2]`:

1. **Initialization:** `counts = 0` 
2. **Iteration 1:**
   - `i = 0`: `str(0)` is '0', which is a decimal. Since `counts` is 0, it's incremented to 1.
3. **Iteration 2:**
   - `i = 6`: `str(6)` is '6', which is a decimal. However, `counts` is no longer 0, so it's not incremented.
4. **Iteration 3 - 5:**
   - The code continues to check the remaining elements, but `counts` is never incremented again because it's already 1.

Finally, the function returns the value of `counts`, which is 1.
