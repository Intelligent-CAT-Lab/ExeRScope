1. **Initialization**: The function `f` is called with the arguments `text = 'upper case'` and `repl = 'lower case'`.
2. **Creating a Translation Table**: `str.maketrans('upper case', 'lower case')` creates a translation table. This table maps lowercase characters from the first string (`'upper case'`) to the corresponding lowercase characters in the second string (`'lower case'`). Since `str.maketrans` operates on lowercase characters, the space character remains unaffected.
3. **Translation**: The `translate` method is called on the input string `'upper case'`. This method uses the translation table created in the previous step to replace characters. Each character in `'upper case'` is looked up in the translation table, and if a mapping exists, it gets replaced with the corresponding character from `'lower case'`.
4. **Output**: As a result of the translation, characters 'u', 'p', 'e', 'r', 'c', 'a', 's' in `'upper case'` are replaced with 'l', 'o', 'w', 'e', 'r', 'c', 'a', 's', respectively, resulting in the string `'lower case'`. This string is returned by the function.
