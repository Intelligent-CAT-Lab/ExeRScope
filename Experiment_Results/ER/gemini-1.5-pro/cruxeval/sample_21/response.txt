<<<Analysis>>>
1. The function `f` takes an array as input, in this case, `[1, 1, 2, 2]`.
2. `n = array.pop()`: This line removes the last element of the array (which is `2`) and assigns its value to the variable `n`. Now, `n = 2` and the array becomes `[1, 1, 2]`.
3. `array.extend([n, n])`: This line extends the array by adding `n` twice to the end. Since `n = 2`, the array becomes `[1, 1, 2, 2, 2]`.
4. Finally, the function returns the modified array `[1, 1, 2, 2, 2]`.

<<<Output>>>
[1, 1, 2, 2, 2]
