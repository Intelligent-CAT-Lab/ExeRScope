The function `f` takes a string `text` as input and returns a new string with the case of each character swapped. Let's break down how it processes the input:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `new_text = list(text)`: This line converts the input string `'dst vavf n dmv dfvm gamcu dgcvb.'` into a list of individual characters: `['d', 's', 't', ' ', 'v', 'a', 'v', 'f', ' ', 'n', ' ', 'd', 'm', 'v', ' ', 'd', 'f', 'v', 'm', ' ', 'g', 'a', 'm', 'c', 'u', ' ', 'd', 'g', 'c', 'v', 'b', '.']`. This makes each character modifiable.

2. **Iteration:**
   - The `for i in range(len(new_text)):` loop iterates through each character in the `new_text` list.

3. **Case Swapping:**
   - Inside the loop:
     - `character = new_text[i]`: It gets the character at the current index `i`.
     - `new_character = character.swapcase()`: This swaps the case of the `character` (lowercase to uppercase and vice-versa). 
     - `new_text[i] = new_character`: The original character at index `i` is replaced with the `new_character` having its case swapped.

4. **Joining Back:**
   - `return ''.join(new_text)`: After processing all characters, the list of characters is joined back into a single string. This string, now with cases swapped, is returned as the output.

Applying this to the input `'dst vavf n dmv dfvm gamcu dgcvb.'`, each character's case is swapped during the loop.

<<<Output>>>
'DST VAVF N DMV DFVM GAMCU DGCVB.'
