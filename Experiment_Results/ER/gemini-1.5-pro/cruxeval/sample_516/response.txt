<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes two arguments: a list of strings called `strings` and a string called `substr`. It aims to find all strings within `strings` that start with `substr`, sort them by length, and return the sorted list.

1. **List Comprehension:**
   - `[s for s in strings if s.startswith(substr)]`: This part generates a new list containing only the strings from `strings` that start with the `substr` "d". In this case, only the string "condor" satisfies this condition. 

2. **Sorting:**
   - `sorted(list, key=len)`:  The `sorted` function sorts the newly created list (which at this point contains only "condor"). The `key=len` argument specifies that the sorting should be based on the length of each string. Since there's only one string, the sorting doesn't change the list's order.

3. **Return:**
   - The function finally returns the sorted list, which, in this case, is a list containing only the string "condor".
