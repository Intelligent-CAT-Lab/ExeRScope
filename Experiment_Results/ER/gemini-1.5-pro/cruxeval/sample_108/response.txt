<<<Analysis>>>
1. **Input Check:** The function `f` receives the input `1`, which is an integer.
2. **`amount` Initialization:**
   - The code checks if the type of `var` (which is `1`) is a list using `type(var) == list`. Since `1` is not a list, this condition is false.
   - Therefore, `amount` is set to `0` based on the `else` part of the conditional expression. 
3. **Dictionary Check:**
   - The code proceeds to check if the type of `var` is a dictionary using `type(var) == dict`. This is also false because `1` is not a dictionary.
4. **`nonzero` Calculation:**
   - The variable `nonzero` is assigned the value of `amount` only if `amount` is greater than `0`. Since `amount` is `0`,  `nonzero` remains `0`.
5. **Return:** The function returns the value of `nonzero`, which is `0`.
