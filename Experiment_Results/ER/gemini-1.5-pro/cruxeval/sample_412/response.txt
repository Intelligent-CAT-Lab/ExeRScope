<<<Analysis>>>
1. The function `f` takes three arguments: `start`, `end`, and `interval`.
2. It first uses the `range` function to generate a sequence of numbers starting from `start`, incrementing by `interval`, and stopping at `end`. In this case, `range(3, 11, 1)` would generate the sequence `[3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`.
3. This sequence is then converted into a list called `steps`.
4. The code then checks if the number `1` is present in the `steps` list. In this case, `1` is not in the list `[3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`. 
5. Since `1` is not in the `steps` list, the conditional statement is not executed.
6. Finally, the function returns the length of the `steps` list using `len(steps)`. The length of the list `[3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]` is `8`.
