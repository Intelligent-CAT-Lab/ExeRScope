<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes a list `orig` as input and intends to modify it. Let's analyze it step-by-step with the input `[1, 2, 3]`:

1. **`copy = orig`**: This line does not actually create a copy of the list. It makes `copy` a reference to the same list object as `orig`. So any changes to `copy` will also modify `orig`. 
2. **`copy.append(100)`**: This appends the value `100` to the end of the list `copy`. Since `copy` refers to the same list as `orig`, the original list becomes `[1, 2, 3, 100]`.
3. **`orig.pop()`**: This removes the last element from the list `orig`.  The list becomes `[1, 2, 100]`
4. **`return copy`**: This returns the list `copy`, which is the same list as `orig`. 

Therefore, the function modifies the input list in-place and returns the modified list.

<<<Output>>>
[1, 2, 100]
