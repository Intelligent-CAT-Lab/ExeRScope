The function `f` processes an input string `text` and returns a new string. Here's how it works:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `new_text = []`: An empty list called `new_text` is created. This list will be used to store uppercase characters from the input string.

2. **Iterating through the input string**:
   - `for character in text:`: The code iterates through each character in the input string `text`.
     - `if character.isupper()`: For each character, it checks if it's uppercase. 
       - `new_text.insert(len(new_text) // 2, character)`: If the character is uppercase, it's inserted into the `new_text` list at the middle position. The middle position is calculated using `len(new_text) // 2`. This ensures that subsequent uppercase letters are inserted around previously inserted ones, effectively reversing their order.

3. **Handling empty `new_text`**:
   - `if len(new_text) == 0:`: After processing all characters, it checks if `new_text` is still empty, implying no uppercase letters were found in the input.
     - `new_text = ['-']`: If empty, a hyphen ('-') is added to `new_text`.

4. **Returning the result**:
   - `return ''.join(new_text)`: Finally, the function joins the elements of `new_text` (which now contains uppercase letters or a hyphen) into a single string and returns it as the result.

Applying this to the input "String matching is a big part of RexEx library.":
- The uppercase letters are 'S', 'R', 'E'.
- These are inserted into `new_text` in reverse order: 'E', then 'R' before 'E', finally 'S' before 'R'.

Therefore, the output of the function for the given input would be "ER-S".
