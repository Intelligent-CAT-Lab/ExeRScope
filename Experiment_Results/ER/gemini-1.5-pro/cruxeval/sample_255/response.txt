<<<Analysis>>>
1. The function `f` takes three arguments: `text` (a string), `fill` (a character), and `size` (an integer).
2. It first checks if the `size` is negative. If it is, it converts it to positive using `size = -size`. In this case, `size` is 1, so this line is skipped.
3. Next, it checks if the length of the `text` is greater than the `size`. In this case, the length of `text` ('no asw') is 6, which is greater than `size` (1).
4. Because the length of the text is greater than the size, it executes the code in the `if` statement: `return text[len(text) - size:]`. This takes a substring of the text starting from the index `len(text) - size` and going to the end. In this case, it would be `text[6-1:]` which is `text[5:]`. So it returns the substring starting from the 5th index (0-based indexing) of "no asw" which is "w".
