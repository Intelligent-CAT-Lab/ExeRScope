1. The function `f` takes a list `nums` and an integer `index` as input.
2. Inside the function, `nums[index]` accesses the element at the given `index`. In this case, `nums[3]` is 3.
3. Next, `nums[index] % 42` calculates the remainder when the element at the given `index` is divided by 42. In this case, 3 % 42 is 3.
4. `nums.pop(index)` removes the element at the given `index` from the list and returns its value. In this case, `nums.pop(3)` removes 3 from the list and returns it. Now the list becomes `[3, 2, 0, 7]`.
5. The popped value (3 in this case) is then multiplied by 2, resulting in 6.
6. Finally, the code adds the result from step 3 (which is 3) to the result of step 5 (which is 6), resulting in 9.
Therefore, the output of executing the function `f` on the input `[3, 2, 0, 3, 7]` and `3` is 9.
