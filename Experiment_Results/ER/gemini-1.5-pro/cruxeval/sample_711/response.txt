<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes a string called `text` as input. It then uses the `replace` method of the string to replace all occurrences of newline characters `\n` with tab characters `\t`.

Therefore, for the input `'apples\n\t\npears\n\t\nbananas'`, each `\n` will be replaced by a `\t`, resulting in the following transformation:

* `apples\n\t\npears\n\t\nbananas` becomes `apples\t\t\tpears\t\t\tbananas` 

<<<Output>>>
'apples\t\t\tpears\t\t\tbananas'
