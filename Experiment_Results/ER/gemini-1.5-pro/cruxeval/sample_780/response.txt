The function `f` takes a list of integers `ints` as input and returns a string. Here's a step-by-step analysis of how the code works:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `counts = [0] * 301`: This line creates a list called `counts` with 301 elements, all initialized to 0. This list will be used to store the frequency of each integer from 0 to 300 in the input list `ints`.

2. **Counting Frequencies**:
   - `for i in ints:`: This loop iterates through each integer `i` in the input list `ints`.
     - `counts[i] += 1`: For each integer `i`, its corresponding index in the `counts` list is incremented by 1, effectively counting the occurrences of that integer.

3. **Identifying Integers Occurring at Least Three Times**:
   - `r = []`: An empty list `r` is created to store the string representations of integers that appear at least three times in the `ints` list.
   - `for i in range(len(counts))`: This loop iterates through the `counts` list using the index `i`.
     - `if counts[i] >= 3:`: If the count at index `i` is greater than or equal to 3 (meaning the integer `i` appeared at least three times in the input list), then the string representation of `i` (`str(i)`) is appended to the list `r`.

4. **Clearing the `counts` List**:
   - `counts.clear()`:  This line clears all elements from the `counts` list. This step is not essential to producing the output but might be done for memory management or to reset the list for potential subsequent uses within a larger program.

5. **Returning the Result**:
   - `return ' '.join(r)`: The list `r`, now containing the string representations of integers occurring at least three times, is joined together into a single string with each element separated by a space. This final string is returned as the output of the function.

Applying this to the input `[2, 3, 5, 2, 4, 5, 2, 89]`, only the integer '2' appears at least three times.
