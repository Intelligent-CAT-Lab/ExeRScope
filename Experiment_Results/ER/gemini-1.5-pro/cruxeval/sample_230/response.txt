<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes a string `text` as input and returns a new string `result` which is the reverse of the alphabetical characters in `text`.

1. **Initialization**:
    - `result = ''`: An empty string `result` is initialized to store the reversed alphabetical characters.
    - `i = len(text) - 1`: An index `i` is initialized to the last index of the input string `text` (length - 1).

2. **Looping through the string**:
    - `while i >= 0:`: The code enters a while loop that continues as long as the index `i` is greater than or equal to 0.
    - `c = text[i]`: In each iteration, the character at the `i`-th index of `text` is assigned to the variable `c`.
    - `if c.isalpha()`: This condition checks if the character `c` is alphabetical. 
        - If `c` is an alphabetical character:
            - `result += c`: The character `c` is appended to the `result` string.
    - `i -= 1`: The index `i` is decremented by 1 to move to the next character towards the beginning of the string.

3. **Returning the result**:
    - `return result`: Once the loop completes (having processed all characters in `text`), the function returns the `result` string.

Therefore, for the input `'102x0zoq'`, the function will iterate through the string from right to left. It will append only the alphabetical characters ('x', 'z', 'o', 'q') to the `result` string in reverse order.

<<<Output>>>
'qozo'
