<<<Analysis>>>
1. The function `f` takes two arguments: `text` which is a string and `digit` which represents the digit to count occurances of in `text`.
2. Inside the function, `count` is assigned the number of times `digit` appears in `text` using the `count` method. In this case, '7' appears once in '7Ljnw4Lj'.
3. The function then calculates the product of the integer value of `digit` (which is 7) and `count`.
4. The product, which is 7 * 1 = 7, is returned as an integer.
<<<Output>>>
7
