<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes a list `nums` and an integer `n` as input. It then uses the `pop(n)` method on the list. This method removes the element at the specified index `n` from the list and returns that removed element.

In this specific case:

1. `nums` is the list `[-7, 3, 1, -1, -1, 0, 4]`.
2. `n` is 6, which is the index of the last element in the list (remember Python uses zero-based indexing). 

Therefore, the function will remove the element at index 6 (which is 4) and return it.
