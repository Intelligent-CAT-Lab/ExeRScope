<<<Analysis>>>
1. The function `f` takes two arguments: `text` which is a string and `c` which represents the character to be removed from the string.
2. It first converts the string `text` into a list of characters called `ls`.
3. Then it checks if character `c` is present in the  string `text`. If not, it raises a ValueError.
4. If `c` is present in the string `text`, the code finds the last occurrence (rightmost) of `c` in the string `text` using the `rindex()` method. 
5. The `pop()` method then removes the character at the index returned by `rindex()` from the list `ls`.
6. Finally, the `join()` method joins the characters in the list `ls` back into a string and returns the resulting string. 

For the input `f('uufhl', 'l')`, the character `'l'` is present in the string `'uufhl'`, so the code will remove the last occurrence of `'l'` from the string and return the resulting string, `'uufh'`.
<<<Output>>>
'uufh'
