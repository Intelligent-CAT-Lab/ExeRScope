<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes a string `row` as input and returns a tuple. 
1. `row.count('1')`: This part of the code counts the number of occurrences of the character '1' in the string `row`. In this case, '1' appears 4 times in the string "100010010". 
2. `row.count('0')`: This part counts the number of occurrences of  '0' in the string `row`. The character '0' appears 5 times in the string "100010010".
3. Finally, the function returns a tuple containing these two counts: (4, 5).
<<<Output>>>
