<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes two arguments: `text` and `chars`. 

1. **Check if `text` is empty:** In this case, `text` is "ha", which is not empty. So, the code proceeds to the next step.
2. **Execute `text.rstrip(chars)`:**  This part of the code calls the `rstrip` method on the string "ha" with an empty string '' as the argument. 
    - The `rstrip()` method returns a copy of the string with trailing characters removed. Since `chars` is an empty string, no characters are removed from 'ha'.
3. **Return the result:** The result of "ha".rstrip('') is simply "ha".

Therefore, the output of the function `f('ha', '')` is "ha".
