<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes two strings, `r` and `w`, as input. 

1. **Initialization**: It initializes an empty list called `a`.
2. **Conditional Check**: It checks if the first character of `r` is equal to the first character of `w` AND the last character of `w` is equal to the last character of `r`. 
    * In our case,  `r` is "ab" and `w` is "xy". The first characters ('a' and 'x') are different, and the last characters ('b' and 'y') are also different. Therefore, this condition is False.
3. **Else Block**: Since the condition is False, the code enters the `else` block. It appends `w` ("xy") to the list `a` and then appends `r` ("ab") to `a`.
4. **Return**: The function returns the list `a`.

<<<Output>>>
['xy', 'ab']
