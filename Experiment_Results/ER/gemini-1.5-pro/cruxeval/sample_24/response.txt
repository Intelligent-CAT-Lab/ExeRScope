<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes a list `nums` and an index `i` as input. 

1. **`nums.pop(i)`:** This line removes the element at the specified index `i` from the list `nums`. In this case, `i` is 0, so the element at index 0, which is 35, is removed from the list. 
2. **`return nums`:** The function then returns the modified list `nums`.

Therefore, after removing the element at index 0, the function will return the list without the element 35. 
<<<Output>>>
[45, 3, 61, 39, 27, 47]
