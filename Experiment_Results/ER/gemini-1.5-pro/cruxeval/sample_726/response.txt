<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes a string `text` as input and aims to count the number of whitespace characters and the total length of the string. 

1. It initializes a variable `ws` to 0, which will store the count of whitespace characters.
2. It then iterates through each character `s` in the input string `text`.
3. For each character `s`, it checks if it is a whitespace character using `s.isspace()`. If it is, the `ws` counter is incremented by 1.
4. After iterating through all characters, the function returns a tuple containing `ws` (the whitespace count) and `len(text)` (the total length of the string).

In this specific case, the input string is `"jcle oq wsnibktxpiozyxmopqkfnrfjds"`. There are 3 spaces in this string. Therefore, the function will return 3 as the whitespace count and 35 as the length of the string.

<<<Output>>>
(3, 35)
