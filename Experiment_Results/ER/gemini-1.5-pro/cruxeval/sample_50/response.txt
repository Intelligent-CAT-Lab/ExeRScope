<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes a list `lst` as input and modifies it in place:

1. `lst.clear()`: This line removes all elements from the input list `lst`. So, `lst` becomes `[]`.
2. `len(lst)`: This calculates the length of the now empty list `lst`, which is 0.
3. `len(lst) + 1`: This expression evaluates to `0 + 1 = 1`.
4. `[1] * (len(lst) + 1)`: This creates a new list containing `1` repeated `1` time, resulting in the list `[1]`.
5. `lst += [1] * (len(lst) + 1)`: This line extends the existing list `lst` (which is currently empty) by appending all elements from the newly created list `[1]`. Therefore, `lst` becomes `[1]`.
6. Finally, the function returns the modified list `lst`.

Therefore, when calling `f(['a', 'c', 'v'])`, the function will first clear the input list and then return a new list `[1]`.
