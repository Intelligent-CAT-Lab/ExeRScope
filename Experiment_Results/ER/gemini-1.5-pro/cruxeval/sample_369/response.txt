<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` aims to determine the data type of the input string `var`. Let's analyze how it processes " 99 777":

1. **isdigit() check:** " 99 777" contains spaces and therefore  `var.isdigit()` evaluates to False.

2. **replace('.', '', 1).isdigit() check:** This checks if the string represents a float. However, our string has spaces, not periods, so this also evaluates to False. 

3. **Space Count Check:**  `var.count(' ') == len(var) - 1` checks if the number of spaces is one less than the length of the string. In our case, we have 4 spaces and a total length of 8, so this condition is False.

4. **Length Check:**  `len(var) == 1` checks if the string is a single character. Our string is longer, so this is False.

5. **Default Case:** Since none of the above conditions are met, the code falls to the `else` block, returning "tuple".

<<<Output>>>
'tuple'
