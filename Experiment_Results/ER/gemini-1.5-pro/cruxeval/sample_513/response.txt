<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes a list `array` as input and modifies it in place through a series of `while` loops. Let's break down how it processes the input `[0, 2]`:

1. **First `while` loop:** This loop checks for the presence of `-1` in the array. Since `-1` is not present in `[0, 2]`, the loop is never entered, and the array remains unchanged.

2. **Second `while` loop:** This loop checks for the presence of `0` in the array. Since `0` is present at the beginning of the array, the loop is entered:
   - `array.pop()`: This removes the last element of the array, which is `2`. The array becomes `[0]`. 
   - The loop condition is checked again. Since `0` is still present, `array.pop()` is executed again, removing `0` and making the array empty (`[]`).
   - The loop ends as there is no `0` left in the array.

3. **Third `while` loop:** This loop checks for the presence of `1` in the array. Since the array is already empty, this loop is never entered.

4. **Return:** Finally, the function returns the modified array, which is currently an empty list `[]`.
