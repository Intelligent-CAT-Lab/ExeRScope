<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes a dictionary `dct` as input and returns a list of tuples, where each tuple consists of a key-value pair from the input dictionary. 

1. **Initialization:** A list `lst` is created to store the output tuples.
2. **Sorting Keys:** The `sorted(dct)` function returns a sorted list of keys from the input dictionary `dct`, which in this case will be `['a', 'b', 'c']`.
3. **Iterating through Keys:** The code then iterates through each key in the sorted list of keys. 
4. **Appending Tuples:** For each key, it creates a tuple `(key, dct[key])` and appends it to the `lst`. This tuple contains the key and its corresponding value from the input dictionary.
5. **Returning the List:** After processing all keys, the function returns the `lst`, which now contains all key-value pairs as tuples.

Therefore, for the input `{'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}`, the function will return a list of tuples: `[('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3)]`.

<<<Output>>>
[('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3)]
