1. The function `f` takes a dictionary `d` as input.
2. Inside the function:
    - `i = len(d) - 1` calculates the index of the last key in the dictionary. In this case, the dictionary has 3 elements, so `i` would be 2.
    - `key = list(d.keys())[i]` gets the last key from the dictionary.  `d.keys()` returns a view of the keys, which is converted to a list, and then the element at index `i` (which is 2) is accessed. This would be the key 'c'.
    - `d.pop(key, None)` removes the key-value pair corresponding to the `key` ('c' in this case) from the dictionary `d`. If the key is not found, it does nothing thanks to the `None` argument.
    - Finally, the function returns the `key` that was removed ('c') and the modified dictionary `d`.
3. Therefore, the function `f` effectively removes the last key-value pair from the dictionary and returns the removed key and the updated dictionary. 

Applying this to our input:
1.  The input dictionary is `{'e': 1, 'd': 2, 'c': 3}`.
2.  The last key is 'c', so it's removed along with its value.
3.  The function returns the key 'c' and the modified dictionary `{'e': 1, 'd': 2}`.

<<<Output>>>
('c', {'e': 1, 'd': 2})
