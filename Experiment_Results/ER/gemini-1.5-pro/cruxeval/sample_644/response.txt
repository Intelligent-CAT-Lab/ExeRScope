1. The function `f` takes a list `nums` and an integer `pos` as input.
2. Inside the function, a slice object `s` is initialized with `slice(None)`, which is equivalent to `[:]` and selects all elements of a sequence. 
3. The code then checks if `pos` is odd using the modulo operator (`%`). In this case, `pos` is 3, which is odd.
4. Since `pos` is odd, the slice object `s` is updated to `slice(None, -1)`, which is equivalent to `[:-1]` and selects all elements of a sequence except the last one. 
5. The code then selects a subsequence of `nums` using `nums[s]` based on the current value of `s`, which is `[:-1]`. In this case, `nums[:-1]` selects  `[6]`.
6. The selected subsequence `[6]` is reversed in-place using the `reverse()` method. Reversing `[6]` results in `[6]`.
7. Finally, the function returns the modified `nums` list, which is now `[6, 1]`.
