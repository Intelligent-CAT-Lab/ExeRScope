<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes a string `text` and a character `char` as input and returns a list `a` containing the indices of all occurrences of `char` in `text`.

1. **Initialization:**
   - `new_text` is initialized with the value of `text`, which is "rvr".
   - An empty list `a` is created.

2. **Looping through Occurrences:**
   - The `while char in new_text:` loop iterates as long as the character `char` ('r' in this case) is present in the `new_text`.
   - **First Iteration:**
     - `new_text.index('r')` returns the index of the first occurrence of 'r', which is 0.
     - 0 is appended to the list `a`.
     - `new_text` is updated by replacing the first occurrence of 'r' with an empty string, resulting in "vr".
   - **Second Iteration:**
     - `new_text.index('r')` returns the index of the first occurrence of 'r', which is 1 (in the updated `new_text`).
     - 1 is appended to the list `a`.
     - `new_text` is updated by replacing the first occurrence of 'r' with an empty string, resulting in "v".
   - Now, `char` ('r') is not present in `new_text` ("v"). So, the loop terminates.

3. **Returning the Result:**
   - The function returns the list `a`, which now contains [0, 1].

Therefore, the output of executing the function `f` on the input `f('rvr', 'r')` is [0, 1].

<<<Output>>>
[0, 1]
