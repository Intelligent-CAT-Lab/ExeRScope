<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` aims to extract numeric values from a given list, whether they are initially represented as strings or integers. Let's break down how it processes the input `[0, 6, '1', '2', 0]`:

1. **Initialization:** An empty list called `digits` is created. This list will store the extracted numeric values.

2. **Iteration:** The code then enters a `for` loop that iterates over each element (`num`) in the input list `[0, 6, '1', '2', 0]`.

3. **Type and Content Check:** For each `num`:
   - It checks if the `num` is either a string containing only numeric characters (using `isinstance(num, str) and num.isnumeric()`) or an integer (using `isinstance(num, int)`).
   - If either of these conditions is true, it means the element represents a numeric value.

4. **Appending to `digits`:**  If the `num` passes the checks in the previous step, it's appended to the `digits` list. 

5. **Converting to Integers:** After processing all elements in the input list, the `digits` list (which might contain a mix of strings and integers) is converted to a list of integers using `map(int, digits)`. This applies the `int` function to each element in `digits`.

6. **Returning the Result:** Finally, the function returns the `digits` list, which now contains only the numeric values from the input, all represented as integers.

Therefore, when the function is called with `[0, 6, '1', '2', 0]`, it will identify all elements as numeric and return a list containing those elements as integers. 

<<<Output>>>
[0, 6, 1, 2, 0]
