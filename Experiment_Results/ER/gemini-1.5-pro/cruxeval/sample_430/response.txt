<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes two lists, `arr1` and `arr2`, as input. 

1. **Initialization:** Inside the function, a new list `new_arr` is created as a copy of `arr1`. This means `new_arr` will initially hold the elements `[5, 1, 3, 7, 8]`.

2. **Extension:** The `extend()` method is called on `new_arr`, with `arr2` as its argument. This method appends all elements of `arr2` to the end of `new_arr`.

3. **Return:** Finally, the function returns the modified `new_arr`.

Therefore, the function will return a new list containing all elements of `arr1` followed by all elements of `arr2`.

<<<Output>>>
[5, 1, 3, 7, 8, '', 0, -1, []]
