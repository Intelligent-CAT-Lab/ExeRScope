<<<Analysis>>>
1. Inside the `test()` method, a `MetricsCalculator` object `mc` is created. 
2. `mc.accuracy([1, 1, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0, 1])` is called, which calculates the accuracy of the given predicted labels and true labels.
3. Inside the `accuracy()` method:
    - `self.update([1, 1, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0, 1])` is called to update the confusion matrix based on the given predicted and true labels.
    - After updating, the values will be:
        - `self.true_positives = 2` (Two cases where both predicted and true are 1)
        - `self.false_positives = 1` (One case where predicted is 1 but true is 0)
        - `self.false_negatives = 0` (No case where predicted is 0 but true is 1)
        - `self.true_negatives = 1` (One case where both predicted and true are 0)
    - `total` is calculated as 4.
    - `(self.true_positives + self.true_negatives) / total` is calculated as (2 + 1) / 4 = 0.75
4. The `accuracy()` method returns 0.75, which is then returned by the `test()` method.

<<<Output>>>
0.75
