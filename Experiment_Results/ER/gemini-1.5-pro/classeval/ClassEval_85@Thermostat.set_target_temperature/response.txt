<<<Analysis>>>
1. Inside the `test()` method, a `Thermostat` object `t` is created with `current_temperature=25`, `target_temperature=25`, and `mode='cool'`.
2. Then `t.set_target_temperature(10)` is called. This sets the `target_temperature` of the thermostat `t` to 10.
3. Finally, `t.get_target_temperature()` is called which returns the `target_temperature` of the thermostat `t`.
4. Therefore, the `test()` method will return 10. 
<<<Output>>>
10
