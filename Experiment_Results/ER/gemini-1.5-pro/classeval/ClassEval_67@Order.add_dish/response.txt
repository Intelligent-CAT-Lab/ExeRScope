<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method, an instance of the Order class is created and assigned to the variable self.order.
Then, three dishes are added to the self.order.menu list. Each dish is represented as a dictionary with "dish", "price", and "count" keys.
After that, the sales dictionary is defined, mapping each dish to its corresponding sales factor.
The crucial part is that the self.order.menu list is cleared using self.order.menu = [], effectively removing all dishes from the menu.
Finally, the self.order.add_dish({}) method is called with an empty dictionary as an argument.
Since the menu is empty, the loop inside the add_dish method will not iterate, and no dish will be added to the selected_dishes list.
Therefore, the add_dish method will return True, indicating that the operation was successful (even though no dish was actually added).
<<<Output>>>
True
