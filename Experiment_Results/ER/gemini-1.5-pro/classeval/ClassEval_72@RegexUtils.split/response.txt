<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method:
1. An instance of the RegexUtils class is created as 'ru'.
2. The ru.split() method is called with the following arguments:
    - pattern: r'\b\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}\b' (This pattern matches a phone number in the format XXX-XXX-XXXX)
    - text: "123456-7890 abiguygusu 876-286-9876 kjgufwycs 987-762-9767"
3. Inside the split() method:
    - re.split(pattern, text) is called, which splits the text by the provided pattern.
4. The re.split() function will find all occurrences of the phone number pattern in the text and split the text at those points, returning a list of strings. 

<<<Output>>>
['123456-7890 abiguygusu ', ' kjgufwycs ', '']
