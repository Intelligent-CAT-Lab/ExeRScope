<<<Analysis>>>
1. Inside the `test()` method, an instance of the `ArgumentParser` class is created and assigned to `self.parser`.
2. The `arguments` attribute of `self.parser` is then directly set to a dictionary containing two key-value pairs: "name": "John" and "age": 25.
3. The `get_argument("age")` method is called on `self.parser`. This method attempts to retrieve the value associated with the key "age" from the `arguments` dictionary.
4. Since "age" is a key in the `arguments` dictionary, the method returns the corresponding value, which is 25.

<<<Output>>>
25
