<<<Analysis>>>
Let's break down the code execution step by step:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The `test()` method starts by initializing two lists:
     - `self.files`: Contains a list of file names.
     - `self.contents`: Contains a list of strings, each corresponding to the content intended to be written into the respective files from `self.files`.
2. **File Writing**:
   - A `for` loop iterates through each file name in `self.files` along with its index using `enumerate`.
   - Inside the loop:
     - It opens each file in write mode (`'w'`) using the `with open(...)` context.
     - It writes the corresponding content from `self.contents` to the file.
3. **TextFileProcessor Instantiation**:
   - It creates an instance of the `TextFileProcessor` class, passing the first file name (`self.files[0]`, which is 'test_1.txt') to the constructor.
4. **Reading the File**:
   - It calls the `read_file()` method on the `textFileProcessor` object. This method reads the content of 'test_1.txt'.
5. **Return Values**:
   - Finally, the `test()` method returns a tuple containing:
     - `str`: The built-in string class itself.
     - `type(data)`: The type of the `data` variable, which will be `<class 'str'>` since `read_file()` returns a string.
     - `data`: The content read from 'test_1.txt', which is '123aac\n&^(*&43)'.
     - `self.contents[0]`: The first element of the `self.contents` list, which is also '123aac\n&^(*&43)'.

<<<Output>>>
(<class 'str'>, <class 'str'>, '123aac\n&^(*&43)', '123aac\n&^(*&43)')
