<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method:
1. An instance of the NLPDataProcessor class is created as self.processor.
2. A list of strings string_list is defined.
3. The process() method of the self.processor instance is called with string_list as input, and the returned value is assigned to words_list. Let's break down what happens inside the process() method:
    - It first calls the construct_stop_word_list() method to get a list of stop words, which are ['a', 'an', 'the'].
    - Then, it calls the remove_stop_words() method, passing in the string_list and the stop_word_list. This method iterates through each string in the string_list, splits it into individual words, and removes any words that are present in the stop_word_list. The modified list of words is then appended to the answer list, which is returned at the end.
4. Finally, the test() method returns a tuple containing words_list and expected_words_list.
<<<Output>>>
([['This', 'is', 'test.'], ['This', 'is', 'apple.'], ['This', 'is', 'dog.']], [['This', 'is', 'test.'], ['This', 'is', 'apple.'], ['This', 'is', 'dog.']])
