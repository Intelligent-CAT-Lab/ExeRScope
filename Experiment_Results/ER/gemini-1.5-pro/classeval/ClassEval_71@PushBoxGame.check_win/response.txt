<<<Analysis>>>
1. **Initialization:**
   - `self.game_map` is initialized with a 2D list representing the game map.
   - `self.game = PushBoxGame(self.game_map)` creates an instance of the `PushBoxGame` class, passing the game map to the constructor.

2. **Constructor (`__init__`) of `PushBoxGame`:**
   - The constructor initializes instance variables like `map`, `player_row`, `player_col`, `targets`, `boxes`, `target_count`, and `is_game_over`.
   - It calls `init_game()` to set up the game based on the provided map.

3. **`init_game()`:**
   - Iterates through the game map to locate the player's initial position ("O"), targets ("G"), and boxes ("X").
   - Updates `player_row`, `player_col`, `targets`, `boxes`, and `target_count` accordingly.

4. **`check_win()`:**
   - Initializes `box_on_target_count` to 0.
   - Iterates through each box in `self.boxes`.
   - For each box, it checks if the box's coordinates are present in the `self.targets` list. If a match is found, it increments `box_on_target_count`.
   - After checking all boxes, it compares `box_on_target_count` with `self.target_count`.
   - If both are equal, it means all boxes are on targets, so it sets `self.is_game_over` to `True`.
   - Finally, it returns the value of `self.is_game_over`.

5. **Return Value:**
   - In this specific scenario, when `check_win()` is called initially, the box is not on the target. Therefore, the function will return `False`.
