<<<Analysis>>>
1. Inside the `test()` method, a `BitStatusUtil` object is created. However, this object is not used in the subsequent code.
2. The `bit_status_util.add(0, 0)` method is called. Since `add()` is a static method, it can be called directly on the class without creating an instance.
3. Inside the `add()` method:
    - `BitStatusUtil.check([states, stat])` is called with `states = 0` and `stat = 0`.
    - Inside the `check()` method, both arguments are checked to be non-negative and even. Since 0 satisfies both conditions, no exception is raised.
    - The `add()` method then calculates the bitwise OR of `states` and `stat` (0 | 0) which results in 0.
    - The `add()` method returns the result, which is 0.

Therefore, the `test()` method will return 0.
