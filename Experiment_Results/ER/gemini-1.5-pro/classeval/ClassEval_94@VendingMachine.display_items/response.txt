<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method, a VendingMachine object is created.
Then the inventory of the vending machine is initialized with 'Coke' and 'Pizza'.
The display_items() method is called on the vendingMachine object.
Inside the display_items() method, it first checks if the inventory is empty or not. In this case, it's not empty.
Then it iterates through each item in the inventory and appends the item name, price, and quantity to the items list.
Finally it returns a string that joins each item in the items list with a newline character.
<<<Output>>>
Coke - $1.25 [0]
Pizza - $1.25 [10]
