<<<Analysis>>>
1. **Initialization:** An instance of the `CamelCaseMap` class is created and assigned to the variable `camelize_map`. At this point, the internal dictionary `_data` is empty.

2. **Setting an Item:** The line `camelize_map['first_name'] = 'John'` triggers the `__setitem__` method of the `CamelCaseMap` class.

3. **Key Conversion:** Inside `__setitem__`, the `_convert_key` method is called to transform the key `'first_name'` into camel case. 
    - The `_convert_key` method checks if the input is a string. 
    - Since 'first_name' is a string, it calls the static method `_to_camel_case`.
    - The `_to_camel_case` method splits the key by '_' into ['first', 'name'], capitalizes each part except the first, and joins them to form 'firstName'.

4. **Storing the Value:** The `__setitem__` method then stores the value 'John' associated with the key 'firstName' in the `_data` dictionary.

5. **Getting the Length:** Finally, `camelize_map.__len__()` calls the `__len__` method, which returns the length of the internal `_data` dictionary. Since we have added one item to the dictionary, its length is now 1.
