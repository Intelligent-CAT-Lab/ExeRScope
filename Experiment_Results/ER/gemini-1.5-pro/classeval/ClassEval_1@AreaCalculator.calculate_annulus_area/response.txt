1. Inside the `test()` method, an instance of the `AreaCalculator` class is created with `radius=0`: `areaCalculator = AreaCalculator(0)`.
2. The `calculate_annulus_area()` method is called on this instance with arguments `inner_radius=1` and `outer_radius=3`: `areaCalculator.calculate_annulus_area(1, 3)`.
3. Inside the `calculate_annulus_area()` method:
    - The formula `math.pi * (outer_radius ** 2 - inner_radius ** 2)` is used to calculate the area of the annulus.
    - `outer_radius ** 2` evaluates to `3 ** 2 = 9`.
    - `inner_radius ** 2` evaluates to `1 ** 2 = 1`.
    - The difference is `9 - 1 = 8`.
    - Multiplying by `math.pi` (approximately 3.14159) gives the final result.
4. The calculated area is then returned by the `calculate_annulus_area()` method and subsequently by the `test()` method.
