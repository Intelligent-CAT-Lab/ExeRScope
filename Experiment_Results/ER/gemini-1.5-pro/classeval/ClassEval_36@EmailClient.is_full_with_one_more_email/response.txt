<<<Analysis>>>
1. **Initialization:**
   - Two `EmailClient` objects are created: `sender` with a capacity of 100 and `receiver` with a capacity of 20. Both inboxes are initially empty.

2. **Calling `is_full_with_one_more_email(20)`:**
   - The code calls the `is_full_with_one_more_email` method on the `receiver` object, passing in a `size` of 20.

3. **Inside `is_full_with_one_more_email`:**
   - **`get_occupied_size()`:** This method is called to calculate the total size of emails already in the `receiver`'s inbox. Since the inbox is empty, it returns 0.
   - **Comparison:** The code then checks if `occupied_size + size` (which is 0 + 20 = 20) is greater than the `receiver`'s capacity (which is 20). The condition `20 > 20` evaluates to `False`.

4. **Return Value:**
   - The `is_full_with_one_more_email` method returns `False` because the `receiver`'s inbox is not full with the additional 20 size email.

<<<Output>>>
False
