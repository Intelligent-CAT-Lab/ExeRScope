<<<Analysis>>>
1. Inside the `test()` method, a `RegexUtils` object is created and assigned to the variable `ru`.
2. The `ru.split_sentences("Aaa. Bbbb? Ccc!")` method is called with the string "Aaa. Bbbb? Ccc!" as input.
3. Inside the `split_sentences()` method:
    - It calls `self.generate_split_sentences_pattern()` to get the regex pattern for splitting sentences. This pattern is `'[.!?][\s]{1,2}(?=[A-Z])'`.
    - Then it calls `self.split(pattern, text)` with the obtained pattern and the input text.
4. Inside the `split()` method:
    - It uses the `re.split()` function with the provided pattern and text to split the text into sentences based on the pattern.
5. The `re.split()` function identifies the delimiters ('. ', '? ', '! ') based on the pattern and splits the string into a list of sentences.
6. The resulting list of sentences is returned.
<<<Output>>>
['Aaa.', 'Bbb?', 'Ccc!']
