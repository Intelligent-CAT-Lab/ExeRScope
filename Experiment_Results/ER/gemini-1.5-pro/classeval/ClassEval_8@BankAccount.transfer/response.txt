<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method:
1. Two BankAccount objects are created, account1 and account2, with initial balances of 0.
2. The balances of account1 and account2 are then directly set to 500 and 1000 respectively.
3. account1.transfer(account2, 500) is called to transfer 500 from account1 to account2.
   - Inside the transfer() method:
     - It first tries to withdraw 500 from account1 using self.withdraw(amount).
       - The withdraw() method checks if the amount is valid and if there's enough balance.
       - If both conditions are met, it deducts the amount from the balance (account1's balance becomes 0).
     - Then, it deposits the 500 into account2 using other_account.deposit(amount).
       - The deposit() method checks if the amount is valid and then adds it to the balance (account2's balance becomes 1500).
4. Finally, account1.view_balance() and account2.view_balance() are called to get the current balances of both accounts.
5. The test() method returns a tuple containing the balances of account1 and account2.
<<<Output>>>
(0, 1500)
