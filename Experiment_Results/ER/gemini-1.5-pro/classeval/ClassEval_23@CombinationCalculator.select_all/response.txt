<<<Analysis>>>
The `test()` method first creates an instance of `CombinationCalculator` with the input list `["A", "B"]`.
Then, it calls the `select_all()` method on this instance. Let's break down what `select_all()` does:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `result` is initialized as an empty list. This list will store the final combinations.
   - A loop iterates from 1 to the length of `self.datas` (which is 2 in this case) + 1, so `i` will take values 1 and 2.

2. **Iterating through `i`:**
   - For each value of `i`, `self.select(i)` is called. This method is responsible for generating combinations of length `i`.
   - The results from `self.select(i)` are extended into the `result` list.

3. **Understanding `self.select(m)`:**
   - This method uses a recursive helper function `_select` to generate combinations.
   - `_select` essentially explores all possible combinations by iterating through the input data and choosing whether to include an element or not in each recursive call.

4. **Output:**
   - Finally, `select_all` returns the `result` list, which contains all combinations of lengths 1 and 2 for the input data.

Let's analyze the specific calls to `self.select(i)`:

   - **`self.select(1)`:** This will generate combinations of length 1, which are `["A"]` and `["B"]`.
   - **`self.select(2)`:** This will generate combinations of length 2, which is `["A", "B"]`.

Therefore, the final `result` list will contain: `[["A"], ["B"], ["A", "B"]]`.

<<<Output>>>
[['A'], ['B'], ['A', 'B']]
