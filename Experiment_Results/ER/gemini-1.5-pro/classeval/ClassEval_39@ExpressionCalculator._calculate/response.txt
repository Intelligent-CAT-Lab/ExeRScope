<<<Analysis>>>
The `Test.test()` method first creates an instance of the `ExpressionCalculator` class. Then, it calls the `_calculate` method of this instance with arguments "2", "3", and "*".

Inside the `_calculate` method:

1. It checks if the operator (`current_op`) is '+', '-', '*', '/', or '%'.
2. In this case, the operator is '*'. So, it multiplies the `Decimal` values of '2' and '3'.
3. The result of this multiplication is 6.0, which is in the form of a `Decimal` object.
4. The method returns this `Decimal` object and another `Decimal` object representing 6.0.

Therefore, the `test()` method will return a tuple containing the `Decimal` object 6.0 and another `Decimal` object representing 6.0.

<<<Output>>>
(Decimal('6.0'), Decimal('6.0'))
