<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a class `ExpressionCalculator` for evaluating mathematical expressions. The `Test.test()` method creates an instance of this class and then calls the `compare` method with the arguments "*" and "+".

Let's analyze the execution step by step:

1. **Inside `Test.test()`:**
   - An instance of `ExpressionCalculator` is created and assigned to `self.expression_calculator`.
   - The `compare` method of this instance is called with arguments "*" and "+".

2. **Inside `ExpressionCalculator.compare(cur, peek)`:**
   - `cur` is assigned the value "*".
   - `peek` is assigned the value "+".
   - Since neither `cur` nor `peek` is "%", no changes are made.
   - The method then returns the result of the comparison:
     `self.operat_priority[ord(peek) - 40] >= self.operat_priority[ord(cur) - 40]`

3. **Evaluating the comparison:**
   - `ord(peek)` returns the ASCII value of "+" which is 43.
   - `ord(cur)` returns the ASCII value of "*" which is 42.
   - Therefore, the comparison becomes:
     `self.operat_priority[43 - 40] >= self.operat_priority[42 - 40]`
     `self.operat_priority[3] >= self.operat_priority[2]`
   - Looking up these indices in the `operat_priority` list:
     `1 >= 2`
   - This comparison is **False**.

4. **Returning the result:**
   - The `compare` method returns `False`.

Therefore, the `Test.test()` method will return `False`.
