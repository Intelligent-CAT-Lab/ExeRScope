<<<Analysis>>>
The `Test.test()` method utilizes the `Lemmatization` class to remove punctuation from a given sentence. Let's break down the execution step by step:

1. **Initialization:** An instance of the `Lemmatization` class is created as `lemmatization`.

2. **Method Call:** The `remove_punctuation` method of the `lemmatization` object is called with the sentence "Is this a test? I hope it is..." as input.

3. **Inside `remove_punctuation`:**
   - The method uses the `translate` method of the input string in conjunction with `str.maketrans`. 
   - `str.maketrans('', '', string.punctuation)` creates a translation table that maps all punctuation characters to None, effectively removing them during translation.

4. **Return Value:** The `remove_punctuation` method returns the modified sentence "Is this a test I hope it is" without any punctuation.

5. **Test Result:** The `test` method receives the cleaned sentence and the expected output. It then returns both as a tuple: (`result`, `expected`).

<<<Output>>>
('Is this a test I hope it is', 'Is this a test I hope it is')
