<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method:
1. We define a customer dictionary with 'name' and 'fidelity' as keys.
2. We define a cart list of dictionaries, each dictionary representing a product with 'product', 'quantity', and 'price' as keys.
3. We create an instance of DiscountStrategy named 'order', passing the customer, cart, and DiscountStrategy.BulkItemPromo as the promotion strategy.
4. We set the expected_discount to 20.0.
5. We call the promotion method of the 'order' object, passing 'order' itself as an argument. This effectively calls DiscountStrategy.BulkItemPromo(order).
6. Inside the BulkItemPromo method:
    - We initialize discount to 0.
    - We iterate through each item in the order.cart.
    - For the first item (quantity: 20, price: 10.0), the condition item['quantity'] >= 20 is True.
    - We calculate the discount for this item: 20 * 10.0 * 0.1 = 20.0 and add it to the discount.
    - For the second item (quantity: 5), the condition is False, so we don't add any discount.
    - The method returns the total discount, which is 20.0.
7. The test() method returns a tuple containing the actual_discount (20.0) and the expected_discount (20.0).
<<<Output>>>
(20.0, 20.0)
