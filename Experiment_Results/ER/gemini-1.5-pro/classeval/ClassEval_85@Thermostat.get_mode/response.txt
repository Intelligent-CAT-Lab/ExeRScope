<<<Analysis>>>
1. Inside the `test()` method, a `Thermostat` object `t` is created with the parameters `current_temperature=20`, `target_temperature=25`, and `mode='heat'`.
2. The `get_mode()` method is then called on the `t` object.
3. The `get_mode()` method simply returns the value of the `mode` attribute of the `Thermostat` object.
4. Since the `Thermostat` object `t` was initialized with `mode='heat'`, the `get_mode()` method will return `'heat'`.
<<<Output>>>
heat
