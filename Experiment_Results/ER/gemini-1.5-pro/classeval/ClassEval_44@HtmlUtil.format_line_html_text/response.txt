<<<Analysis>>>
1. Inside the `test()` method, an instance of `HtmlUtil` is created as `htmlutil`.
2. The `format_line_html_text()` method of the `htmlutil` object is called with the HTML string `<p>Some sentence here.</p>` as input.
3. Inside `format_line_html_text()`:
    - It first checks if the input `html_text` is None or empty. If it is, it returns an empty string. However, in this case, the input is not empty, so it proceeds to the next steps.
    - A BeautifulSoup object is created with the input HTML string and the 'lxml' parser.
    - It searches for code tags (`<pre>` or `<blockquote>`) and replaces their content with `-CODE-`. Since the input HTML doesn't contain these tags, this step doesn't modify anything.
    - It searches for list tags (`<ul>` or `<ol>`) and formats list items. Since the input HTML doesn't contain these tags, this step doesn't modify anything either.
    - It searches for paragraph tags (`<p>`) and formats their content. In this case, it finds one `<p>` tag.
        - It retrieves the text content of the `<p>` tag, which is `'Some sentence here.'`.
        - It checks if the last character of the text is a punctuation mark. In this case, it is a period (`.`). Therefore, it doesn't modify the text and keeps it as `'Some sentence here.'`.
    - It extracts the text from the BeautifulSoup object, decodes HTML entities, and formats line feeds. Since the only text is `'Some sentence here.'`, this results in the final output string.
4. The `format_line_html_text()` method returns the processed string `'Some sentence here.'`.
5. The `test()` method returns the result from `format_line_html_text()`, which is `'Some sentence here.'`.

<<<Output>>>
Some sentence here.
