<<<Analysis>>>
1. **Initialization:** An instance of `MetricsCalculator` is created and assigned to the variable `mc`. This initializes the counts of true positives, false positives, false negatives, and true negatives to 0.

2. **Calling `recall()`:** The `mc.recall([1, 1, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0, 1])` method is called with predicted labels `[1, 1, 0, 1]` and true labels `[1, 0, 0, 1]`.

3. **Inside `recall()`:**
   -  The `update()` method is called to calculate the true positives, false positives, false negatives, and true negatives based on the provided predicted and true labels.
   -  After updating the counts, the recall is calculated as `true_positives / (true_positives + false_negatives)`.

4. **Inside `update()`:**
   - The code iterates through the predicted and true label lists simultaneously using `zip`.
   - For each pair:
     - If the predicted label is 1 and the true label is 1, it increments `true_positives`.
     - If the predicted label is 1 and the true label is 0, it increments `false_positives`.
     - If the predicted label is 0 and the true label is 1, it increments `false_negatives`.
     - If the predicted label is 0 and the true label is 0, it increments `true_negatives`.

5. **Calculating Recall:**
   - After processing all pairs, the `recall()` method calculates the recall value. In this case:
     - `true_positives = 2` (predicted 1, actual 1 occurs twice)
     - `false_negatives = 1` (predicted 0, actual 1 occurs once)
     - `recall = 2 / (2 + 1) = 2/3 = 0.6667` (approximately)

6. **Returning the Value:**
   - The `recall()` method returns the calculated recall value, which is approximately 0.6667.
