<<<Analysis>>>
1. Inside the `Test.test()` method, an instance of the `Statistics3` class is created, but it's not used for anything because the `median` method is static.
2. The `Statistics3.median([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8])` method is called with the input data as a list of numbers.
3. Inside the `median` method:
    - The input data is sorted using `sorted(data)`, resulting in `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]`.
    - The length of the sorted data (`n`) is calculated as 8.
    - Since `n` is even (8 % 2 == 0), the median is calculated as the average of the two middle elements.
    - The two middle elements are `sorted_data[n // 2 - 1]` which is `4` and `sorted_data[n // 2]` which is `5`.
    - The average of `4` and `5` is `(4 + 5) / 2 = 4.5`.
4. The `median` method returns the calculated median, which is `4.5`.
