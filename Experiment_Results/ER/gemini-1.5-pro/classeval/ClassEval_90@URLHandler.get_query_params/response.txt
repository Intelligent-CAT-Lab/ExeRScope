Inside the test() method, a URLHandler object is created with the URL "https://www.baidu.com/s?wd=aaa&rsv_spt=1#page".
Then, the get_query_params() method is called on this object. Let's step through how this method processes the URL:

1. It first finds the index of "?" and "#" in the URL.
   - query_start will be 24 ("https://www.baidu.com/s?wd=aaa&rsv_spt=1#page".find("?"))
   - fragment_start will be 43 ("https://www.baidu.com/s?wd=aaa&rsv_spt=1#page".find("#"))

2. Since query_start is not -1, it means there are query parameters in the URL.

3. It extracts the query string from the URL using slicing.
   - query_string will be "wd=aaa&rsv_spt=1" ("https://www.baidu.com/s?wd=aaa&rsv_spt=1#page"[25:43])

4. It initializes an empty dictionary called params to store the query parameters.

5. It splits the query_string by "&" to get individual key-value pairs.
   - param_pairs will be ["wd=aaa", "rsv_spt=1"]

6. It iterates through each key-value pair in param_pairs.
   - For the first pair "wd=aaa":
     - It splits it by "=" to get the key and value.
     - key will be "wd" and value will be "aaa"
     - It adds this key-value pair to the params dictionary: params["wd"] = "aaa"
   - For the second pair "rsv_spt=1":
     - It splits it by "=" to get the key and value.
     - key will be "rsv_spt" and value will be "1"
     - It adds this key-value pair to the params dictionary: params["rsv_spt"] = "1"

7. Finally, the method returns the params dictionary.

Therefore, the get_query_params() method will return a dictionary containing the query parameters extracted from the URL.
<<<Output>>>
{'wd': 'aaa', 'rsv_spt': '1'}
