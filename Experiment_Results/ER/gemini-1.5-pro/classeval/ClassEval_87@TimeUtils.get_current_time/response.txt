<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method, a TimeUtils object is instantiated as timeutils.
The first part of the return value calls the get_current_time() method of the timeutils object. Inside get_current_time(), a specific format ("%H:%M:%S") is defined. Then, it returns the current time formatted according to this format.
The second part of the return value directly accesses the datetime object associated with the timeutils instance and calls strftime('%H:%M:%S') on it. This essentially does the same thing as the get_current_time() method - formats the current time according to the specified format.
Therefore, both parts of the return value are expected to give the same output, which is the current time in the format "HH:MM:SS".
<<<Output>>>
