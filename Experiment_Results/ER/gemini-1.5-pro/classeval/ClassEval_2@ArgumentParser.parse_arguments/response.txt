Let's break down how the code determines the return value of `Test.test()`:

1. **Initialization:**
   - An instance of `ArgumentParser` is created and assigned to `self.parser`.
   - The command string `command_str` is set to "script --name=John".

2. **Adding Arguments:**
   - `self.parser.add_argument("name")`:  This tells the parser to expect a "name" argument (required by default, as no `required` flag is set).
   - `self.parser.add_argument("age", required=False, arg_type=int)`: This adds an optional "age" argument, which should be treated as an integer.

3. **Parsing Arguments:**
   - `self.parser.parse_arguments(command_str)` is called to process the command string. Here's a breakdown:
     - The command string is split into individual arguments: `["script", "--name=John"]`.
     - The loop iterates through the arguments (excluding "script"):
       - `"--name=John"` is processed:
         - It starts with `"--"`, so it's treated as a key-value pair.
         - The key is "name" and the value is "John".
         - Since "name" is a defined argument, it's added to the `self.arguments` dictionary.
     - No "age" argument is found in the command string.
     - The `missing_args` set is calculated by finding the difference between required arguments (`{"name", "age"}`) and arguments present in `self.arguments` (`{"name"}`). This results in `missing_args` being `{"age"}`.
     - Since `missing_args` is not empty, the function returns `False, missing_args`.

4. **Return Value:**
   - The `Test.test()` method returns the tuple `(result, missing_args)`, which is `(False, {'age'})`.

<<<Output>>>
(False, {'age'})
