<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method, an instance of the ExpressionCalculator class is created. Then, the transform() method of the ExpressionCalculator class is called with the string "2 + 3 * 4" as input. Let's break down what happens inside the transform() method:

1. **Initial Processing:**
   - The input string "2 + 3 * 4" is first stripped of any whitespace characters using `re.sub(r"\s+", "", expression)`, resulting in "2+3*4".
   - Next, it checks if the expression ends with an equal sign '=' and removes it if present. In this case, there's no '=' at the end, so the expression remains "2+3*4".
   - The expression is then converted into a list of characters: `['2', '+', '3', '*', '4']`.

2. **Handling Minus Signs:**
   - The code iterates through each character in the list.
   - If a '-' character is encountered, it checks if it's at the beginning of the expression or if the character before it is one of '+', '-', '*', '/', '(', 'E', or 'e'. 
   - If any of these conditions are true, the '-' is replaced with a '~' character. In this case, there are no '-' characters that meet these conditions, so the list remains unchanged.

3. **Final Check and Return:**
   - The code checks if the first character is '~' and if the second character is '('. If true, it would modify the expression to handle cases like "~(expression)", but this condition is not met in our case.
   - Finally, the modified list of characters is joined back into a string and returned.

2+3*4
