<<<Analysis>>>
1. Inside the `test()` method, a `ShoppingCart` object is instantiated and assigned to the variable `shoppingcart`.
2. The `add_item` method of the `shoppingcart` object is called with arguments "apple", 1, and 2, representing the item name, price, and quantity, respectively.
3. Since "apple" is not initially in the `self.items` dictionary, a new key-value pair is added to the dictionary. The key is "apple" and the value is another dictionary containing the price and quantity.
4. The `view_items` method is then called on the `shoppingcart` object. This method simply returns the `self.items` dictionary. 
5. Therefore the `test()` method will return a dictionary with the added item and its information.

<<<Output>>>
```python
{'apple': {'price': 1, 'quantity': 2}}
```
