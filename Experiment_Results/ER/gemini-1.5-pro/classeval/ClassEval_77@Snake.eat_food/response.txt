<<<Analysis>>>
We first create an instance of the Snake class called `snake` with `SCREEN_WIDTH = 100`, `SCREEN_HEIGHT = 100`, `BLOCK_SIZE = 1`, and initial `food_position = (51, 51)`.

The snake's initial length is 1, and its score is 0.

We then call the `eat_food()` method four times in a row. Each time `eat_food()` is called:

1. The snake's `length` is incremented by 1.
2. The snake's `score` is incremented by 100.
3. A new random `food_position` is generated using the `random_food_position()` method, ensuring the food doesn't spawn inside the snake's body.

Finally, the `test()` method returns four values: `snake.length`, `snake.score`, `snake.length`, and `snake.score`. Since the snake ate the food four times, its length will be 5 (initial length of 1 + 4), and its score will be 400 (4 * 100).

Therefore, the `test()` method will return `(5, 400, 5, 400)`.

<<<Output>>>
(5, 400, 5, 400)
