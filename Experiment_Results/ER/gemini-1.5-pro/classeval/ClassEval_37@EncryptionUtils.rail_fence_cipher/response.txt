<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes an instance of the `EncryptionUtils` class with the key "longkey". It then calls the `rail_fence_cipher` method on this instance with the plaintext "AbCdEfG" and the number of rails 2.

The `rail_fence_cipher` method implements the rail fence cipher encryption algorithm. It first creates a 2D list called `fence` with the dimensions of rails (2) and the length of the plaintext (7). It then iterates through the plaintext, placing each character in the `fence` list in a zigzag pattern determined by the `direction` variable.

For the given input, the `fence` list would be populated as follows:

```
[['A', '\n', 'C', '\n', 'E', '\n', 'G'],
 ['\n', 'b', '\n', 'd', '\n', 'f', '\n']]
```

Finally, the method iterates through the `fence` list and concatenates all non-newline characters into a string, which is returned as the encrypted text.

Therefore, the `rail_fence_cipher` method would return the string "ACEGBDF".
