<<<Analysis>>>
1. Inside the `test()` method, a `DataStatistics2` object is created with the list `[-111, -1, -3, 2]`. This list is converted into a NumPy array within the `DataStatistics2` constructor.
2. The `get_min()` method is called on this `DataStatistics2` object.
3. Inside `get_min()`, `np.min(self.data)` is calculated, which finds the minimum value in the NumPy array `self.data`.
4. The minimum value, -111, is returned by `get_min()` and then by `test()`.

<<<Output>>>
-111
