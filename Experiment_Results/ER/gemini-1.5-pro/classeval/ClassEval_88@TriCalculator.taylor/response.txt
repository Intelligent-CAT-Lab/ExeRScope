Inside the test() method, a TriCalculator object is created and then the taylor method of the TriCalculator object is called with arguments 90 and 50. 

Inside the taylor() method:
- First, the input angle x is converted from degrees to radians by multiplying by pi/180. So, x becomes pi/2.
- The variable 'a' is initialized to 1, which will store the result of the Taylor series.
- The variable 'count' is initialized to 1, which will be used to alternate the signs in the Taylor series.
- The for loop iterates from k = 1 to n-1 (49 in this case), calculating each term of the Taylor series.
- Inside the loop:
    - If 'count' is odd, the term (x**(2*k))/factorial(2*k) is subtracted from 'a'.
    - If 'count' is even, the term (x**(2*k))/factorial(2*k) is added to 'a'.
    - 'count' is incremented by 1 in each iteration.
- Finally, the value of 'a', which represents the approximate value of cos(90) calculated using the Taylor series, is returned.

Since the Taylor series for cos(x) converges to 0 as x approaches pi/2, and we are using 50 terms in the series, the final value of 'a' will be very close to 0.
