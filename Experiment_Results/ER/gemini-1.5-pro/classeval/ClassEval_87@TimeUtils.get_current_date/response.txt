<<<Analysis>>>
The test() method in the Test class does the following:

1. **Creates a TimeUtils object:**
   - `timeutils = TimeUtils()`: This initializes a new `TimeUtils` object. During this initialization:
     - The `__init__` method of `TimeUtils` is called.
     - Inside `__init__`, `self.datetime` is set to the current datetime obtained using `datetime.datetime.now()`.

2. **Gets current date in two ways:**
   - `timeutils.get_current_date()`: 
     - This calls the `get_current_date` method of the `timeutils` object.
     - Inside `get_current_date`, the date part of `self.datetime` (which holds the current datetime) is formatted as "YYYY-MM-DD" and returned.
   - `timeutils.datetime.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')`:
     - This directly accesses the `datetime` attribute of the `timeutils` object (which is a `datetime` object).
     - It then uses `strftime('%Y-%m-%d')` to format the date part of that `datetime` object as "YYYY-MM-DD".

3. **Returns a tuple:**
   - The values returned by the two date formatting calls are combined into a tuple: `(formatted_date_from_get_current_date, formatted_date_from_strftime)`.

Therefore, the `test()` method will return a tuple containing the current date in the format "YYYY-MM-DD" twice. Both elements of the tuple will be the same since they are derived from the same `datetime` object.
