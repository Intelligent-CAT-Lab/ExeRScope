<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method:
1. It initializes a 'customer' dictionary with name and fidelity points.
2. It initializes a 'cart' list containing dictionaries, each representing a product with its quantity and price.
3. It creates an 'order' object using the DiscountStrategy class, passing the 'customer' and 'cart'.
4. It sets an 'expected_total' variable to 150.0 (which is the sum of prices * quantities in the cart).
5. It calls the 'total()' method on the 'order' object and stores the result in 'actual_total'.
6. The 'total()' method calculates the total price by iterating through each item in the cart, multiplying the item's price by its quantity, and summing up these values.
7. Finally, the 'test()' method returns a tuple containing 'actual_total' and 'expected_total'.
<<<Output>>>
(150.0, 150.0)
