<<<Analysis>>>
1. Inside the test() method, a Thermostat object 't' is created with:
    - current_temperature = 20
    - target_temperature = 25
    - mode = 'heat'
2. Then, the method set_mode('cool') is called on the 't' object. 
3. Inside the set_mode() method:
    - It checks if the given mode ('cool' in this case) is one of 'heat' or 'cool'.
    - Since 'cool' is a valid mode, it sets the thermostat's mode to 'cool'.
4. Finally, the test() method calls t.get_mode(), which simply returns the current mode of the thermostat.

Therefore, the return value of t.get_mode() would be 'cool'.
<<<Output>>>
cool
