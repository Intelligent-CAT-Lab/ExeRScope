<<<Analysis>>>
1. Inside the `test()` method, an instance of the `AssessmentSystem` class is created named `assessment_system`.
2. The `students` attribute of the `assessment_system` object is assigned a dictionary containing information for a student named 'Alice'.
3. The `get_gpa()` method is called on the `assessment_system` object with the argument 'Bob'.
4. Inside the `get_gpa()` method, it first checks if 'Bob' exists as a key in the `self.students` dictionary. Since 'Bob' is not present, the method returns `None`.

<<<Output>>>
None
