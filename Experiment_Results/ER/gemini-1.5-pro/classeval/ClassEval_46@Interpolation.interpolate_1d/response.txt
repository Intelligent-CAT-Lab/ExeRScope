<<<Analysis>>>
The test() method creates an instance of the Interpolation class and then calls the interpolate_1d() method with the following arguments:
- x = [1, 6, 4]
- y = [1, 7, 5]
- x_interp = [2, 3]

The interpolate_1d() method iterates through each value in x_interp and finds the corresponding interval in x. Then it applies linear interpolation to estimate the corresponding y value.

For xi = 2:
1 <= 2 <= 6, so i = 0
yi = 1 + (7 - 1) * (2 - 1) / (6 - 1) = 2.2
y_interp = [2.2]

For xi = 3:
1 <= 3 <= 6, so i = 0
yi = 1 + (7 - 1) * (3 - 1) / (6 - 1) = 3.4
y_interp = [2.2, 3.4]

The method returns y_interp, which contains the interpolated values.
<<<Output>>>
[2.2, 3.4]
