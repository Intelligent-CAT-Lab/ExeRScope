<<<Analysis>>>
Let's break down how the code determines the return value:

1. **Initialization:**
   - A `CalendarUtil` object is created.
   - The `events` list is initialized with a single event scheduled for January 2nd, 2023, from 1:00 AM to 2:00 AM.

2. **Calling `get_available_slots`:**
   - The code calls the `get_available_slots` method with the date January 1st, 2023.

3. **Inside `get_available_slots`:**
   - `start_time` is set to midnight (00:00) on January 1st, 2023.
   - `end_time` is set to 11:59 PM on January 1st, 2023.
   - The `while` loop iterates through each hour slot within this range.
   - For each slot, `is_available` is called to check if there's a conflict with any existing events.
   - Since the only event is on January 2nd, all slots on January 1st are considered available.
   - Each available slot (start and end time of the hour) is appended to the `available_slots` list.

4. **Return Value:**
   - The `get_available_slots` method returns the `available_slots` list.
   - The length of this list, representing the number of available hour slots on January 1st, is 24.
