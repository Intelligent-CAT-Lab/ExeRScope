<<<Analysis>>>
1. **Initialization**: A `Classroom` object is created with `id=1`. An existing course ('math', 09:00-10:00) is added to the classroom's courses list.
2. **Test Setup**: A new course ('SE', 14:30-15:30) is defined.
3. **Conflict Check**: The `check_course_conflict` method is called with the new course as input.
4. **Time Comparison**: The method iterates through each existing course in the classroom:
   - It converts the start and end times of both the new course and the existing course from strings to datetime objects for comparison.
   - For the existing 'math' course, it compares the time slots and finds no overlap with the new course's time slot.
   - Since there's no time conflict with the existing course, the `flag` variable remains True.
5. **Return Value**: The method returns `True`, indicating that there's no conflict between the new course and the existing courses.
