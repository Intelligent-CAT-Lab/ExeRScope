<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method:
1. An instance of the 'RegexUtils' class is created as 'ru'.
2. The 'ru.sub()' method is called with the following arguments:
    - pattern: r'\b\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}\b' (This is a regular expression pattern to match phone numbers in the format XXX-XXX-XXXX)
    - replacement: 'phone num' (This is the string that will replace any matched phone numbers)
    - text: "1234567890 abiguygusu 8762869876 kjgufwycs 9877629767" (This is the input string on which the substitution will be performed)
3. The 'sub()' method, in turn, calls the 're.sub()' function (from Python's re module) with the same pattern, replacement, and text.
4. The 're.sub()' function finds all occurrences of the phone number pattern in the text and replaces them with 'phone num'.
5. The modified string is then returned by the 're.sub()' function and subsequently by the 'ru.sub()' method.

Therefore, the 'test()' method will return the input string with all occurrences of phone numbers replaced by 'phone num'.
<<<Output>>>
1234567890 abiguygusu phone num kjgufwycs phone num
