<<<Analysis>>>
1. Inside the `Test.test()` method, a `TriCalculator` object is created.
2. The `cos(0)` method of the `tricalculator` object is called.
3. Inside the `cos()` method:
    - It calls the `taylor(0, 50)` method to calculate the cosine value using the Taylor series approximation.
4. Inside the `taylor(0, 50)` method:
    - `x` is converted to radians: `0 / 180 * pi = 0`.
    - The loop runs 49 times (from 1 to 49), but since `x` is 0, all the calculations inside the loop result in 0.
    - The method returns `a`, which remains 1.
5. The `cos()` method rounds the result to 10 decimal places, which doesn't change the value as it's already 1.0.
6. Finally, the `cos()` method returns 1.0, which is the return value of `Test.test()`.
