<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method:
1. It first defines the file path as "test_example.docx" and creates a DocFileHandler object.
2. Then it creates a Document object and adds a paragraph "aaa\nbbb" to it and saves it to the file path.
3. It calls the `read_text()` method of the DocFileHandler object, which reads the content from the document and returns a string "aaa\nbbb".
4. Finally it defines the expected content as "aaa\nbbb" and compares it with the value returned from the `read_text()` method.
5. It removes the "test_example.docx" file.
6. It returns the text content from  "test_example.docx" and the expected content.
<<<Output>>>
('aaa\nbbb', 'aaa\nbbb')
