<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a class `EightPuzzle` for solving the classic 8-puzzle problem. The `test` method in the `Test` class is designed to test the `move` method of the `EightPuzzle` class. Let's break down how the code works step by step:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `self.initial_state = [[2, 3, 4], [5, 0, 1], [6, 8, 7]]`: Sets the initial state of the 8-puzzle grid.
   - `self.eightPuzzle = EightPuzzle(self.initial_state)`: Creates an instance of the `EightPuzzle` class with the given initial state.

2. **Moving the Blank Tile:**
   - `result = self.eightPuzzle.move(self.initial_state, 'left')`: Calls the `move` method of the `eightPuzzle` object to move the blank tile (represented by 0) to the left.

3. **Inside the `move` Method:**
   - `i, j = self.find_blank(state)`: Finds the row and column indices (i, j) of the blank tile in the given state. In this case, the blank tile is at (1, 1).
   - `new_state = [row[:] for row in state]`: Creates a deep copy of the current state to avoid modifying the original state.
   - `new_state[i][j], new_state[i][j - 1] = new_state[i][j - 1], new_state[i][j]`:  Since the move is 'left', it swaps the blank tile with the tile to its left. After this operation, the blank tile will be at (1, 0).
   - `return new_state`: Returns the new state after the move.

4. **Expected Result:**
   - `expected = [[2, 3, 4], [0, 5, 1], [6, 8, 7]]`: Defines the expected state of the puzzle after moving the blank tile to the left.

5. **Return Values:**
   - The `test` method returns two values:
     - `result`: The new state of the puzzle after the move.
     - `expected`: The expected state of the puzzle.

Therefore, the `Test.test()` method will return the following:
 `([[2, 3, 4], [0, 5, 1], [6, 8, 7]], [[2, 3, 4], [0, 5, 1], [6, 8, 7]])`

<<<Output>>>
([[2, 3, 4], [0, 5, 1], [6, 8, 7]], [[2, 3, 4], [0, 5, 1], [6, 8, 7]])
