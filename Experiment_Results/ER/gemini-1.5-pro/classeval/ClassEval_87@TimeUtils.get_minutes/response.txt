1. The `test()` method first creates an instance of the `TimeUtils` class.
2. It then calls the `get_minutes()` method of this instance with two string arguments: '2001-7-18 1:1:1' and '2001-7-18 5:1:1'.
3. Inside `get_minutes()`:
    -  `string_to_datetime()` converts the two string timestamps into datetime objects.
    - The difference between the two datetime objects is calculated (`time2 - time1`), resulting in a timedelta object representing the time difference.
    - The total seconds in the timedelta object are accessed using `.seconds`.
    - The result is divided by 60 to convert seconds to minutes.
    - `round()` rounds the result to the nearest integer.
4. The rounded number of minutes is then returned by `get_minutes()` and subsequently by `test()`.

Since the difference between '2001-7-18 1:1:1' and '2001-7-18 5:1:1' is 4 hours, which is 240 minutes, the function will return:

<<<Output>>>
240
