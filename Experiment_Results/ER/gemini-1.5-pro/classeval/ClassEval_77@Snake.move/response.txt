<<<Analysis>>>
1. **Initialization:**
   - A `Snake` object is created with `SCREEN_WIDTH=100`, `SCREEN_HEIGHT=100`, `BLOCK_SIZE=1`, and `food_position=(51, 51)`.
   - The snake starts with `length=1`, at the center of the screen: `positions=[(50, 50)]`, and `score=0`.

2. **Calling `move((0, 0))`:**
   - The snake is instructed to move in the direction (0, 0), which means no movement.

3. **Inside the `move` method:**
   - `cur` is set to the snake's head position: (50, 50).
   - `new` is calculated, which, due to no movement, remains the same as `cur`: (50, 50).
   - The `if new == self.food_position:` condition is not met since the snake's head is not at the food's position.
   - The `if len(self.positions) > 2 and new in self.positions[2:]:` condition is also not met because the snake's length is only 1.
   - Therefore, the `else` block is executed:
     - `(50, 50)` is inserted at the beginning of `positions`.
     - Since `len(self.positions)` is now 2 (greater than `length`), the last element of `positions` is removed, making it `[(50, 50)]` again.

4. **Return Values:**
   - After the `move` call, the snake's `length` remains 1, the head position `positions[0]` remains (50, 50), and the `score` remains 0.

<<<Output>>>
(1, (50, 50), 0)
