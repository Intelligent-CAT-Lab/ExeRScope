1. **Initialization:**
   - The `test()` method starts by creating a dictionary `num_dict` containing two key-value pairs: `{'key1': 0.2, 'key2': 0.5}`.
   - It then calls the `compute_idf_weight_dict()` method of the `VectorUtil` class, passing in `2` (representing the total number of documents) and `num_dict`.

2. **Inside `compute_idf_weight_dict()`:**
   - Two empty dictionaries are initialized: `index_2_key_map` and `result`.
   - An index variable `index` is initialized to 0.
   - An empty list `count_list` is created.

3. **Iterating through `number_dict`:**
   - The code then iterates through the items (key-value pairs) of the `number_dict`.
   - For each key-value pair:
     - The key is stored in the `index_2_key_map` dictionary at the current `index`.
     - The value (count) is appended to the `count_list`.
     - The `index` is incremented by 1.

4. **Calculating IDF Weights:**
   - The `count_list` is converted into a NumPy array `a`.
   - The IDF formula is applied to each element of `a`: `np.log((total_num + 1) / (a + 1))`. This calculates the inverse document frequency (IDF) for each key, smoothed to avoid division by zero.
   - The result is stored back in `a`.

5. **Populating `result` Dictionary:**
   - The code iterates through `a`, which now contains the calculated IDF weights.
   - For each index and weight `w` in `a`:
     - The corresponding key is retrieved from `index_2_key_map` using the index.
     - The weight `w` is stored in the `result` dictionary with the retrieved key.

6. **Returning from `compute_idf_weight_dict()`:**
   - The `result` dictionary, containing the calculated IDF weights for each key, is returned.

7. **Returning from `test()`:**
   - The `test()` method then returns a tuple containing the IDF weights for 'key1' and 'key2' from the `res` dictionary.
