<<<Analysis>>>
Let's break down the execution of the `Test.test()` method step by step:

1. **Initialization:**
   - A list `self.data` is created, containing numbers from 1 to 10.
   - `self.page_size` is set to 3, indicating that each page should contain 3 items.
   - An instance of `PageUtil` is created as `self.page_util`, passing in the data and page size.

2. **PageUtil Initialization:**
   - The `PageUtil` constructor initializes its own attributes:
     - `self.data`: Stores the provided data list.
     - `self.page_size`: Stores the provided page size.
     - `self.total_items`: Calculates the total number of items in the data (10 in this case).
     - `self.total_pages`: Calculates the total number of pages required based on the data size and page size (4 in this case).

3. **Invalid Page Request:**
   - `invalid_page_number` is set to 0.
   - An empty list `empty_page` is created.
   - `self.page_util.get_page(invalid_page_number)` is called, attempting to retrieve page 0.

4. **get_page Method:**
   - Inside `get_page`, the condition `page_number < 1` evaluates to `True` (since `invalid_page_number` is 0).
   - Therefore, the method returns an empty list `[]`.

5. **Return Values:**
   - The `test` method returns a tuple: `(actual_page, empty_page)`.
   - `actual_page` will hold the empty list `[]` returned by `get_page`.
   - `empty_page` already holds an empty list `[]`.
