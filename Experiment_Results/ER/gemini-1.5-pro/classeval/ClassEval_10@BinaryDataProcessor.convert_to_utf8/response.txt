1. **Initialization:**
   - A `BinaryDataProcessor` object `bdp` is created with the binary string "0110100001100101011011000110110001101001".
   - During initialization, `clean_non_binary_chars` is called, but it doesn't modify the string as there are no non-binary characters.

2. **convert_to_utf8() method:**
   - The `convert_to_utf8()` method is called on the `bdp` object.
   - An empty `bytearray` named `byte_array` is created.
   - The code iterates through the binary string in steps of 8 bits (1 byte).
   - For each byte:
     - It extracts the 8-bit substring representing the byte.
     - It converts this byte from binary to its decimal equivalent using `int(byte, 2)`.
     - The decimal value is appended to the `byte_array`.

3. **Decoding:**
   - After processing all bytes, the `byte_array` now holds the decimal representation of each byte.
   - `byte_array.decode('utf-8')` decodes this byte array using UTF-8 encoding, converting it into a human-readable string.

4. **Return Value:**
   - The decoded string, which represents the UTF-8 interpretation of the original binary string, is returned.

**Therefore, the binary string "0110100001100101011011000110110001101001" when decoded as UTF-8 represents the characters "Hello".**
