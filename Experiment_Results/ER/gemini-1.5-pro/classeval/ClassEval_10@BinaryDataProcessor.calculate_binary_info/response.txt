<<<Analysis>>>
1. Inside the `test()` method, a `BinaryDataProcessor` object is created with the binary string "011010011111001".
2. During object initialization:
    - `self.binary_string` is set to "011010011111001".
    - `clean_non_binary_chars()` is called, but since the string only contains '0' and '1', it doesn't modify the string.
3. `calculate_binary_info()` is called:
    - `zeroes_count` is calculated as 6 (number of '0's).
    - `ones_count` is calculated as 9 (number of '1's).
    - `total_length` is calculated as 15 (length of the string).
    - `zeroes_percentage` is calculated as 6/15 = 0.4.
    - `ones_percentage` is calculated as 9/15 = 0.6.
4. A dictionary containing `Zeroes`, `Ones`, and `Bit length` is returned.
<<<Output>>>
{'Zeroes': 0.4, 'Ones': 0.6, 'Bit length': 15}
