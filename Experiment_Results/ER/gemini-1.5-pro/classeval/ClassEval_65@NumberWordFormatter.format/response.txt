Inside the test() method, a NumberWordFormatter object is created and assigned to the variable "formatter".
The formatter.format(1.23) method is then called, which will convert the numeric value 1.23 into its word representation.
Let's break down the execution step-by-step:
1. formatter.format(1.23) is called:
   - It calls format_string("1.23").
2. Inside format_string("1.23"):
   - lstr, rstr = ("1.23".split('.') + [''])[:2] splits the input into two parts: lstr = "1" and rstr = "23".
   - lstrrev is assigned the reversed lstr, so lstrrev = "1".
   - An empty list 'a' is created with a size of 5: a = ['', '', '', '', '']
   - Since the length of lstrrev is 1, it's padded with "00" to make its length a multiple of 3. So, lstrrev becomes "100".
   - lm is initialized as an empty string: lm = "".
   - The for loop runs only once because len(lstrrev) // 3 = 1.
     - Inside the loop:
       - a[0] = "100"[::-1] = "001"
       - Since a[0] is not "000", it calls trans_three("001") which returns "ONE".
       - parse_more(0) returns an empty string.
       - lm is updated to "ONE  " + lm, so lm = "ONE  ".
   - xs = f"AND CENTS {formatter.trans_two("23")} " is executed, resulting in xs = "AND CENTS TWENTY THREE ".
   - Finally, f"{lm.strip()} {xs}ONLY" is evaluated, which becomes "ONE AND CENTS TWENTY THREE ONLY".
Therefore, formatter.format(1.23) returns "ONE AND CENTS TWENTY THREE ONLY".
<<<Output>>>
ONE AND CENTS TWENTY THREE ONLY
