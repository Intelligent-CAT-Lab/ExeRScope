<<<Analysis>>>
1. Inside the `Test.test()` method, a new `NumberWordFormatter` object is created and assigned to the variable `formatter`.
2. The `parse_more(1)` method is called on the `formatter` object.
3. Inside the `parse_more()` method, the input `i` is used as an index to access the `NUMBER_MORE` list.
4. Since `i` is 1, the method returns the element at index 1 of the `NUMBER_MORE` list, which is "THOUSAND".

<<<Output>>>
THOUSAND
