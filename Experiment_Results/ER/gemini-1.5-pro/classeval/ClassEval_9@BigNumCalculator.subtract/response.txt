<<<Analysis>>>
1. **Initialization:**
   - Inside the `test()` method, a `BigNumCalculator` object is created, but it's not needed since we're calling static methods.
   - The `subtract('12345678901234567', '98765432109876543210')` method is called with two numbers as strings.

2. **subtract Method Analysis:**
   - **Comparison and Negation:** Since '12345678901234567' is shorter than '98765432109876543210', the `if len(num1) < len(num2):` condition is met. The numbers are swapped, and `negative` is set to `True`.
   - **Padding:** The shorter number ('12345678901234567') is padded with leading zeros to match the length of the longer number, resulting in:
     - `num1 = '98765432109876543210'`
     - `num2 = '01234567890123456700'`
   - **Subtraction Loop:** The code iterates through the digits from right to left, subtracting the corresponding digits and accounting for borrowing.
   - **Borrowing:**  If `digit_diff` is less than 0, 10 is added to it, and `borrow` is set to 1 for the next iteration.
   - **Result Formation:** The differences are inserted at the beginning of the `result` list.
   - **Leading Zero Removal:** Leading zeros are removed from the result.
   - **Adding Negative Sign:** Since `negative` is `True`, a '-' sign is inserted at the beginning of the result.

3. **Return Value:** The `subtract` method returns '-86419753208641975410'.

<<<Output>>>
