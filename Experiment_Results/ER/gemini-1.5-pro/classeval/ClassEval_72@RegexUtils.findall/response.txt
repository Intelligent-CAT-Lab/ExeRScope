<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method:
1. An instance of the 'RegexUtils' class is created as 'ru'.
2. The 'ru.findall()' method is called with the pattern r'\b\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}\b' and the text "abiguygusu  111-111-1111 kjgufwycs 987-762-9767".
3. Inside the findall() method:
    - It uses the 're.findall()' function with the provided pattern and text.
    - The pattern r'\b\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}\b' searches for phone numbers in the format of three digits, a hyphen, three digits, a hyphen, and four digits, ensuring that the numbers are not embedded within other characters.
    - The 're.findall()' function returns a list containing all non-overlapping matches found in the text.
4. The findall() method returns the list of matched phone numbers.
Therefore, the 'test()' method will return a list containing the two phone numbers found in the text.
<<<Output>>>
['111-111-1111', '987-762-9767']
