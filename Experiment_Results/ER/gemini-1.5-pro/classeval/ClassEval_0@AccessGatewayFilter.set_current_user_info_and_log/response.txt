<<<Analysis>>>
Let's break down the execution of the `Test.test()` method step-by-step:

1. **Initialization:**
   - An instance of `AccessGatewayFilter` is created as `agf`.

2. **First `agf.filter()` Call:**
   - A request dictionary `request = {'path': '/api/data', 'method': 'GET'}` is created.
   - `agf.filter(request)` is called. 
     - Inside `filter()`:
       - `request_uri` is set to '/api/data'.
       - `method` is set to 'GET'.
       - `is_start_with('/api/data')` is called and returns `True` because the path starts with '/api'.
       - The `filter()` method returns `True`.

3. **`agf.is_start_with()` Call:**
   - `request_uri` is set to '/api/data'.
   - `agf.is_start_with(request_uri)` is called.
     - Inside `is_start_with()`:
       - The loop iterates through the `start_with` list.
       - Since `request_uri` starts with '/api', the method returns `True`.

4. **Second `agf.filter()` Call:**
   - A new `request` dictionary is created:
     ```python
     request = {
         'headers': {'Authorization': {'user': {'name': 'user1'}, 'jwt': 'user1' + str(datetime.date.today())}}
     }
     ```
   - `agf.get_jwt_user(request)` is called.
     - Inside `get_jwt_user()`:
       - `token` is extracted from the request headers.
       - Since the 'jwt' in `token` starts with 'user1' (the user's name), the code proceeds to check the JWT expiration.
       - The JWT expiration check involves comparing the current date with the date extracted from the JWT. If the JWT is older than 3 days, `None` would be returned. However, in this case, the JWT was just created using `datetime.date.today()`, so it's not expired.
       - The `get_jwt_user()` method returns the `token` dictionary.

5. **Return Value:**
   - The `Test.test()` method returns a tuple: `(True, True, token)`, where `token` is the dictionary extracted from the request headers.

<<<Output>>>
(True, True, {'user': {'name': 'user1'}, 'jwt': 'user12023-10-27'})
