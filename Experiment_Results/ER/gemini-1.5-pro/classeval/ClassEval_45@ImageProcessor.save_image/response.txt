<<<Analysis>>>
The `test()` method tests the image loading and saving functionality of the `ImageProcessor` class. Let's break down the execution step by step:

1. **Initialization:**
   - An instance of `ImageProcessor` is created and assigned to `self.processor`.
   - The variable `self.image_path` is assigned the path to the test image "test.png".
   - A new RGB image with size (100, 100) and filled with white color (255, 255, 255) is created.
   - This image is saved to the path specified by `self.image_path`.
   - The variable `save_path` is assigned the path for the saved image "test_save.png".

2. **Image Processing:**
   - `self.processor.load_image(self.image_path)`: This line loads the image located at `self.image_path` ("test.png") into the `self.processor` instance.
   - `self.processor.save_image(save_path)`: This line saves the image loaded in the `self.processor` instance to the path specified by `save_path` ("test_save.png").

3. **Return Value:**
   - `saved_image = Image.open(save_path)`: The image from the `save_path` ("test_save.png") is opened using `Image.open()` and assigned to the `saved_image` variable.
   - The `test()` method returns the `saved_image`, which is the opened image from "test_save.png".

Therefore, the `Test.test()` function returns an `Image` object, which represents the image loaded from "test_save.png". This image is a white square with dimensions 100x100 pixels.

<<<Output>>>
<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=100x100 at 0x...>
