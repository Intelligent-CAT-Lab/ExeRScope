<<<Analysis>>>
1. **Initialization:** An instance of `MovieBookingSystem` is created and assigned to `self.system`.
2. **Adding Movies:**
   - `add_movie` is called twice to add 'Batman' and 'Spiderman' movies with their respective details. 
   - Each movie is stored as a dictionary with name, price, start and end times (converted to datetime objects), and a NumPy array `seats` representing available seats.
3. **Calling `available_movies`:**
   - The `available_movies` method is called with '20:00' and '23:00' as start and end times, which are also converted to datetime objects.
4. **Filtering Movies:**
   - The code iterates through each movie in `self.movies`.
   - For each movie, it checks if the movie's start time is greater than or equal to the given start time ('20:00') and if the movie's end time is less than or equal to the given end time ('23:00').
   - If both conditions are met, the movie's name is appended to the `available_movies` list.
5. **Returning Available Movies:**
   - After checking all movies, the `available_movies` list, containing the names of movies that fit the given time slot, is returned. 

In this case, only 'Spiderman' fits the time slot, so the returned list will contain only 'Spiderman'.

<<<Output>>>
['Spiderman']
