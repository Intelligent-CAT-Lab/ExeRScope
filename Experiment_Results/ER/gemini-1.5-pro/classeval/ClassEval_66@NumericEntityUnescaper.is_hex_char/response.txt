<<<Analysis>>>
1. Inside the `test()` method, an instance of the `NumericEntityUnescaper` class is created as `unescaper`.
2. The `is_hex_char('F')` method is called on this instance with the input 'F'.
3. Inside the `is_hex_char()` method:
    - It checks if the input character `char` (which is 'F') is a digit using `char.isdigit()`. It is not, so it moves to the next condition.
    - It checks if the lowercase of the character (which is 'f') is between 'a' and 'f'. This is True.
    - Since one of the conditions is True, the method returns `True`.
4. The `test()` method receives this `True` value and returns it as the result.

<<<Output>>>
