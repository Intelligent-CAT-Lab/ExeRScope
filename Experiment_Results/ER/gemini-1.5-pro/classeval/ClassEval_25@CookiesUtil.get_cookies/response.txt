<<<Analysis>>>
1. Inside the `test()` method, a `CookiesUtil` object is created with the filename 'cookies.json'.
2. A dictionary named `response` is created containing multiple dictionaries with keys like 'cookies', 'cookies2', 'cookies3', and 'cookies4'. Each of these nested dictionaries contains key-value pairs representing cookies.
3. The `get_cookies()` method of the `cookies_util` object is called with the `response` dictionary.
4. Inside the `get_cookies()` method:
    - It retrieves the dictionary associated with the key 'cookies' from the `response` dictionary and assigns it to the `self.cookies` instance variable.
    - It then calls the `_save_cookies()` method to save these cookies to the file 'cookies.json'.
5. Finally, the `test()` method returns the value of `self.cookies_util.cookies`, which now holds the dictionary `{'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2'}`.
<<<Output>>>
{'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2'}
