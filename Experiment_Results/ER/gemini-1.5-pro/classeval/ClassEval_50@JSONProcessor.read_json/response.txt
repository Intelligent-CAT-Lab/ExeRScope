<<<Analysis>>>
1. Inside the `test()` method, a `JSONProcessor` object is created and assigned to `self.processor`.
2. A dictionary `self.test_data` is defined containing three key-value pairs.
3. A file path `self.file_path` is set to "test.json".
4. The code opens the file at `self.file_path` in write mode ('w') and writes the string "Invalid JSON" to it. This simulates having a file with invalid JSON content.
5. The `read_json` method of the `JSONProcessor` object is called with `self.file_path` as an argument.
6. Inside the `read_json` method:
    - The code checks if the file at `file_path` exists. If it doesn't exist, it returns 0. But in this case, the file exists, so it proceeds to the next step.
    - It tries to open the file in read mode ('r') and load its content as JSON using `json.load(file)`.
    - Since the file contains "Invalid JSON", an exception will be raised by `json.load(file)`.
    - Because of the exception, the code enters the `except` block and returns -1.
7. Therefore, the `read_json` method returns -1, which is then returned by the `test()` method.
