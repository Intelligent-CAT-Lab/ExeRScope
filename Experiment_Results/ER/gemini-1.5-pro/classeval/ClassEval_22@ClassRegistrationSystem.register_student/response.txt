<<<Analysis>>>
1. Inside the test() method, an instance of ClassRegistrationSystem is created and assigned to self.registration_system.
2. A dictionary representing student1 with name "John" and major "Computer Science" is created.
3. self.registration_system.register_student(student1) is called for the first time. Since the student list is empty, student1 is added to the list and the function returns 1.
4. self.registration_system.register_student(student1) is called again. Now, student1 is already present in the student list. So, the function returns 0.
5. Therefore the returned value of the last function call 'self.registration_system.register_student(student1)'  will be 0.
<<<Output>>>
0
