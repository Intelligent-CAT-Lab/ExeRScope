The code defines a `PDFHandler` class for merging and extracting text from PDF files using the `PyPDF2` library. However, the provided code snippet is missing the implementation of `TestPDFHandler.setUpClass()` and the definition of `TestPDFHandler.test_files`, which are crucial for the test to run. 

Assuming `TestPDFHandler.setUpClass()` initializes `TestPDFHandler.test_files` with a list of valid PDF file paths, here's a breakdown of the code execution:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `TestPDFHandler.setUpClass()` is called twice, likely meant to set up resources for the test.
   - A `PDFHandler` object is created with the file paths from `TestPDFHandler.test_files`.

2. **Merging PDFs:**
   - `handler.merge_pdfs("merged.pdf")` is called to merge the PDFs.
   - The method iterates through each PDF reader, extracts each page, and adds it to a `PdfWriter` object.
   - Finally, the merged content is written to a file named "merged.pdf".
   - The method returns a string "Merged PDFs saved at merged.pdf".

3. **Return Value:**
   - The `test()` method returns a tuple:
     - The first element is the return value of `handler.merge_pdfs()`, which is the string "Merged PDFs saved at merged.pdf".
     - The second element is the result of `os.path.exists('merged.pdf')`, which checks if the merged PDF file exists. If the merging process is successful, this should return `True`.

("Merged PDFs saved at merged.pdf", True)
