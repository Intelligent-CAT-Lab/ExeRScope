<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method:
1. It creates an instance of the `AccessGatewayFilter` class.
2. It defines a `request_uri` variable with the value '/def/data'.
3. It calls the `is_start_with()` method of the `agf` object, passing `request_uri` as an argument.
4. The `is_start_with()` method iterates through the `start_with` list which contains two strings: '/api' and '/login'.
5. For each string in the list, it checks if the `request_uri` starts with that string using the `startswith()` method.
6. Since '/def/data' does not start with either '/api' or '/login', the `startswith()` method returns False for both strings in the list.
7. As a result, the loop completes without returning True, and the `is_start_with()` method returns False.
8. The `test()` method returns the value returned by `is_start_with()`, which is False.
