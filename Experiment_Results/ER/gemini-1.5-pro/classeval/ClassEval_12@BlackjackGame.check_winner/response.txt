<<<Analysis>>>
The `test()` method first creates an instance of the `BlackjackGame` class. Then it creates two lists, `player_hand` and `dealer_hand`, representing the player's and dealer's hands in the game. 

Here's how the code determines the winner:

1. **Calculate Hand Values:**
   -  `player_hand`: '2S', '4S', '5S'  sum up to 2 + 4 + 5 = 11
   -  `dealer_hand`: '2S', 'JS', 'QS' sum up to 2 + 10 + 10 = 22

2. **Determine the Winner:**
   - The `check_winner` function in `BlackjackGame` compares the hand values.
   - Since the dealer's hand value (22) is greater than 21, the dealer busts. 
   - Therefore, the player wins.

<<<Output>>>
Player wins
