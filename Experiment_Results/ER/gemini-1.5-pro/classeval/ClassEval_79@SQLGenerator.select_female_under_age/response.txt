<<<Analysis>>>
1. Inside the `Test.test()` method, a `SQLGenerator` object is created with the table name 'table1'.
2. The `select_female_under_age()` method is called on the `sql` object with the age parameter set to 40.
3. Inside the `select_female_under_age()` method:
   - A condition string is created as `"age < 40 AND gender = 'female'"`.
   - The `select()` method of the class is called with this condition.
4. Inside the `select()` method:
   - Since no fields are provided, `fields` is set to "*".
   - The SQL query string is constructed as `"SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE age < 40 AND gender = 'female'"`.
   - A semicolon is appended to the query.
5. The final SQL query string is returned.

<<<Output>>>
SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE age < 40 AND gender = 'female';
