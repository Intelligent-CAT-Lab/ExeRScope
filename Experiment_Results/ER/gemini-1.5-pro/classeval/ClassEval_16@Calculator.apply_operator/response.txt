<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method:
1. We create an instance of the Calculator class.
2. We define the operand_stack with values [1, 2, 3] and operator_stack with ['+', '*'].
3. We call the apply_operator method on the calculator object with operand_stack and operator_stack.
4. Inside apply_operator:
   - The last operator '*' is popped from operator_stack.
   - operand2 = 3 and operand1 = 2 are popped from operand_stack.
   - result = 2 * 3 = 6 is calculated.
   - result = 6 is pushed onto the operand_stack.
   - The next operator '+' is popped from operator_stack.
   - operand2 = 6 and operand1 = 1 are popped from operand_stack.
   - result = 1 + 6 = 7 is calculated.
   - result = 7 is pushed onto the operand_stack.
5. The modified operand_stack which is [7] and operator_stack which is [] are returned.
<<<Output>>>
([7], [])
