<<<Analysis>>>
1. Inside the `test()` method, an instance of the `CamelCaseMap` class is created and assigned to the variable `camelize_map`.
2. The line `camelize_map['age'] = 30` attempts to set the value 30 for the key 'age' in the `camelize_map` object. 
   - Since `CamelCaseMap` defines the `__setitem__` magic method, this method is called internally. 
   - Inside `__setitem__`, the `_convert_key` method is called to convert the input key 'age' to camel case. However, since 'age' is already in lowercase, it remains unchanged.
   - Finally, the key 'age' and value 30 are stored in the `_data` dictionary of the `camelize_map` object.
3. The line `return camelize_map.__getitem__('age')` tries to retrieve the value associated with the key 'age'.
   - Again, the `__getitem__` magic method is invoked. 
   - Inside `__getitem__`, the `_convert_key` method is called again on the key 'age', which remains unchanged.
   - The value associated with the key 'age', which is 30, is then retrieved from the `_data` dictionary and returned.
Therefore, the `test()` method will return the value associated with the key 'age' which is 30.

<<<Output>>>
30
