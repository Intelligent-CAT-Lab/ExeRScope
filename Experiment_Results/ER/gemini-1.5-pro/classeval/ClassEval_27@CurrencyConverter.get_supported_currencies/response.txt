<<<Analysis>>>
1. Inside the `test()` method, a `CurrencyConverter` object `cc` is created. This initializes the `rates` dictionary within the object.
2. The `cc.get_supported_currencies()` method is called. This method accesses the `rates` dictionary of the `cc` object.
3. Inside `get_supported_currencies()`, `self.rates.keys()` returns a view object containing all the keys of the `rates` dictionary, which represent the supported currencies.
4. The `list()` function converts this view object into a list.
5. This list of supported currencies is then returned by the `get_supported_currencies()` method and subsequently by the `test()` method.

<<<Output>>>
['USD', 'EUR', 'GBP', 'JPY', 'CAD', 'AUD', 'CNY']
