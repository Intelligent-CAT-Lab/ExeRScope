<<<Analysis>>>
1. Inside the `test()` method, a `Warehouse` object is created.
2. The `add_product` method is called with `product_id=1`, `name='product 1'`, and `quantity=5`.
   - Since the product ID 1 does not exist in the inventory, a new entry is created in the `self.inventory` dictionary with the given details.
3. The `get_product_quantity` method is called with `product_id=1`.
   - As product ID 1 exists in the inventory, the quantity associated with it, which is 5, is returned.
<<<Output>>>
5
