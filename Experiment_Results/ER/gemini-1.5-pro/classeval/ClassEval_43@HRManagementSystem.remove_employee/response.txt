<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method, an instance of the HRManagementSystem class is created as hr_system.
Then, the employees attribute of the hr_system object is initialized with a dictionary containing information for employee with ID 1.
Next, hr_system.remove_employee(1) is called with employee ID 1. Inside the remove_employee() method:
-> It checks if the employee ID 1 exists in the hr_system.employees dictionary.
-> Since the employee ID exists, it removes the employee with ID 1 from the dictionary.
-> The method returns True to indicate successful removal.
Finally, the return statement returns a tuple containing the return value of hr_system.remove_employee(1) (which is True) and the updated hr_system.employees dictionary (which is now empty).
<<<Output>>>
