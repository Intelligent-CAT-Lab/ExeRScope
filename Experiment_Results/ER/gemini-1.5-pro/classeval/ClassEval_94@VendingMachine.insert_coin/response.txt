<<<Analysis>>>
1. Inside the test() method, a VendingMachine object is created using VendingMachine().
2. vendingMachine.balance is set to 1.25.
3. vendingMachine.insert_coin(1.25) is called three times. Each time this method is called, it adds the given amount to the vendingMachine.balance.
Therefore, vendingMachine.balance is updated as follows:
    - 1.25 + 1.25 = 2.50
    - 2.50 + 1.25 = 3.75
    - 3.75 + 1.25 = 5.00
4. Finally, the vendingMachine.balance, which is 5.00, is returned.
<<<Output>>>
5.0
