 Inside the test() method:
1. An instance of the `EncryptionUtils` class is created with the key "key" and assigned to the variable `encryption_utils`.
2. The `vigenere_cipher` method of the `encryption_utils` object is called with the plaintext "abc".
3. Inside the `vigenere_cipher` method:
    - It initializes an empty string `encrypted_text` to store the encrypted text.
    - It sets the initial `key_index` to 0.
    - It iterates through each character (`char`) of the plaintext "abc":
        - For the first character 'a':
            - `shift` is calculated as the difference between the ASCII value of 'k' (from the key "key" at index 0) and the ASCII value of 'a', which is 10.
            - `encrypted_char` is calculated by shifting 'a' by 10 positions, resulting in 'k'.
            - `encrypted_text` becomes "K" (as 'a' is lowercase, it's converted to uppercase).
            - `key_index` is incremented to 1.
        - For the second character 'b':
            - `shift` is calculated as the difference between the ASCII value of 'e' (from the key "key" at index 1) and the ASCII value of 'a', which is 4.
            - `encrypted_char` is calculated by shifting 'b' by 4 positions, resulting in 'f'.
            - `encrypted_text` becomes "Kf".
            - `key_index` is incremented to 2.
        - For the third character 'c':
            - `shift` is calculated as the difference between the ASCII value of 'y' (from the key "key" at index 2) and the ASCII value of 'a', which is 25.
            - `encrypted_char` is calculated by shifting 'c' by 25 positions, resulting in 'b'.
            - `encrypted_text` becomes "Kfb".
            - `key_index` is incremented to 3.
    - Finally, the `vigenere_cipher` method returns the `encrypted_text`, which is "Kfb".
4. The `test` method returns the result of `encryption_utils.vigenere_cipher('abc')`, which is "Kfb".
