<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method, a Server object is created and assigned to the variable `server`.
Next, the `server.recv()` method is called with a dictionary argument `{"content": "abc"}`.
Inside the `recv()` method:
    - It first checks if the input `info` is a dictionary and contains the keys "addr" and "content".
    - Since the input is missing the "addr" key, the method returns -1.
The value of `server.receive_struct` remains an empty dictionary {} because the `recv()` method returned -1 before updating it.
Finally, `test()` returns a tuple containing the values of `server.receive_struct` which is an empty dictionary {} and `flag` which is -1.
<<<Output>>>
({}, -1)
