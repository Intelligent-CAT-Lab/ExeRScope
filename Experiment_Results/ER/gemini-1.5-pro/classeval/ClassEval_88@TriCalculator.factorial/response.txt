<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method, a TriCalculator object is instantiated and then the factorial(2) method is invoked on it. The purpose of this method is to calculate the factorial of a given number a. In this case, a = 2.
Inside the factorial(), the variable b is initialized to 1.
The while loop starts, and since a (which is 2) is not equal to 1, the loop's body is executed.
Inside the loop:
- b is multiplied by a (b *= a): b becomes 1 * 2 = 2.
- a is decremented by 1 (a -= 1): a becomes 2 - 1 = 1.
Now, a is 1, so the loop's condition (a != 1) becomes false, and the loop terminates.
Finally, the method returns the value of b, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
