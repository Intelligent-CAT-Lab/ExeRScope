<<<Analysis>>>
1. Inside the `test()` method, a `Warehouse` object is created.
2. `warehouse.add_product(1, 'product 4', 5)` adds a product with id 1, name 'product 4', and quantity 5 to the warehouse.
3. `warehouse.create_order(1, 1, 5)` attempts to create an order for product 1 with quantity 5.
    - Since the warehouse has sufficient quantity, the order is created with id 1, product_id 1, quantity 5, and status 'Shipped'.
    - The product quantity in the inventory is also updated by reducing it by 5.
4. Finally, `warehouse.orders` is returned, which contains the details of the created order.
<<<Output>>>
{1: {'product_id': 1, 'quantity': 5, 'status': 'Shipped'}}
