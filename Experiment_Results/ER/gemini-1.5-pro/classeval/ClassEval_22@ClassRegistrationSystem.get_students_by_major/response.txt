<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method:
1. An instance of ClassRegistrationSystem is created and assigned to self.registration_system.
2. A list of dictionaries representing students and their majors is assigned to self.registration_system.students.
3. The get_students_by_major() method is called twice with "Computer Science" and "Mathematics" as arguments, respectively.
4. Inside the get_students_by_major(major) method:
    - An empty list student_list is created.
    - The method iterates through each student in self.students.
    - For each student, it checks if their "major" matches the input major.
    - If the major matches, the student's "name" is appended to the student_list.
    - After iterating through all students, the student_list is returned.
5. The first call to get_students_by_major("Computer Science") returns ["John", "Bob"] because John and Bob are the only students with the major "Computer Science".
6. The second call to get_students_by_major("Mathematics") returns ["Alice", "Tom", "Jerry"] because Alice, Tom, and Jerry are the students with the major "Mathematics".
7. Finally, the test() method returns a tuple containing these two lists: (["John", "Bob"], ["Alice", "Tom", "Jerry"]).

<<<Output>>>
(['John', 'Bob'], ['Alice', 'Tom', 'Jerry'])
