<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method:
1.  an instance of the Calculator class is created and assigned to the variable `calculator`.
2.  `calculator.precedence('+')` is called. This looks up the precedence of the '+' operator in the `precedences` dictionary defined within the `precedence` method. The '+' operator has a precedence of 1. So, `res1` is assigned the value 1.
3.  Similarly, `calculator.precedence('-')` is called, which also returns 1 because the '-' operator has a precedence of 1 as well. This value is assigned to `res2`.
4.  Finally, the `test()` method returns a tuple containing `res1` and `res2`.

<<<Output>>>
(1, 1)
