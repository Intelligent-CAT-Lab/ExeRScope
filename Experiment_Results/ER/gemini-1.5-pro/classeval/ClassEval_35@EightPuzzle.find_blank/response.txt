<<<Analysis>>>
1. **Initialization:** 
   - Inside the `test()` method, an instance of the `EightPuzzle` class is created with the initial state `[[2, 3, 4], [5, 8, 1], [6, 8, 7]]`.
   - This state is stored within the `eightPuzzle` object.

2. **Calling `find_blank()`:**
   - The `find_blank(state)` method is called on the `eightPuzzle` object, with the initial state `state` passed as an argument.

3. **Inside `find_blank()`:**
   - The method iterates through each row and column of the `state` using nested loops.
   - For each cell, it checks if the value is equal to 0.
   - When it finds the cell with the value 0 (representing the blank tile), it returns the row and column index of that cell (`i` and `j`).

4. **Return Value:**
   - In the given `state`, the blank tile (0) is located at row 2, column 2 (indices start from 0).
   - Therefore, the `find_blank()` method will return the tuple `(2, 2)`.

<<<Output>>>
(2, 2)
