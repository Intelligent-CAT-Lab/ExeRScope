<<<Analysis>>>
1. **Initialization:**
   - `character1` (John) is created with 100 HP, 20 Attack Power, and 10 Defense.
   - `character2` (Enemy) is created with 100 HP, 15 Attack Power, and 5 Defense.

2. **First Attack:**
   - `character1.attack(character2)` is called.
   - Damage calculation: `character1.attack_power (20) - character2.defense (5) = 15`
   - `character2.hp` is reduced by 15: `100 - 15 = 85`

3. **Second Attack:**
   - `character1.attack(character2)` is called again.
   - Damage calculation: `character1.attack_power (20) - character2.defense (5) = 15`
   - `character2.hp` is reduced by another 15: `85 - 15 = 70`

4. **Return Value:**
   - The function returns `character2.hp`, which is now `70`.

<<<Output>>>
70
