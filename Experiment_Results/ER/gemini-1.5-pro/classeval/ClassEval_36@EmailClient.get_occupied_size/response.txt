<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method, two EmailClient objects are created: sender and receiver.
The sender object's inbox is initialized with two emails, each having sizes 20 and 30, respectively.
The sender.get_occupied_size() method is called, which calculates the total size occupied by emails in the sender's inbox.
Inside get_occupied_size(), a variable occupied_size is initialized to 0.
The code then iterates through each email in the sender's inbox and adds the size of each email to occupied_size.
For the first email: occupied_size = 0 + 20 = 20
For the second email: occupied_size = 20 + 30 = 50
Finally, the method returns occupied_size, which is 50.
<<<Output>>>
50
