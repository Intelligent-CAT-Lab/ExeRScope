<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method, a ComplexCalculator object is instantiated. Then, it calls the divide() method of the ComplexCalculator class with two complex numbers, (1 + 2j) and (3 + 4j).

Let's break down the divide() method:
1. It calculates the denominator by squaring the real and imaginary parts of the second complex number (3 + 4j) and adding them: 3**2 + 4**2 = 25.
2. It calculates the real part of the result: ((1 * 3) + (2 * 4)) / 25 = 11/25.
3. It calculates the imaginary part of the result: ((2 * 3) - (1 * 4)) / 25 = 2/25.
4. Finally, it constructs a new complex number using the calculated real and imaginary parts: complex(11/25, 2/25).

Therefore, the divide() method returns the complex number (11/25 + 2/25j).
<<<Output>>>
(0.44+0.08j)
