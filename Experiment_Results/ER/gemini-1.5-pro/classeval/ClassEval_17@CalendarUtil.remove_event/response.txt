<<<Analysis>>>
1. Inside the `test()` method, a `CalendarUtil` object is created and its `events` attribute is initialized with two events.
2. The `remove_event` method is called with an event dictionary as an argument.
3. In `remove_event`, it checks if the given event exists in the `self.events` list.
4. The event to be removed matches the second event in `self.events`.
5. The `remove()` method of the list is called to delete the matching event.
6. Finally, the `test()` method returns the updated `calendar.events` list, which now contains only the first event.
