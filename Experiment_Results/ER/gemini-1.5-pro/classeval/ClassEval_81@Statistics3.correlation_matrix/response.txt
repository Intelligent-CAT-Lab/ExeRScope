<<<Analysis>>>
The `test()` method creates an instance of the `Statistics3` class and then calls the `correlation_matrix` method with a 5x3 matrix. Let's break down how `correlation_matrix` calculates the output:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `matrix`: An empty list to store the correlation matrix.
   - It then iterates through each column of the input data using nested loops.

2. **Column Extraction:**
   - For each pair of column indices `i` and `j`, it extracts the corresponding columns (`column1`, `column2`) from the input data.

3. **Correlation Calculation:**
   - It calls the `correlation` method, passing in the extracted `column1` and `column2`.

4. **Correlation Method (`correlation(x, y)`)**:
   - Calculates the Pearson correlation coefficient between two columns `x` and `y`.
   - Returns the calculated correlation coefficient.

5. **Matrix Population:**
   - The calculated correlation value is appended to the `row`.
   - After iterating through all columns (`j`), the `row` is appended to the `matrix`.

6. **Return:**
   - Finally, the `correlation_matrix` method returns the populated `matrix`.

Since the input data consists of perfectly linearly dependent columns (each column is a multiple of the others), the correlation coefficient between any two columns will be 1.
