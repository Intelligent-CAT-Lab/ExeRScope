<<<Analysis>>>
The test() method calls the static method _to_camel_case() of the CamelCaseMap class with the string 'first_name' as input.

Let's break down what happens inside the _to_camel_case() method:

1. **Split the string:** The input string 'first_name' is split into a list of parts based on the underscore '_' character. This results in the list: ['first', 'name'].

2. **Capitalize parts:** The code then iterates through the parts list, starting from the second element (index 1). It capitalizes the first letter of each part using the title() method. In this case, 'name' becomes 'Name'.

3. **Join the parts:** Finally, the code joins the first part ('first') with the capitalized remaining parts ('Name') using an empty string as the separator. This results in the string 'firstName'.

Therefore, the _to_camel_case('first_name') method returns 'firstName'.
<<<Output>>>
firstName
