<<<Analysis>>>
Let's break down how the code determines the longest palindromic substring for the input 'ababax':

1. **Initialization:**
   - A `Manacher` object is created with the input string 'ababax'.
   - Inside the `test` method:
     - `manacher = Manacher('ababax')` 
   - This initializes the `input_string` attribute of the `manacher` object to 'ababax'.

2. **Preprocessing the String:**
   - The `palindromic_string` method is called.
   - A new string `new_input_string` is created by inserting "|" between each character of the original string to handle even-length palindromes. 
   - For 'ababax', `new_input_string` becomes  'a|b|a|b|a|x'.

3. **Finding Palindromes:**
   - The code iterates through each character (and "|") in `new_input_string`.
   - For each position `i`, it calls `palindromic_length` to calculate the length of the palindrome centered at that position.
   - `palindromic_length` recursively expands outwards from the center (`i`) as long as the characters on both sides match and are within the string bounds.

4. **Tracking the Longest Palindrome:**
   - `max_length` keeps track of the maximum palindrome length found.
   - `start` stores the starting index of the longest palindrome.

5. **Extracting the Longest Palindrome:**
   - After iterating through all positions, the substring from `start - max_length` to `start + max_length + 1` in `new_input_string` contains the longest palindrome.
   - The code removes the "|" characters to get the final output string.

**Step-by-step for 'ababax':**

   - `new_input_string` = 'a|b|a|b|a|x'
   - The longest palindrome is 'ababa' centered at index 4 (the second 'a').
   - `max_length` will be 5 (length of 'ababa').
   - `start` will be 4.
   - The substring from index -1 to 9 is extracted: 'a|b|a|b|a'.
   - After removing '|', the output string is 'ababa'.
