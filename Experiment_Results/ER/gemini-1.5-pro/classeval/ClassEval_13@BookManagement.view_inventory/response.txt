<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method, a new BookManagement object is created and assigned to the variable bookManagement.
The add_book() method is called twice on the bookManagement object.
- The first call adds "book1" with a quantity of 2 to the inventory. Since "book1" is not in the inventory, a new entry is created with a quantity of 2.
- The second call adds "book2" with a default quantity of 1 to the inventory. Since "book2" is not in the inventory, a new entry is created with a quantity of 1.
The expected dictionary is created with the expected inventory state: {"book1": 2, "book2": 1}.
Finally, a tuple is returned containing the expected dictionary and the actual inventory of the bookManagement object.
<<<Output>>>
({'book1': 2, 'book2': 1}, {'book1': 2, 'book2': 1})
