<<<Analysis>>>
We first create a StockPortfolioTracker object with an initial cash balance of 10000.0. The portfolio is initialized with 10 shares of AAPL at a price of 150.0.
1. 'tracker.buy_stock({'name': 'MSFT', 'price': 150.0, 'quantity': 10})`: This attempts to buy 10 shares of MSFT at a price of 150.0. The total cost would be 1500.0, which is less than the cash balance. Thus, the buy is successful. The cash balance is updated to 8500.0 (10000.0 - 1500.0), and the portfolio is updated to include the MSFT shares.
2. `tracker.buy_stock({'name': 'MSFT', 'price': 150.0, 'quantity': 10})`: This attempts to buy another 10 shares of MSFT. Since we already have MSFT in our portfolio, this buy will increase the quantity of the existing MSFT stock. The total cost is again 1500.0, which is less than the current cash balance. The buy is successful, the cash balance reduces to 7000.0, and the quantity of MSFT shares in the portfolio becomes 20.
3. `tracker.portfolio`: This returns the current state of the portfolio, which includes 10 shares of AAPL at a price of 150.0 and 20 shares of MSFT at a price of 150.0.
4. `tracker.cash_balance`: This returns the remaining cash balance, which is 7000.0 after the two buy transactions.
<<<Output>>>
(True, True, [{'name': 'AAPL', 'price': 150.0, 'quantity': 10}, {'name': 'MSFT', 'price': 150.0, 'quantity': 20}], 7000.0)
