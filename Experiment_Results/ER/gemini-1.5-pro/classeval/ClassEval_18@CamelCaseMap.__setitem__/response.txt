<<<Analysis>>>
1. **Initialization:** An instance of `CamelCaseMap` is created and assigned to the variable `camelize_map`.

2. **Setting 'first_name':**
   - The line `camelize_map['first_name'] = 'John'` triggers the `__setitem__` method of the `CamelCaseMap` class.
   - Inside `__setitem__`, the `_convert_key` method is called to transform the key `'first_name'` into camel case (`'firstName'`).
   - The value `'John'` is then stored in the `_data` dictionary of `camelize_map` with the key `'firstName'`.

3. **Setting 'first_Name':**
   - The line `camelize_map.__setitem__('first_Name', 'newname')` directly calls the `__setitem__` method.
   - Again, `_convert_key` is used, but this time it converts `'first_Name'` to `'firstName'` (as it capitalizes the first letter of each part after splitting by '_').
   -  The value `'newname'` is stored in the `_data` dictionary with the key `'firstName'`, overwriting the previous value `'John'`.

4. **Retrieving 'first_name':**
   - Finally, `camelize_map['first_name']` is executed, which calls the `__getitem__` method.
   -  `_convert_key` transforms `'first_name'` into `'firstName'`.
   - The value associated with the key `'firstName'` is retrieved from the `_data` dictionary, which is now `'newname'`.
