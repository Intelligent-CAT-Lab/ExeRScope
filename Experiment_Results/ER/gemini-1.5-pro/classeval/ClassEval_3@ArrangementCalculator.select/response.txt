Inside the test() method:
1. An instance of ArrangementCalculator is created with the input list [1, 2] and assigned to the variable 'ac'.
2. The select() method is called on the 'ac' object. Since no argument is provided for 'm', it defaults to the length of the data list, which is 2.
3. Inside the select() method:
    - An empty list called 'result' is created.
    - The code then iterates through all permutations of the data list ([1, 2]) of length 2, generated by itertools.permutations([1, 2], 2).
    - For each permutation generated:
        - It is converted to a list.
        - The list is appended to the 'result' list.
    - Finally, the 'result' list, which now contains all permutations of the input list, is returned.
4. The test() method then returns a tuple containing the result of ac.select() which is [[1, 2], [2, 1]] and the expected value which is [[1, 2], [2, 1]].
<<<Output>>>
([[1, 2], [2, 1]], [[1, 2], [2, 1]])
