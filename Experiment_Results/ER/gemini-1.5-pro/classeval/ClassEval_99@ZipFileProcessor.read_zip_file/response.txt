<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a test function that creates a zip file, reads its content, closes the file, and then tries to access its filename and mode after it has been closed. Let's break down the code step-by-step:

1. **Setup:**
   - It creates a directory 'test_folder'.
   - It creates a text file 'example.txt' inside the 'test_folder'.
   - It writes "This is an example file." into 'example.txt'.

2. **Zipping:**
   - It creates a zip file 'example3.zip'.
   - It adds 'example.txt' to the zip file.

3. **Reading the zip file:**
   - It creates a `ZipFileProcessor` object, passing the zip file name.
   - It calls `read_zip_file` which opens the zip file in read mode and returns the zip object.

4. **Closing the zip file:**
   - It closes the `zip_file` using `zip_file.close()`.

5. **Cleanup:**
   - It deletes the 'example3.zip' file.
   - It deletes the 'example.txt' file.
   - It removes the 'test_folder' directory.

6. **Returning the values:**
   - It tries to access `zip_file.filename` and `zip_file.mode` after the zip file is closed. This will raise a `ValueError` because the ZipFile object is no longer active.

<<<Output>>>
```python
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 38, in test
ValueError: I/O operation on closed ZipFile
```
