<<<Analysis>>>
1. Inside the `test()` method, an instance of the `RegexUtils` class is created as `ru`.
2. The `validate_phone_number()` method of the `ru` object is called with the argument "1234567890".
3. Inside the `validate_phone_number()` method:
    - It calls the `generate_phone_number_pattern()` method which returns the pattern  `r'\b\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}\b'`.
    - Then it calls the `match()` method with the pattern and the input phone number "1234567890".
4. Inside the `match()` method:
    - It uses `re.match()` to match the pattern `r'\b\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}\b'` against the input "1234567890".
    - Since `re.match()` tries to match the pattern only at the beginning of the string, it will not find a match for the given input.
    - Therefore, `re.match()` returns None, and the `match()` method returns `False`.
5. Finally, the `validate_phone_number()` method returns `False`, which is then returned as the result of the `test()` method.
