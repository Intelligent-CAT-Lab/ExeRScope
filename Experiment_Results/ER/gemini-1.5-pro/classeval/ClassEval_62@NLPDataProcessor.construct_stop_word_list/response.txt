<<<Analysis>>>
1. Inside the `test()` method, an instance of the `NLPDataProcessor` class is created as `self.processor`.
2. The `construct_stop_word_list()` method of the `self.processor` object is called, which returns a list containing three stop words: 'a', 'an', and 'the'. This list is assigned to the variable `stop_word_list`.
3. Another list named `expected_stop_words` is created, containing the same three stop words: 'a', 'an', and 'the'.
4. Finally, the `test()` method returns a tuple containing both `stop_word_list` and `expected_stop_words`.

<<<Output>>>
(['a', 'an', 'the'], ['a', 'an', 'the'])
