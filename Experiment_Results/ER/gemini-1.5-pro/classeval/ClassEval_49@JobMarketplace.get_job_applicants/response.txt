<<<Analysis>>>
The `test()` method sets up a `JobMarketplace` instance with two resumes and one job listing. It then calls `get_job_applicants()` with the first job listing in the `job_listings` list.

Let's analyze the `get_job_applicants()` method:

1. It initializes an empty list called `applicants`.
2. It iterates through each resume in `self.resumes`.
3. For each resume, it calls the `matches_requirements()` method, passing in the resume and the requirements from the provided job.
4. The `matches_requirements()` method checks if *all* skills listed in the resume are present in the job requirements. 
    - In this case, neither Tom's skills ('skill1', 'skill2') nor John's skills ('skill3', 'skill4') are present in the job requirements ('skill6', 'skill7').
    - Therefore, `matches_requirements()` will return `False` for both resumes.
5. Since `matches_requirements()` returns `False`, neither resume is added to the `applicants` list.
6. Finally, `get_job_applicants()` returns the `applicants` list, which is still empty.
