<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method, a ComplexCalculator object is instantiated. Then, the multiply method of the ComplexCalculator class is called with two complex numbers (1 + 2j) and (3 + 4j) as arguments.

Inside the multiply() method:
1. c1.real is 1, c1.imag is 2, c2.real is 3, and c2.imag is 4.
2. real is calculated as (1 * 3) - (2 * 4) = -5.
3. imaginary is calculated as (1 * 4) + (2 * 3) = 10.
4. The method returns a new complex number with the calculated real and imaginary parts: complex(-5, 10), which is -5 + 10j.

<<<Output>>>
(-5+10j)
