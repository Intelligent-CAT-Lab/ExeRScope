<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method:
1. We create an instance of the Classroom class with id 1.
2. We define a course dictionary with details - name: 'Art', start_time: '14:00', and end_time: '15:00'.
3. We call the add_course method on the classroom object, passing in the course dictionary. Inside the add_course method:
    - It checks if the course is not already present in the classroom's courses list.
    - Since the classroom's courses list is empty, the course is appended to the list.
4. Finally, the test() method returns a tuple containing the course dictionary and the classroom's courses list, which now contains the added course.
<<<Output>>>
({'name': 'Art', 'start_time': '14:00', 'end_time': '15:00'}, [{'name': 'Art', 'start_time': '14:00', 'end_time': '15:00'}])
