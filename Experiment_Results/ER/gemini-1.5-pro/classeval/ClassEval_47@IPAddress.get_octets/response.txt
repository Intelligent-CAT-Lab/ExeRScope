<<<Analysis>>>
1. Inside the `test()` method of the `Test` class, an instance of the `IPAddress` class is created with the IP address "10.10.10.10".
2. The `get_octets()` method is called on this `IPAddress` object.
3. Inside the `get_octets()` method:
    - It first checks if the IP address is valid using `self.is_valid()`.
    - Since "10.10.10.10" is a valid IP address, `is_valid()` would return `True`.
    - Therefore, the method proceeds to split the IP address string by the "." delimiter and returns a list of octets.
4. The `test()` method will return the list of octets. 
<<<Output>>>
['10', '10', '10', '10']
