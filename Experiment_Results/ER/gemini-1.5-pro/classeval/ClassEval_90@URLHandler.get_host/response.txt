<<<Analysis>>>
1. Inside the `Test.test()` method, a `URLHandler` object is created with the URL "https://aaa.com/openai/human-eval".
2. The `get_host()` method of the `urlhandler` object is called.
3. Inside the `get_host()` method:
    - It first finds the index of "://" to determine the scheme's end. In this case, it's 6.
    - It then extracts the URL without the scheme, which is "aaa.com/openai/human-eval".
    - Next, it finds the index of the first "/" to determine the host's end, which is 8.
    - Finally, it returns the substring from the beginning to the host's end, resulting in "aaa.com".
4. The `temp` variable is assigned the value returned by `get_host()`, which is "aaa.com".
5. The `test()` method returns the value of `temp`.

<<<Output>>>
aaa.com
