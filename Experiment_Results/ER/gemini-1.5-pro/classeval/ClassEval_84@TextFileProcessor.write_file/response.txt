<<<Analysis>>>
Let's break down the execution of the `Test.test()` method step by step:

1. **Initialization:**
   - A list of file names `self.files` is created.
   - A list of file contents `self.contents` is created.
   - An instance of `TextFileProcessor` is created with the path `'test_1.txt'`.

2. **Writing to the File:**
   - `textFileProcessor.write_file(self.contents[0])` is called, which writes the content `'123aac\n&^(*&43)'` to the file 'test_1.txt'.

3. **Reading from the File:**
   - The code then opens the file 'test_1.txt' in read mode.
   - `data = f.read()` reads the entire content of the file into the `data` variable.

4. **Returning the Values:**
   - Finally, the function returns a tuple: `(data, self.contents[0])`.
   - `data` contains the content read from 'test_1.txt'.
   - `self.contents[0]` refers to the string `'123aac\n&^(*&43)'`.

<<<Output>>>
('123aac\n&^(*&43)', '123aac\n&^(*&43)')
