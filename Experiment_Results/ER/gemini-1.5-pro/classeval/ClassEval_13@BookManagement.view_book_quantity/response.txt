1. Inside the `test()` method, a `BookManagement` object is created and assigned to the variable `bookManagement`.
2. The `add_book` method is called on the `bookManagement` object with the arguments "book1" and 2. 
   - Inside the `add_book` method, since "book1" is not yet in the inventory, it's added to the `self.inventory` dictionary with a quantity of 2.
3. The `view_book_quantity` method is called on the `bookManagement` object with the argument "book1".
   - Inside the `view_book_quantity` method, since "book1" is present in the inventory, the quantity associated with "book1" (which is 2) is returned.
4. The `test()` method returns the value returned by `view_book_quantity`, which is 2.
