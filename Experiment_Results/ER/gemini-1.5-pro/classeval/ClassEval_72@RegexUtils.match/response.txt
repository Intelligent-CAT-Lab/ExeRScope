1. Inside the `Test.test()` method, a `RegexUtils` object is created and assigned to the variable `ru`.
2. The `ru.match(r'\b\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}\b', "1234567890")` method is called. This method checks if the given phone number string matches the pattern specified.
3. Inside the `match` method:
    - `re.match` tries to match the pattern `r'\b\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}\b'` with the input text `"1234567890"`. 
    - The pattern specifies a phone number format with three digits, a hyphen, three more digits, another hyphen, and then four digits. 
    - The input text does not match this pattern as it does not contain any hyphens.
    - Therefore, `re.match` returns None.
    - The `match` method then checks if `ans` (which is None) is truthy. Since it's not, it returns `False`.
4. The `False` value is then returned from the `Test.test()` method.
