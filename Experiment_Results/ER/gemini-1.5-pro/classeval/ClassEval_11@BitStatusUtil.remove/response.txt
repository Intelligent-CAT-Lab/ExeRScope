<<<Analysis>>>
1. **Initialization:** Inside the `test()` method, a `BitStatusUtil` object is created. However, this object is not used further since the called methods are static.
2. **Calling `remove()`:** The line `bit_status_util.remove(6, 2)` calls the static method `remove()` of the `BitStatusUtil` class with arguments `states = 6` and `stat = 2`.
3. **Inside `remove()`:**
   - **`check()` call:** It first calls the `check()` method to validate the input arguments.
   - **Validation:** The `check()` method verifies if both arguments are non-negative and even. In this case, both 6 and 2 satisfy the conditions, so no exception is raised.
   - **`has()` call:** Next, `BitStatusUtil.has(6, 2)` is called to check if `stat` (2) is present in `states` (6).
   - **Inside `has()`:**
     - **`check()` call:** It again calls `check()` for validation, which passes successfully.
     - **Bitwise AND:** The expression `(states & stat)` performs a bitwise AND operation between 6 (binary 110) and 2 (binary 010), resulting in 2 (binary 010).
     - **Comparison:** This result (2) is compared to `stat` (2). Since they are equal, `has()` returns `True`.
   - **Back in `remove()`:** Since `has()` returned `True`, the code proceeds to perform the bitwise XOR operation: `states ^ stat`, which is 6 (binary 110) XOR 2 (binary 010), resulting in 4 (binary 100).
   - **Return:** The `remove()` method returns the value 4.
4. **Final Return:** The `test()` method returns the value received from `remove()`, which is 4.
