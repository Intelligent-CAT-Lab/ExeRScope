<<<Analysis>>>
1. Inside the `test()` method, a `DataStatistics2` object is created with the list `[1, 2, 3, 4]` passed as data.
2. The `get_sum()` method is called on this `DataStatistics2` object.
3. Inside `get_sum()`, the `np.sum()` function calculates the sum of all elements in the `self.data` array, which is [1, 2, 3, 4].
4. The sum (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10) is returned by `get_sum()` and then by `test()`.

<<<Output>>>
10
