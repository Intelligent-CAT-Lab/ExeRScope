1. **Initialization:**
   - Two `EmailClient` objects are created:
     - `sender` with an address 'sender@example.com' and a capacity of 100.
     - `receiver` with an address 'receiver@example.com' and a capacity of 0.

2. **Sending Email (send_to method):**
   - The `send_to` method of the `sender` object is called with arguments:
     - `recv`: The `receiver` object.
     - `content`: The string 'Hello'.
     - `size`: The integer 10.

3. **Checking Receiver Capacity (is_full_with_one_more_email method):**
   - Inside `send_to`, it first checks if the receiver has enough capacity for the email using `recv.is_full_with_one_more_email(size)`.
   - `receiver.get_occupied_size()` is called, which returns 0 as the receiver's inbox is empty.
   - 0 (occupied size) + 10 (email size) is compared to 0 (receiver capacity). Since 10 > 0, `is_full_with_one_more_email` returns `True`.

4. **Clearing Sender's Inbox (clear_inbox method):**
   - As the receiver is full, `sender.clear_inbox(size)` is called. However, since the sender's inbox is also empty, this method doesn't delete any emails.

5. **Return False:**
   - Since the receiver's inbox is full and couldn't accommodate the new email, `send_to` returns `False`.

<<<Output>>>
False
