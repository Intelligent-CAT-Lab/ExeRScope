1. **Initialization**:
   - `self.db_name = "test.db"`: Sets up the database name.
   - `self.db = BookManagementDB(self.db_name)`: Creates an instance of `BookManagementDB`, which initializes a SQLite database connection and creates a table named "books" if it doesn't exist.

2. **Adding a Book**:
   - `self.db.add_book("Book to Borrow", "Jane Smith")`: Adds a book with the title "Book to Borrow" and author "Jane Smith" to the database. The book is initially marked as available. Since this is the first book, it gets the ID 1.

3. **Borrowing the Book**:
   - `self.db.borrow_book(1)`:  Calls the `borrow_book` method, which executes an SQL UPDATE statement to set the 'available' status of the book with ID 1 to 0 (unavailable).

4. **Checking Availability**:
   - `self.cursor.execute("SELECT available FROM books WHERE id=1")`: This line executes an SQL SELECT query to retrieve the 'available' status of the book with ID 1.
   - `result = self.cursor.fetchone()`: Fetches the result of the query, which is a tuple containing the 'available' value (0 in this case).
   - `return result[0]`: Returns the first element of the result tuple, which is the 'available' status (0).
