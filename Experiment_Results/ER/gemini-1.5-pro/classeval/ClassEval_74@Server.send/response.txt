<<<Analysis>>>
1. Inside the `test()` method, a new `Server` object is created and assigned to the variable `server`.
2. The `server.send()` method is called with a dictionary `{"content": "abc"}` as the argument.
3. Inside the `send()` method:
    - It checks if the input `info` is a dictionary, and if it has the keys "addr" and "content".
    - Since the input is missing the "addr" key, the condition fails.
    - The method returns the string "info structure is not correct".
4. Therefore, the `test()` method receives the string "info structure is not correct" as the return value from `server.send()`.
5. This string is assigned to the variable `flag`.
6. Finally, the `test()` method returns the value of `flag`, which is "info structure is not correct".

<<<Output>>>
info structure is not correct
