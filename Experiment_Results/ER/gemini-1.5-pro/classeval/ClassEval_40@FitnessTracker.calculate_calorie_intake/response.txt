<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method, a FitnessTracker object is created with height=1.72, weight=53, age=22, and sex="male".
Then, the calculate_calorie_intake() method is called on this object.
Inside calculate_calorie_intake():
1. It calculates BMR based on the sex. As sex is "male", BMR = 10 * 53 + 6.25 * 1.72 - 5 * 22 + 5 = 545.5.
2. It calls condition_judge() to determine the activity level.
    - Inside condition_judge():
        - It calculates BMI: 53 / 1.72 ** 2 = 17.93.
        - It determines BMI range for "male": [20, 25].
        - It compares BMI with the range and returns -1 (too thin).
3. Based on the returned value (-1), calorie_intake is calculated as BMR * 1.6 = 545.5 * 1.6 = 872.8.
Finally, the calculate_calorie_intake() method returns 872.8.
<<<Output>>>
872.8
