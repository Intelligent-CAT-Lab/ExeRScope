1. Inside the `test()` method, a `BookManagement` object is created and assigned to `self.bookManagement`.
2. `self.bookManagement.add_book("book1", 2)` is called, adding "book1" with quantity 2 to the inventory. Now the inventory is {"book1": 2}.
3. `self.bookManagement.add_book("book2")` is called, adding "book2" with quantity 1 to the inventory. Now the inventory is {"book1": 2, "book2": 1}.
4. `self.bookManagement.remove_book("book1", 2)` is called, removing 2 copies of "book1". Since the quantity of "book1" becomes 0, it's removed from the inventory. Now the inventory is {"book2": 1}.
5. Finally, `self.bookManagement.inventory` is returned, which represents the current state of the inventory.

<<<Output>>>
{'book2': 1}
