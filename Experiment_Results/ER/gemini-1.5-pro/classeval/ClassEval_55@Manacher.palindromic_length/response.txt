Inside the test() method, a Manacher object is created with the input string 'ababaxse'. Then, the palindromic_length method of the Manacher object is called with the following arguments:

* center = 2
* diff = 1
* string = 'a|b|a|b|a|x|s|e'

Let's analyze the execution of the palindromic_length method step-by-step:

1. **Initial call:** palindromic_length(2, 1, 'a|b|a|b|a|x|s|e')
   - center - diff = 1, center + diff = 3
   - string[1] == string[3] ('b' == 'b'), so the condition in the if statement is False.
   - The method returns: 1 + palindromic_length(2, 2, 'a|b|a|b|a|x|s|e')

2. **Recursive call 1:** palindromic_length(2, 2, 'a|b|a|b|a|x|s|e')
   - center - diff = 0, center + diff = 4
   - string[0] == string[4] ('a' == 'a'), so the condition in the if statement is False.
   - The method returns: 1 + palindromic_length(2, 3, 'a|b|a|b|a|x|s|e')

3. **Recursive call 2:** palindromic_length(2, 3, 'a|b|a|b|a|x|s|e')
   - center - diff = -1, center + diff = 5
   - The condition (center - diff == -1) in the if statement is True.
   - The method returns: 0

4. **Returning from recursive calls:**
   - Recursive call 2 returns 0 to Recursive call 1.
   - Recursive call 1 returns 1 + 0 = 1 to the initial call.

Therefore, the final value returned by the palindromic_length method is 1.
