The `test()` method tests the `prepare()` method of the `ExpressionCalculator` class. Let's break down how the code processes the input "2-3*4":

1. **Initialization:**
   - An instance of `ExpressionCalculator` is created. Inside this instance:
     - `postfix_stack` (a deque) is initialized as an empty deque: `deque([])`.
     - `operat_priority` is a list that defines operator precedence.

2. **Calling `prepare("2-3*4")`:**
   - The input expression "2-3*4" is passed to the `prepare()` method.

3. **Inside `prepare()`:**
   - `op_stack` is initialized as a deque with a comma: `deque([','])`.
   - The input expression is converted into a list of characters: `['2', '-', '3', '*', '4']`.
   - `current_index` is set to 0, and `count` is set to 0.
   - The code then iterates through each character in the expression:
     - **Iteration 1 (`2`):**
       - '2' is not an operator, so `count` is incremented to 1.
     - **Iteration 2 (`-`):**
       - '-' is an operator:
         - Since `count` is 1, "2" (from `current_index` to `current_index + count`) is appended to `postfix_stack`.
         - `current_op` is '-', and `peek_op` (top of `op_stack`) is ','.
         - The `while` loop condition inside the `else` block is not met (`-` has lower precedence than `,`), so '-' is pushed onto `op_stack`.
         - `count` is reset to 0, and `current_index` is updated to 2.
     - **Iteration 3 (`3`):**
       - '3' is not an operator, so `count` is incremented to 1.
     - **Iteration 4 (`*`):**
       - '*' is an operator:
         - Since `count` is 1, "3" is appended to `postfix_stack`.
         - `current_op` is '*', and `peek_op` is '-'.
         - The `while` loop condition is met (`*` has higher precedence than '-'), so '-' is popped from `op_stack` and appended to `postfix_stack`. Then '*' is pushed onto `op_stack`.
         - `count` is reset to 0, and `current_index` is updated to 4.
     - **Iteration 5 (`4`):**
       - '4' is not an operator, so `count` is incremented to 1.
   - After processing all characters:
     - `count` is 1, so "4" is appended to `postfix_stack`.
     - The `while` loop pops the remaining operator ('*') from `op_stack` and appends it to `postfix_stack`.

4. **Result:**
   - At the end of `prepare("2-3*4")`, the `postfix_stack` will contain: `deque(['2', '3', '4', '*', '-'])`.

5. **Return Value of `test()`:**
   - The `test()` method returns a tuple containing the current state of `self.expression_calculator.postfix_stack` and `deque(['2', '3', '4', '*', '-'])`.

<<<Output>>>
(deque(['2', '3', '4', '*', '-']), deque(['2', '3', '4', '*', '-']))
