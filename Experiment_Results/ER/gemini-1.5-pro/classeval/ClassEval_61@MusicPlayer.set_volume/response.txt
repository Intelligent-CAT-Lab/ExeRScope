<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method, a MusicPlayer object is created and assigned to the variable musicPlayer.
The set_volume(100) method is called on the musicPlayer object with the argument 100. 
Inside the set_volume() method, the volume is checked to be between 0 and 100. Because 100 is a valid value, the volume of the musicPlayer is set to 100.
The test() method then returns a tuple containing the return value of set_volume(100) (which is None because the method doesn't explicitly return anything) and the current value of musicPlayer.volume (which is now 100).
<<<Output>>>
(None, 100)
