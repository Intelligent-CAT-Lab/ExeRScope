<<<Analysis>>>
1. Inside the `test()` method, a `CookiesUtil` object is created with the cookies file set to 'cookies.json'.
2. The `cookies` attribute of the `CookiesUtil` object is then set to a dictionary containing key-value pairs for cookies. However, this step is irrelevant since the `load_cookies` method doesn't utilize this instance attribute.
3. The `load_cookies` method is called. Inside this method:
    - It attempts to open the file 'cookies.json' in read mode.
    - **Crucially, since the file 'cookies.json' does not exist, a `FileNotFoundError` is raised.**
    - This exception is caught, and the method returns an empty dictionary `{}`.
