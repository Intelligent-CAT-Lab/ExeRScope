<<<Analysis>>>
The `test()` method creates an instance of the `BigNumCalculator` class and then calls the `add` method with two large numbers as strings: '123456789012345678922' and '98765432109876543210'.

Let's break down the `add` method step-by-step:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `max_length`: Determines the length of the longest number (in this case, both are the same length).
   - `num1`, `num2`: Both input strings are padded with leading zeros to make their lengths equal to `max_length`.
   - `carry`: Initializes a carry variable to 0, used for handling overflows during addition.
   - `result`: An empty list to store the digits of the resulting sum.

2. **Iterating through Digits:**
   - The code iterates through the digits of the numbers from right to left using a `for` loop (`range(max_length - 1, -1, -1)`).

3. **Digit-by-Digit Addition:**
   - For each digit position `i`:
     - `digit_sum`: Calculates the sum of corresponding digits from `num1`, `num2`, and the `carry`.
     - `carry`: Updates the carry by dividing the `digit_sum` by 10, effectively moving the "tens" place to the next digit addition.
     - `digit`: Extracts the units digit of the `digit_sum` using the modulo operator (%).
     - `result.insert(0, str(digit))`: Inserts the calculated `digit` at the beginning of the `result` list.

4. **Handling Leading Carry:**
   - After processing all digits, if there's a remaining `carry` (i.e., `carry > 0`), it's inserted at the beginning of the `result` list.

5. **Joining the Result:**
   - Finally, the `result` list, containing individual digit strings, is joined into a single string using `''.join(result)`, which represents the sum of the two input numbers.

Therefore, the `add` method effectively performs string-based addition of two large numbers, handling carries appropriately.
