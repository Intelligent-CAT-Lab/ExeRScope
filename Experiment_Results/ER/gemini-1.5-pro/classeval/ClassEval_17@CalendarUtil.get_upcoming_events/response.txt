<<<Analysis>>>
1. Inside the `Test.test()` method, a `CalendarUtil` object is created and assigned to the variable `calendar`.
2. The `calendar.events` list is then populated with a single event dictionary. This dictionary represents an event on January 1, 2023, from 1:00 AM to 2:00 AM, with the description "New Year".
3. The `calendar.get_upcoming_events(1)` method is called with `num_events` set to 1. This method is designed to retrieve upcoming events from the `calendar.events` list.
4. Inside `get_upcoming_events()`, the current datetime is stored in the `now` variable.
5. The code then iterates through each event in `calendar.events`.
6. For each event, it checks if the event's start time (`event['start_time']`) is greater than or equal to the current time (`now`).
7. Since the example event's start time is in the past (January 1, 2023, 1:00 AM), it does not meet the condition `event['start_time'] >= now`.
8. As a result, the `upcoming_events` list remains empty.
9. The loop completes, and the `get_upcoming_events()` method returns the empty `upcoming_events` list.
