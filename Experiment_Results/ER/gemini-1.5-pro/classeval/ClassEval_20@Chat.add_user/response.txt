<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method:
1. We create an instance of the Chat class called `chat`.
2. We manually set the `users` attribute of the `chat` object to `{'John': []}`.
3. We call the `add_user` method on the `chat` object with the username 'Mary'. Since 'Mary' is not in the `chat.users` dictionary, the method adds 'Mary' as a key to the dictionary with an empty list as its value and returns True.
4. The return statement of the `test` method returns a tuple containing the return value of `chat.add_user('Mary')` which is True, and the updated `chat.users` dictionary. 

<<<Output>>>
(True, {'John': [], 'Mary': []})
