<<<Analysis>>>
1. Inside the `test()` method, an instance of the `AreaCalculator` class is created with `radius=2`.
2. The `calculate_cylinder_area` method is called on this instance with `height=2`.
3. Inside `calculate_cylinder_area`:
    - `self.radius` is `2` (from the instance).
    - `height` is `2` (passed as an argument).
    - The formula `2 * math.pi * self.radius * (self.radius + height)` is calculated, which is `2 * π * 2 * (2 + 2) = 16π`.
4. The result, `16π`, is returned.
