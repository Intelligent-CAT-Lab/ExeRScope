<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method, a VendingMachine object is created.
Then, the inventory attribute of the vendingMachine object is set to {'Coke': {'price': 1.25, 'quantity': 10}}.
Next, the balance attribute of the vendingMachine object is set to 0.
After that, vendingMachine.purchase_item('Coke') is called with the item_name 'Coke'. Since the item 'Coke' exists in the inventory and the balance is 0 which is less than the price of 'Coke', it returns False.
Finally, the return statement of the test() method returns a tuple containing the return value of vendingMachine.purchase_item('Coke') which is False, and the inventory of the vending machine which is {'Coke': {'price': 1.25, 'quantity': 10}}.
<<<Output>>>
(False, {'Coke': {'price': 1.25, 'quantity': 10}})
