Inside the test() method:
1. It calls the static method `MetricsCalculator2.mrr()` with the input `([0, 0, 0, 1], 4)`. This input is a tuple where the first element is a list representing relevance scores and the second element is the total number of relevant items.
2. Inside `MetricsCalculator2.mrr()`:
    - The input type is checked, and since it's a tuple, the code proceeds to the corresponding branch.
    - `sub_list` is assigned the numpy array `[0 0 0 1]`, and `total_num` is assigned the value `4`.
    - `ranking_array` is calculated as `[1.  0.5 0.33333333 0.25]`.
    - `mr_np` is calculated by multiplying `sub_list` and `ranking_array` element-wise, resulting in `[0.  0.  0.  0.25]`.
    - The code then iterates through `mr_np` and finds the first non-zero element, which is `0.25`. This value is assigned to `mr`.
    - Finally, the function returns `mr` (which is `0.25`) and `[mr]` (which is `[0.25]`).
3. Back in the `test()` method, `res1` receives the value `0.25` and `res2` receives the list `[0.25]`.
4. The `test()` method then returns `res1` and `res2`.

<<<Output>>>
(0.25, [0.25])
