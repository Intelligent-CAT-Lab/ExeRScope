<<<Analysis>>>
Let's break down the code execution step-by-step:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `self.cookies_util = CookiesUtil('cookies.json')`: A `CookiesUtil` object is created with the cookies file set to 'cookies.json'.
   - `self.cookies_util.cookies = {'cookies': {'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2'}}`: This line is immediately overwritten by the next assignment.
   - `self.cookies_util.cookies = {'cookies': {'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2'}, 'cookies2': {'key3': 'value3', 'key4': 'value4'}}`:  The `cookies` attribute of the `CookiesUtil` object is set to a dictionary containing two cookie sets.

2. **_save_cookies() Execution:**
   - The `_save_cookies()` method is called. Inside this method:
     - It opens the file 'cookies.json' in write mode (`'w'`).
     - It attempts to serialize the `self.cookies` dictionary into a JSON string and write it to the file.
     - If the saving is successful, it returns `True`. If any error occurs during the process (e.g., file not found, permission issue), it returns `False`.

3. **Return Value:**
   - Since the code doesn't present any apparent issues that would prevent writing to the file, the `_save_cookies()` method is expected to execute successfully.
