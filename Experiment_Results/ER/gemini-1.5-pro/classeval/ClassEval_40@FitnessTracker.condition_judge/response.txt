<<<Analysis>>>
1. **Initialization:** A `FitnessTracker` object is created with `height=1.8`, `weight=45`, `age=20`, and `sex="female"`.
2. **`test()` method call:** The `test()` method of the `Test` class is called, which in turn calls the `condition_judge()` method of the `FitnessTracker` object.
3. **`condition_judge()` method execution:**
   - It first calculates the BMI using `get_BMI()`, which returns `45 / 1.8 ** 2 = 13.89`.
   - Since the sex is "female", it retrieves the BMI range for females: `[19, 24]`.
   - It compares the calculated BMI (13.89) with the range. As 13.89 is less than 19, it falls under the "too thin" category.
   - Therefore, the method returns -1.
<<<Output>>>
-1
