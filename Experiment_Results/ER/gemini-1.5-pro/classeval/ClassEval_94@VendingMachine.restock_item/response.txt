<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method, a VendingMachine object is created and its inventory is initialized with 'Coke' and 'Pizza', both having a price of 1.25 and a quantity of 10.
The vendingMachine.restock_item('Pizza', 10) method is called, which attempts to restock 'Pizza' by adding 10 to its quantity.
Since 'Pizza' exists in the inventory, the quantity of 'Pizza' is increased by 10, resulting in a new quantity of 20.
The method then returns True to indicate successful restocking.
Finally, the return statement returns a tuple containing True (the result of restock_item) and the updated vendingMachine.inventory.
So the inventory will be {'Coke': {'price': 1.25, 'quantity': 10}, 'Pizza': {'price': 1.25, 'quantity': 20}}
<<<Output>>>
(True, {'Coke': {'price': 1.25, 'quantity': 10}, 'Pizza': {'price': 1.25, 'quantity': 20}})
