<<<Analysis>>>
The `test()` method instantiates a `MahjongConnect` object with a board size of 4x4 and a list of icons `['a', 'b', 'c']`. However, instead of using the randomly generated board, it overrides the `board` attribute with a predefined 4x4 matrix where all elements are 'a'.

Next, it calls the `remove_icons()` method with the positions (3, 0) and (2, 0). This method replaces the icons at the given positions with empty strings (' '). Therefore, the icons at positions (3, 0) and (2, 0) in the `board` matrix will be replaced with ' '.

Finally, the method returns the modified `board` matrix.

<<<Output>>>
[['a', 'b', 'c', 'a'], ['a', 'b', 'c', 'a'], ['a', 'b', 'c', 'a'], [' ', 'b', 'c', 'a']]
