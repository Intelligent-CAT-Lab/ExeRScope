<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method, an instance of the Lemmatization class is created as lemmatization.
Then, the get_pos_tag() method of the lemmatization object is called with the sentence "The dog's barked at the mailman." as input.
Inside the get_pos_tag() method:
1. The input sentence is first processed by the remove_punctuation() method to remove any punctuation marks. This results in the sentence: "The dogs barked at the mailman"
2. The word_tokenize() function from the nltk library is used to tokenize the sentence into individual words. This will result in a list of words: ['The', 'dogs', 'barked', 'at', 'the', 'mailman'].
3. The pos_tag() function from nltk is used to get the Part-of-Speech (POS) tags for each word in the tokenized list. This function returns a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the word and its corresponding POS tag.
4. The code then iterates through the list of tagged words and extracts the POS tag from each tuple, appending it to the pos_tags list.
5. Finally, the get_pos_tag() method returns the pos_tags list, which contains the POS tags for each word in the input sentence.
The test() method then returns a tuple containing the result (the list of POS tags) and the expected list of POS tags ['DT', 'NNS', 'VBD', 'IN', 'DT', 'NN'].
<<<Output>>>
(['DT', 'NNS', 'VBD', 'IN', 'DT', 'NN'], ['DT', 'NNS', 'VBD', 'IN', 'DT', 'NN'])
