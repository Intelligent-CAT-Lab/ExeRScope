<<<Analysis>>>
1. **Initialization:**
   - A `Hotel` object named `self.hotel` is created with the name 'Test Hotel' and the following available rooms:
     - `single`: 3 rooms
     - `double`: 2 rooms
     - `triple`: 2 rooms
2. **Booking a Room:**
   - The line `self.hotel.book_room('single', 3, 'guest 1')` attempts to book 3 single rooms for 'guest 1'.
   - Inside the `book_room` method:
     - It checks if 'single' room type exists in `available_rooms` (which it does).
     - It checks if 3 rooms are available (which they are).
     - It adds an entry to `booked_rooms`: `{'single': {'guest 1': 3}}`
     - It decreases the `available_rooms['single']` count by 3, making it 0.
     - It returns "Success!" (although this value is not used in the `test` method).
3. **Getting Available Rooms:**
   - The line `result = self.hotel.get_available_rooms('single')` calls the `get_available_rooms` method to retrieve the number of available single rooms.
   - This method simply returns the value of `self.available_rooms['single']`, which is now 0.
4. **Return Value:**
   - The `test` method returns the `result`, which is 0.
