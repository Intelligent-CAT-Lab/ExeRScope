<<<Analysis>>>
1. Inside the `test()` method, a new `SignInSystem` object is created and assigned to the variable `signin_system`.
2. The `add_user("ccc")` method is called on the `signin_system` object.
3. Inside the `add_user` method:
    - It checks if the username "ccc" exists in the `self.users` dictionary. Since the dictionary is empty, "ccc" is a new user.
    - A new key-value pair is added to the `self.users` dictionary with the key as "ccc" and the value as `False` (representing not signed in).
    - The method returns `True` to indicate the user was successfully added.
4. The `test()` method receives `True` from `add_user` and returns it.
