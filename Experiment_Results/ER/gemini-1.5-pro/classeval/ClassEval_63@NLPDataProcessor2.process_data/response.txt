<<<Analysis>>>
The `test()` method first creates an instance of the `NLPDataProcessor2` class and then initializes a list called `string_list` with two strings: "12345" and "Special@Characters". It then calls the `process_data()` method of the `NLPDataProcessor2` object with this `string_list`. Let's analyze what happens inside `process_data()`:

1. **Initialization:** An empty list called `words_list` is created to store the processed words.

2. **Iterating through the strings:** The code iterates through each string in the input `string_list`.

    - **For the first string "12345":**
        - `re.sub(r'[^a-zA-Z\s]', '', string.lower())` removes all non-alphabetic characters (which is everything in this case) and converts the string to lowercase, resulting in an empty string "".
        - This empty string is then split into words using `split()`, which results in an empty list `[]`.
        - This empty list is appended to `words_list`.

    - **For the second string "Special@Characters":**
        - `re.sub(r'[^a-zA-Z\s]', '', string.lower())` removes all non-alphabetic characters ("@" in this case) and converts the string to lowercase, resulting in "specialcharacters".
        - This string is then split into words using `split()`, resulting in a list `['specialcharacters']`.
        - This list is appended to `words_list`.

3. **Returning the processed list:** Finally, the `process_data()` method returns `words_list`, which now contains `[[], ['specialcharacters']]`.

Therefore, the `test()` method will return a tuple containing this `words_list` and the `expected_output`.

<<<Output>>>
([[], ['specialcharacters']], [[], ['specialcharacters']])
