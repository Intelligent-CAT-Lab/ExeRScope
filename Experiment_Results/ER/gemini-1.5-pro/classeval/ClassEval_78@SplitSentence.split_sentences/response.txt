<<<Analysis>>>
1. Inside the `test()` method of the `Test` class, an instance `ss` of the `SplitSentence` class is created.
2. Then, the method `split_sentences("Who is A.B.C.? He is a teacher.")` is called on the `ss` object.
3. Inside the `split_sentences` method:
    - The input string `"Who is A.B.C.? He is a teacher."` is split based on the regular expression `r'(?<!\w\.\w.)(?<![A-Z][a-z]\.)(?<=\.|\?)\s'`.
    - This regular expression is designed to split the string into sentences while handling cases like abbreviations (e.g., "A.B.C.") and ensuring sentences are split correctly at sentence boundaries.
    - The `re.split()` function splits the string based on the pattern defined in the regular expression.
4. The resulting split sentences are stored in the `sentences` variable.
5. The `sentences` list, which contains the split sentences, is returned by the `split_sentences` method.
6. Finally, the `test()` method returns the `sentences` list.

<<<Output>>>
['Who is A.B.C.?', 'He is a teacher.']
