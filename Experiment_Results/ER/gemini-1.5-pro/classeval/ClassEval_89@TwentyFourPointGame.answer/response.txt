<<<Analysis>>>
1. Inside the `test()` method, a new `TwentyFourPointGame` object is created and assigned to the variable `game`.
2. The `evaluate_expression()` method of the `game` object is called with the expression `'4*3+6+6'`.
3. Inside the `evaluate_expression()` method:
    - The code enters a `try` block.
    - The expression `'4*3+6+6'` is evaluated using `eval()`, resulting in `24`.
    - Since the evaluated result (`24`) is equal to `24`, the `if` condition (`eval(expression) == 24`) evaluates to `True`.
    - Therefore, the method returns `True`.
4. The `test()` method receives `True` as a return value from `game.evaluate_expression('4*3+6+6')` and returns it.
