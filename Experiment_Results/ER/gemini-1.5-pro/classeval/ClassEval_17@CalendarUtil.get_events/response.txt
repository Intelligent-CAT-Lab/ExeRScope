<<<Analysis>>>
1. Inside the `Test.test()` method, a `CalendarUtil` object is created and assigned to the variable `calendar`.
2. The `calendar.events` list is populated with a single event dictionary. This dictionary represents an event on January 1, 2023, from 00:00 to 01:00, with the description "New Year".
3. The `calendar.get_events()` method is called with the date `datetime(2023, 1, 1)` as input.
4. Inside the `get_events()` method:
   - An empty list `events_on_date` is created to store events matching the input date.
   - The code iterates through each event in `self.events`.
   - For each `event`, it compares the date of the event with the input date using `.date()`.
   - Since the event in `calendar.events` has the same date (January 1, 2023) as the input date, the event dictionary is appended to the `events_on_date` list.
5. The `get_events()` method returns the `events_on_date` list, which now contains the single "New Year" event dictionary.
<<<Output>>>
```python
[{'date': datetime.datetime(2023, 1, 1, 0, 0), 'start_time': datetime.datetime(2023, 1, 1, 0, 0), 'end_time': datetime.datetime(2023, 1, 1, 1, 0), 'description': 'New Year'}]
```
