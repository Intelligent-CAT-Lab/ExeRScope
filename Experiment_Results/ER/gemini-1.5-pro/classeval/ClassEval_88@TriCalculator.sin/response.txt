<<<Analysis>>>
1. Inside the `test()` method, a `TriCalculator` object is created.
2. The `sin(0)` method of the `tricalculator` object is called.
3. Inside the `sin()` method:
    - `x` is initialized to 0 and converted to radians: `x = 0 / 180 * pi = 0`.
    - Variables `g` and `t` are initialized to 0 and `x` (which is 0) respectively.
    - The while loop condition `fabs(t) >= 1e-15` is immediately false because `t` is 0.
    - Therefore, the loop doesn't execute, and the method returns the initial value of `g`, which is 0.
4. The `test()` method returns the value returned by `tricalculator.sin(0)`, which is 0.
