<<<Analysis>>>
Let's break down the execution of the `Test.test()` method step by step:

1. **Setup:**
   - `self.file_path = "test_example.docx"`: Sets the file path for the document.
   - `self.handler = DocFileHandler(self.file_path)`: Creates a `DocFileHandler` object, associating it with the specified file.
   - A new document is created using `doc = Document()`.
   - An initial paragraph with the text "Initial content" is added to the document.
   - The document is saved to the defined file path.

2. **Adding a Heading:**
   - `heading = "Test Heading 3"`: Assigns the string "Test Heading 3" to the variable `heading`.
   - `self.handler.add_heading(heading)`: Calls the `add_heading` method of the `DocFileHandler` object. 
     - Inside `add_heading`:
       - It opens the document at `self.file_path`.
       - It adds a heading with the text from the `heading` variable ("Test Heading 3") using the default level 1.
       - It saves the modified document.

3. **Retrieving Headings:**
   - `doc = Document(self.file_path)`: The document at `self.file_path` is opened again.
   - `headings = [p.text for p in doc.paragraphs if p.style.name.startswith('Heading')]`: This list comprehension extracts the text of all paragraphs in the document whose style name starts with "Heading" and stores them in the `headings` list.

4. **Return Values:**
   - The `test` method returns a tuple: `(heading, headings)`.
   - `heading` contains the string "Test Heading 3".
   - `headings` will likely contain a single element, which is also "Test Heading 3", as only one heading was added.
