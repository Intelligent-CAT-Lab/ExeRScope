<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method, an instance of the BlackjackGame class is created. During the initialization of BlackjackGame:
1. The __init__ method is called, which initializes two empty lists: player_hand and dealer_hand.
2. The __init__ method then calls the create_deck() method.
3. The create_deck() method initializes an empty list called deck.
4. It then iterates through each suit and rank, creating a card string (e.g., 'AS', '2D', '10H') and appending it to the deck list.
5. The random.shuffle() method is called to shuffle the deck randomly.
6. Finally, the create_deck() method returns the shuffled deck, which is assigned to the self.deck attribute of the BlackjackGame instance.
7. The test() method then accesses the self.deck attribute of the BlackjackGame instance and assigns it to the variable self.deck.
8. Finally, the len(self.deck) is returned, which represents the number of cards in the deck. Since a standard deck of cards has 52 cards, the length of self.deck will be 52.
