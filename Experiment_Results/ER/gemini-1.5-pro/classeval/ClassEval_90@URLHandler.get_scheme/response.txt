Inside the test() method:
1. It creates an instance of the URLHandler class with the URL "https://www.bing.com/search?pglt=41&q=humaneval&cvid=4dc2da2bb4bc429eb498c85245ae5253&aqs=edge.0.0l7j69i61j69i60.10008j0j1&FORM=ANNTA1&PC=U531&mkt=zh-CN".
2. Then it calls the get_scheme() method on this instance.
3. Inside the get_scheme() method:
    - It finds the index of "://" in the URL, which is 5 in this case.
    - It then returns the substring from the beginning of the URL up to but not including the index of "://", which is "https".
Therefore the test() method will return "https".
<<<Output>>>
https
