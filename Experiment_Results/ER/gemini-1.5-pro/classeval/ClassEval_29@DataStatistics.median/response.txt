<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method, a DataStatistics object `ds` is created. Then, the median method of this object is called with the input data [2, 5, 1, 3, 4].

Let's break down the median method:

1. **Sorting:** The input list `data` is sorted in ascending order: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
2. **Length:** The length `n` of the sorted list is calculated, which is 5 in this case.
3. **Odd Check:** Since `n` is odd (5 % 2 != 0), the code enters the `else` block.
4. **Middle Index:** The middle index is calculated as `n // 2`, which is 2.
5. **Return Median:** The element at the middle index (2) of the sorted list is returned. In this case, `sorted_data[2]` is 3.

Therefore, the `median` method will return 3.
