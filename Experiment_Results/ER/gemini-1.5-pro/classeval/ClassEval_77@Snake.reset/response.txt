<<<Analysis>>>
We first create an instance of the Snake class with the following initial values:

- SCREEN_WIDTH = 100
- SCREEN_HEIGHT = 100
- BLOCK_SIZE = 1
- food_position = (51, 51)

Initially, the snake has:
- length = 1
- positions = [(50, 50)]  (center of the screen)
- score = 0

1. `snake.move((-1, 0))`: This moves the snake one unit to the left. 
    - The new head position is calculated as (50 - 1, 50) = (49, 50).
    - Since the new position is not the food position and the snake doesn't collide with itself, the snake simply moves to this new position.
    - The snake's positions are now [(49, 50), (50, 50)] 

2. `snake.reset()`: This method resets the snake to its initial state:
    - length is set back to 1
    - positions is set back to [(50, 50)]
    - score is set back to 0
    - A new random food position is generated. However, this is irrelevant in this test case as we are only interested in the snake's length, position, and score.

Finally, the function returns the following values:
- `snake.length`: This will be 1, as the snake's length was reset.
- `snake.positions[0]`: This will be (50, 50), as the snake's position was reset to the center of the screen.
- `snake.score`: This will be 0, as the snake's score was reset.

<<<Output>>>
(1, (50, 50), 0)
