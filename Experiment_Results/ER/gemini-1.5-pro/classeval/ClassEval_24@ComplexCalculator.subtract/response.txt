<<<Analysis>>>
1. Inside the `Test.test()` method, a new `ComplexCalculator` object is created, but it's not used in the subsequent calculation.
2. The `ComplexCalculator.subtract()` static method is called with two complex numbers: `(1 + 2j)` and `(3 + 4j)`.
3. Inside `subtract()`:
    - `c1.real` (1) is subtracted from `c2.real` (3), resulting in `-2`.
    - `c1.imag` (2) is subtracted from `c2.imag` (4), resulting in `-2`.
4. The `subtract()` method returns a new complex number `complex(-2, -2)`, which represents `-2 - 2j`.

<<<Output>>>
(-2-2j)
