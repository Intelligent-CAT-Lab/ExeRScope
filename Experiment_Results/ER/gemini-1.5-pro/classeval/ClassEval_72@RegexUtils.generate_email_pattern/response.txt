<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method:
1. An instance of the RegexUtils class is created as 'ru'.
2. The generate_email_pattern() method of the 'ru' object is called, which returns a regular expression pattern for matching email addresses and assigns it to the variable 'pat'.
3. The match() method of the 'ru' object is called with 'pat' (the email pattern) and 'iustd87t2euh@163.com' as arguments.
4. Inside the match() method, the re.match() function attempts to match the given pattern 'pat' with the input text 'iustd87t2euh@163.com' from the beginning of the string.
5. Since the input text is a valid email address and matches the pattern, re.match() returns a match object, which satisfies the if condition in the match() method.
6. Therefore, the match() method returns True.
7. Consequently, the test() method returns True, which is assigned to the variable 'res'.
