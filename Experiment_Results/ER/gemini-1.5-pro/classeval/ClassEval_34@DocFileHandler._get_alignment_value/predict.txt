Due to the incomplete and potentially erroneous parts related to heading verification and file removal, providing a precise output is not feasible without adjustments to the code. 

However, based on the analysis, the output structure would be a tuple with the following types of values:

```
('New content 1', 'Initial content', 'New content 1', 'New content 1', 'Test Heading 1', [...], 1, 2) 
```

- The first four elements are strings as explained above.
- The fifth element is a list (potentially empty or incomplete due to the code issue).
- The last two elements are integers representing the table's rows and columns.
