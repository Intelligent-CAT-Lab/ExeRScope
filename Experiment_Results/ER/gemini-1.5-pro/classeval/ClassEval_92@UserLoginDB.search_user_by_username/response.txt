<<<Analysis>>>
Let's break down the execution of the `Test.test()` method step by step:

1. **Database Setup:**
   - A temporary database file (`test_db.db`) is created.
   - A connection to the database is established.
   - A table named "users" is created with columns for "username" and "password".

2. **User Insertion:**
   - An instance of `UserLoginDB` is created, connected to the temporary database.
   - The `insert_user` method is called to insert a user with username 'user3' and password 'pass3' into the database.

3. **User Retrieval:**
   - The `search_user_by_username` method is called with the username 'user3'.
   - The database is queried for a user with the given username.
   - The query result, which should be a tuple representing the user record ('user3', 'pass3'), is stored in the `user` variable.

4. **Return Values:**
   - The `test` method returns three values:
     - `user`: The complete user tuple fetched from the database.
     - `user[0]`: The first element of the `user` tuple, which is the username ('user3').
     - `user[1]`: The second element of the `user` tuple, which is the password ('pass3').

<<<Output>>>
(('user3', 'pass3'), 'user3', 'pass3')
