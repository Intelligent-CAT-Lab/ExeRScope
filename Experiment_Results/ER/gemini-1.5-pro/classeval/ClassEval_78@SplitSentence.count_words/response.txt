<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method:
1. An instance of the SplitSentence class is created as 'ss'.
2. The count_words() method of the 'ss' object is called with the string "abc def bbb1" as an argument, and the return value is stored in the 'cnt' variable.
3. Inside the count_words() method:
    - The input string "abc def bbb1" is first processed by the re.sub() method to remove non-alphanumeric characters except spaces, resulting in "abc def bbb1" (no change in this case).
    - The modified string is then split into a list of words using the split() method: ["abc", "def", "bbb1"].
    - The len() function calculates the length of this list, which is 3, and returns this value.
4. The test() method returns the value of 'cnt', which is 3.
