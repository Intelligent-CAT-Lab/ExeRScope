1.  **Inside `Test.test()`:**

    *   An instance of the `JSONProcessor` class is created as `self.processor`.
    *   A dictionary `self.test_data` is created for testing purposes.
    *   A file path `self.file_path` is defined as "test.json".
    *   Another file path `self.file_path_only_read` is defined as "test\_only\_read.json".
    *   The code opens the "test\_only\_read.json" file in write mode ('w') and writes a JSON string '{"key1": "value1"}' to it.
    *   The code changes the permissions of "test\_only\_read.json" to read-only using `os.chmod(self.file_path_only_read, stat.S_IRUSR + stat.S_IRGRP + stat.S_IROTH)`.
    *   The `write_json` method of the `self.processor` object is called with `self.test_data` and `self.file_path_only_read` as arguments. This attempts to write the data to the read-only file.
2.  **Inside `JSONProcessor.write_json()`:**

    *   The method attempts to open the provided file path (`self.file_path_only_read`, which is read-only) in write mode ('w').
    *   Since the file is read-only, an exception will occur during the attempt to open it for writing.
    *   The code enters the `except` block and returns -1, indicating an error during the write operation.
