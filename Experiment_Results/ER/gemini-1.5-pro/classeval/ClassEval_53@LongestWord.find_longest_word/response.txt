<<<Analysis>>>
1. **Initialization:**
   - A `LongestWord` object is created and assigned to the variable `longestWord`.
   - The word "a" is added to the `word_list` of the `longestWord` object.
   - The sentence `'I am a student.'` is assigned to the variable `sentence`.

2. **`find_longest_word()` method execution:**
   - The `find_longest_word()` method of the `longestWord` object is called with `sentence` as input.
   - Inside the method:
     - `longest_word` is initialized as an empty string.
     - The input `sentence` is converted to lowercase: `'i am a student.'`
     - Punctuation is removed from `sentence`: `'i am a student'`
     - `sentence` is split into a list of words: `['i', 'am', 'a', 'student']`
     - The code iterates through each `word` in the `sentence` list:
       - For each `word`, it checks if the word exists in `word_list` and if its length is greater than the current `longest_word`.
       - If both conditions are true, the `longest_word` is updated with the current `word`. 
     - Since "a" is present in `word_list` and it is longer than the initial empty string, `longest_word` is updated to "a".

3. **Return Value:**
   - The method returns the `longest_word`, which is "a".

<<<Output>>>
a
