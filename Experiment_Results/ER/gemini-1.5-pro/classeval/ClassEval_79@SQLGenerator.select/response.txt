<<<Analysis>>>
1. Inside the `test()` method, a `SQLGenerator` object is created with the table name 'table1'.
2. The `select()` method of the `sql` object is called with two arguments:
    - `fields`: a list containing one element, 'field1'.
    - `condition`: a string "field2 = value1, field3 = value2".
3. Inside the `select()` method:
    - The `fields` variable is assigned the value 'field1' as it's not None.
    - The `sql` variable is initialized with the string "SELECT field1 FROM table1".
    - Since `condition` is not None, the string " WHERE field2 = value1, field3 = value2" is appended to the `sql` string.
    - Finally, the method returns the `sql` string with a semicolon appended: "SELECT field1 FROM table1 WHERE field2 = value1, field3 = value2;".
4. The `test()` method returns the result of the `select()` method.

<<<Output>>>
SELECT field1 FROM table1 WHERE field2 = value1, field3 = value2;
