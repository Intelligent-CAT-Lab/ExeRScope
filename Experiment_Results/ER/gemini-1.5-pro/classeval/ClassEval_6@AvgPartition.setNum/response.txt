<<<Analysis>>>
1. Inside the `Test.test()` method, an instance of the `AvgPartition` class is created with the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and limit `2`.
2. The `setNum()` method is called on this instance.
3. Inside `setNum()`:
    - `size` is calculated as the length of the list (5) floor divided by the limit (2), resulting in `size = 2`.
    - `remainder` is calculated as the length of the list (5) modulo the limit (2), resulting in `remainder = 1`.
    - The method returns a tuple `(size, remainder)`, which is `(2, 1)` in this case.
4. Therefore, `Test.test()` will return the tuple `(2, 1)`.

<<<Output>>>
(2, 1)
