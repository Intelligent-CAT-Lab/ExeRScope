<<<Analysis>>>
1. **Initialization:**
   - An instance of `ExpressionCalculator` is created. Inside the constructor:
     - `postfix_stack` (a deque) is initialized, which will be used to store the expression in postfix notation.
     - `operat_priority` (a list) is initialized, defining the precedence of operators.

2. **Calculate Function Call:**
   - The `calculate("2 * 3 * 4")` method is called with the input expression.

3. **Transform Function:**
   - The `transform` method preprocesses the expression:
     - Removes whitespace: `"2 * 3 * 4"` becomes `"2*3*4"`.
     - Removes trailing '=': (No effect in this case).
     - Handles unary minus: (No effect in this case).
     - Returns the modified expression: `"2*3*4"`.

4. **Prepare Function:**
   - The `prepare` method converts the infix expression to postfix:
     - Initializes an empty operator stack (`op_stack`) and a counter (`count`).
     - Iterates through each character in the expression:
       - If it's an operand (number), it's appended directly to `postfix_stack`.
       - If it's an operator:
         - The operator is pushed onto `op_stack` based on its precedence.
         - If an operator with higher or equal precedence is already on the stack, it's popped and added to `postfix_stack` before pushing the current operator.
     - After processing all characters, any remaining operators in `op_stack` are popped and added to `postfix_stack`.
   - For the input `"2*3*4"`, the `postfix_stack` would contain: `['2', '3', '*', '4', '*']`.

5. **Calculation Loop:**
   - The `calculate` method then proceeds with the calculation:
     - It reverses the `postfix_stack` to: `['*', '4', '*', '3', '2']`.
     - It iterates through the `postfix_stack`:
       - If the element is an operand, it's pushed onto the `result_stack`.
       - If the element is an operator:
         - Two operands are popped from `result_stack`.
         - The operation is performed using the `_calculate` method.
         - The result is appended back to `result_stack`.

6. **Result:**
   - After processing the entire `postfix_stack`, the `result_stack` would contain a single element, which is the final result of the expression.
   - The `calculate` method returns this result as a float.
