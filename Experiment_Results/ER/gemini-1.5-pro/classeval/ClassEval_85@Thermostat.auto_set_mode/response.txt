<<<Analysis>>>
1. Inside the `test()` method, a `Thermostat` object `t` is created with `current_temperature = 25`, `target_temperature = 25`, and `mode = 'cool'`.
2. The `auto_set_mode()` method is called on the `t` object. 
3. Inside `auto_set_mode()`, since `self.current_temperature` (25) is not less than `self.target_temperature` (25), the `else` block is executed, setting `self.mode` to `'cool'`.
4. Finally, `t.get_mode()` is called, which simply returns the current value of `self.mode`.

<<<Output>>>
cool
