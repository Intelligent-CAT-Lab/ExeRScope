1. **Initialization**: 
   - A `BalancedBrackets` object `b` is created with the expression "a(b{c]]".
   - Inside the constructor:
     - `self.stack` is initialized as an empty list to store left brackets encountered.
     - `self.left_brackets` is initialized with left bracket characters: ["(", "{", "["].
     - `self.right_brackets` is initialized with right bracket characters: [")", "}", "]"].
     - `self.expr` is set to the input expression "a(b{c]]".

2. **`check_balanced_brackets()` Execution**:
   - **`clear_expr()` Call**:
     - The `clear_expr()` method is called. It removes any characters from `self.expr` that are not brackets, resulting in `self.expr` becoming "({]]".
   - **Looping through the Expression**:
     - The `for` loop iterates through each character (`Brkt`) in the cleaned expression "({]]".
       - **Iteration 1 (`(`)**: 
         - `Brkt` is "(", which is in `self.left_brackets`.
         - "(" is pushed onto the `self.stack`.
       - **Iteration 2 (`{`):**
         - `Brkt` is "{", which is in `self.left_brackets`.
         - "{" is pushed onto the `self.stack`.
       - **Iteration 3 (`]`)**:
         - `Brkt` is "]", which is in `self.right_brackets`.
         - `Current_Brkt` is popped from `self.stack`, which is "{".
         - The code checks if `Current_Brkt` ("{") matches the closing bracket "]". It does not, so the function returns `False`.

3. **Return Value**:
   - The `check_balanced_brackets()` method returns `False` because the brackets are not balanced.
