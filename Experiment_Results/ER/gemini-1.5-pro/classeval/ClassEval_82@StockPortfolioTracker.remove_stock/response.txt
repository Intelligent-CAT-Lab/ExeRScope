<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method, a StockPortfolioTracker object is created with an initial cash balance of 10000.0.
Then, two stocks 'AAPL' and 'MSFT' are added to the portfolio with price 150.0 and quantity 10.
The remove_stock method is called to remove 10 quantities of 'AAPL' stock. 
Inside the remove_stock() method:
    - It iterates through the portfolio to find a matching stock name and sufficient quantity.
    - If found, it reduces the stock quantity.
    - If the quantity becomes zero, it removes the stock from the portfolio and returns True.
    - In this case, it finds 'AAPL' with 10 quantity, removes it as quantity becomes 0 and returns True.
Finally the test() method returns the returned value of remove_stock() method and the updated portfolio.
<<<Output>>>
(True, [{'name': 'MSFT', 'price': 150.0, 'quantity': 10}])
