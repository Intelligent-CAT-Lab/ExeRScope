<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method:
1. We define a customer with name 'John Doe' and fidelity 1800.
2. We define a cart with two products and their quantities and prices.
3. We create an order object of the DiscountStrategy class and pass the customer, cart and the FidelityPromo as promotion strategy.
4. We set the expected discount to 12.5.
5. We call the promotion method of the order object and store it in actual_discount. This will in turn invoke the FidelityPromo static method.
6. Inside FidelityPromo, we check if customer's fidelity is greater than or equal to 1000. If yes, we return 5% of the total order value as discount, otherwise 0.
7. The total order value is calculated as the sum of product of quantity and price of each item in the cart, which is (10 * 20.0) + (5 * 10.0) = 250.0
8. Since the customer's fidelity is 1800 (greater than 1000), a discount of 5% of 250.0 is calculated which is 12.5.
9. Finally the test() method returns a tuple containing the actual discount (12.5) and the expected discount (12.5).
<<<Output>>>
(12.5, 12.5)
