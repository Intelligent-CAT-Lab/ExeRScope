<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method, an instance of the HRManagementSystem class is created as hr_system.
1. The first line inside the test() method assigns a dictionary to hr_system.employees. This dictionary contains information about two employees with IDs 1 and 2.
2. The second line reassigns hr_system.employees to a new dictionary containing information for only one employee with ID 1. The information for employee 2 is overwritten.
3. hr_system.list_employees() is called twice, and both return values are returned as a tuple. Since the second assignment overwrites the first one, both calls to list_employees() will consider the same employee data (only employee with ID 1).

<<<Output>>>
({1: {'employee_ID': 1, 'name': 'John', 'position': 'Manager', 'department': 'Sales', 'salary': 100000}}, {1: {'employee_ID': 1, 'name': 'John', 'position': 'Manager', 'department': 'Sales', 'salary': 100000}})
