<<<Analysis>>>
1. Inside the `test()` method, a `DataStatistics` object `ds` is created. 
2. Then, the `mean()` method of the `ds` object is called with the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` as input.
3. Inside the `mean()` method:
    - `sum(data)` calculates the sum of the elements in the input list (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15).
    - `len(data)` calculates the number of elements in the input list (5).
    - The sum is divided by the length (15 / 5 = 3).
    - The result is rounded to 2 decimal places using `round(3, 2)`, which remains 3.
4. The `mean()` method returns the calculated mean, which is 3.
5. The `test()` method returns the value returned by `ds.mean()`, which is 3.
