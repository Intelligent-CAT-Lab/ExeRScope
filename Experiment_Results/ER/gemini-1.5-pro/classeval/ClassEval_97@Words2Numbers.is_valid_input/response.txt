<<<Analysis>>>
1. **Initialization:**
   - Inside the `test()` method, a `Words2Numbers` object is created and assigned to the variable `w2n`.
   - This initializes the dictionaries and lists within the `Words2Numbers` class to handle number conversions.

2. **Input Processing:**
   - The input string `'fifteenth hundred'` is passed to the `is_valid_input` method of the `w2n` object.
   - Inside `is_valid_input`, the input string is first split into individual words: `['fifteenth', 'hundred']`.

3. **Word Validation:**
   - The code iterates through each word:
     - **'fifteenth':**
       - The word ends with "th", so it's processed by the `ordinal_endings` replacement logic.
       - 'fifteenth' becomes 'fifty', which is a valid key in the `self.numwords` dictionary.
     - **'hundred':**
       - This word is also a valid key in the `self.numwords` dictionary.

4. **Result:**
   - Since all words in the input string are either valid ordinal words or found in `self.numwords`, the `is_valid_input` method returns `True`.

<<<Output>>>
True
