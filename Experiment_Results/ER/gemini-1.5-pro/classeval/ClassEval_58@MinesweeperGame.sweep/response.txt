<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method, a MinesweeperGame object is created with n = 3 and k = 1. This initializes a 3x3 minesweeper game with 1 mine.
The minesweeper_map and player_map are then manually set to specific states.
minesweeper_map represents the underlying game board with the mine ('X') and its neighboring counts.
player_map represents what the player currently sees ('-' for unrevealed squares).
The sweep(0, 0) method is called, attempting to reveal the top-left corner of the board.
Inside the sweep() method:
The conditional statement (self.minesweeper_map[x][y] == 'X') checks if the selected cell contains a mine. Since minesweeper_map[0][0] is 'X', the condition is True.
Therefore, the function returns False, indicating that the player hit a mine.
The return statement of the test() method then returns False and the current score of the game which is 0.
<<<Output>>>
(False, 0)
