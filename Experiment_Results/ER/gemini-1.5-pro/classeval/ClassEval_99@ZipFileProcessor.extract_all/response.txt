<<<Analysis>>>
Let's break down the code execution step by step:

1. **Setup:**
   - A `test_folder` directory is created (or it's confirmed to exist).
   - Inside `test_folder`, a file named `example1.txt` is created with the content "This is an example file."
   - A zip file named `example.zip` is created, containing `example1.txt`.

2. **ZipFileProcessor Initialization:**
   - An instance of `ZipFileProcessor` is created with the filename `example.zip`.

3. **Extraction:**
   - The `extract_all` method of the `processor` object is called with `output_directory` as the destination for extraction.
   - Inside `extract_all`:
     - The `example.zip` file is opened in read mode.
     - All its contents are extracted to the `output_directory`.
     - The method returns `True` since the extraction was successful.

4. **Cleanup:**
   - `example.zip`, `example1.txt`, and `test_folder` are deleted.

5. **Return Value:**
   - The `test` method returns a tuple:
     - The first element is the value of the `success` variable, which is `True`.
     - The second element checks if 'example1.txt' exists in the 'output_directory'. Since the file was extracted and the cleanup happened afterward, this will be `True`.

(True, True)
