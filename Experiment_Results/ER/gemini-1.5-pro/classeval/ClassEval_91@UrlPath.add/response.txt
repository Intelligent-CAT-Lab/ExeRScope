<<<Analysis>>>
1. Inside the `test()` method, a `UrlPath` object is created using `url_path = UrlPath()`.
2. The `add()` method of the `url_path` object is called with the argument `'123'`.
3. Inside the `add()` method:
    - The `fix_path()` method is called with the segment `'123'`.
    - The `fix_path()` method, in this case, simply returns the input segment `'123'` as it's not empty and doesn't have leading/trailing slashes.
    - The returned segment `'123'` is then appended to the `segments` list of the `url_path` object.
4. Finally, the `test()` method returns the `segments` list of the `url_path` object. 

Therefore, the `segments` list will contain a single element, `'123'`.

<<<Output>>>
['123']
