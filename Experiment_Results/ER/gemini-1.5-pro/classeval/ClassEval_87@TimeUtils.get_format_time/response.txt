<<<Analysis>>>
1. Inside the `test()` method, a `TimeUtils` object is created and assigned to the variable `timeutils`.
2. The `get_format_time()` method of the `timeutils` object is called with the arguments `2001`, `7`, `16`, `1`, `1`, and `1`, representing the year, month, day, hour, minute, and second respectively.
3. Inside the `get_format_time()` method:
    - A format string `"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"` is defined.
    - A `datetime.datetime` object is created with the given year, month, day, hour, minute, and second, representing July 16, 2001, at 01:01:01.
    - The `strftime()` method is called on the `datetime.datetime` object with the defined format string to format the date and time as "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS".
    - The formatted date and time string is returned.
4. The `test()` method returns the formatted date and time string returned by the `get_format_time()` method.
