<<<Analysis>>>
1. Inside the `Test.test()` method, a `URLHandler` object is created with the URL "https://www.baidu.com/s?wd=aaa&rsv_spt=1#bbb".
2. The `get_fragment()` method of the `urlhandler` object is called.
3. Inside the `get_fragment()` method:
    - It first tries to find the index of '#' in the URL. In this case it's 29.
    - If '#' is found, it returns the substring of the URL starting from the next character of '#' to the end.
    - In this case, the substring from index 30 till the end is "bbb".
4. So the `get_fragment()` method will return "bbb".
5. The `test()` method returns the value returned by `get_fragment()`, which is "bbb".
<<<Output>>>
bbb
