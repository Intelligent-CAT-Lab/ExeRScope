<<<Analysis>>>
1. **Initialization:** An instance of the `ShoppingCart` class is created as `shoppingcart`. Its `items` attribute is initialized as an empty dictionary.
2. **Adding Items:**
   - `shoppingcart.add_item("apple", 1, 1)`:  "apple" is added to the cart with a price of 1 and quantity of 1. Since it's a new item, it's added to the `items` dictionary.
   - `shoppingcart.add_item("banana", 2, 1)`: Similarly, "banana" is added with a price of 2 and quantity of 1.
3. **Calculating Total Price:**
   - `shoppingcart.total_price()`: This method is called to calculate the total price of items in the cart.
   - Inside `total_price()`:
     - It iterates through each item in the `self.items.values()` (which are dictionaries containing 'price' and 'quantity').
     - For each item, it calculates `item['quantity'] * item['price']` (quantity multiplied by price).
     - The `sum()` function then adds up all these individual item prices.
     - In this case: (1 * 1) + (1 * 2) = 3
4. **Return Value:** The `total_price()` method returns the calculated total price, which is 3.
