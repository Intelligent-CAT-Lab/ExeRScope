<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method, an instance of the HtmlUtil class is created as 'htmlutil'. Then, the extract_code_from_html_text() method of this instance is called with a multi-line string containing HTML code as input. Let's break down what happens inside this method:

1. **format_line_html_text() call:**
   - The input HTML text is first passed to the format_line_html_text() method. This method aims to clean up and format the HTML text.
   - Inside format_line_html_text(), the HTML content is parsed using BeautifulSoup.
   - It specifically targets 'pre' and 'blockquote' tags, replacing their content with the " -CODE- " mark.
   - It also formats lists (ul and ol) by adding "[â€“]" and "." to list items.
   - Finally, it cleans the text, decodes HTML entities, and formats line feeds.

2. **Checking for Code Mark:**
   - After processing by format_line_html_text(), the code checks if the " -CODE- " mark is present in the formatted text. If not, it means no code blocks were found and an empty list is returned.

3. **Extracting Code:**
   - If the " -CODE- " mark exists, the code proceeds to extract the actual code snippets.
   - It finds all 'pre' and 'blockquote' tags within the original HTML.
   - It iterates through these tags and retrieves the text content of each tag, which now represents the extracted code.
   - These code snippets are appended to the 'code_list'.

4. **Returning the Code List:**
   - Finally, the 'code_list', containing the extracted code snippets, is returned.

Therefore, the 'res' variable in test() will hold a list of code snippets extracted from the provided HTML.

<<<Output>>>
```python
["print('Hello, world!')", '<code>for i in range(2):\n                    print(i)</code>']
```
