<<<Analysis>>>
1. Inside the test() method, a Warehouse object is created called warehouse.
2. warehouse.add_product(1, 'product 1', 10) is called:
    - Since the product ID 1 does not exist in the inventory, a new entry is created with the given name and quantity.
    - The inventory becomes: {1: {'name': 'product 1', 'quantity': 10}}
3. warehouse.update_product_quantity(1, 5) is called:
    - The product with ID 1 is found in the inventory.
    - Its quantity is increased by 5: 10 + 5 = 15
    - The inventory becomes: {1: {'name': 'product 1', 'quantity': 15}}
4. Finally, warehouse.inventory is returned, which is {1: {'name': 'product 1', 'quantity': 15}}.
<<<Output>>>
{1: {'name': 'product 1', 'quantity': 15}}
