<<<Analysis>>>
1. Inside the `test()` method, a `MusicPlayer` object is created.
2. The playlist is initialized with three songs: "song1", "song2", and "song3".
3. The `current_song` is set to "song3".
4. The `switch_song()` method is called. 
5. Since `current_song` is not None, the code enters the first if block within `switch_song()`.
6. The `current_index` is determined to be 2 (the index of "song3" in the playlist).
7. The if condition `current_index < len(self.playlist) - 1` evaluates to False because `current_index` (2) is not less than `len(self.playlist) - 1` (2).
8. Therefore, the `switch_song()` method returns `False` because it is already at the end of the playlist.

<<<Output>>>
False
