<<<Analysis>>>
1. Inside the `test()` method, a new `JobMarketplace` object is created.
2. The `submit_resume` method is called on the `jobMarketplace` object with the arguments "Tom", `['skill1', 'skill2']`, and "experience".
3. Inside the `submit_resume` method:
    - A new dictionary `resume` is created with the provided name, skills, and experience.
    - This `resume` dictionary is appended to the `self.resumes` list within the `jobMarketplace` object.
4. Finally, the `test()` method returns the `self.resumes` list from the `jobMarketplace` object. 

Therefore, the return value will be a list containing a single dictionary representing Tom's resume.

<<<Output>>>
[{'name': 'Tom', 'skills': ['skill1', 'skill2'], 'experience': 'experience'}]
