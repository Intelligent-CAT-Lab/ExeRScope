<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method, the ArrangementCalculator.factorial(4) method is invoked. The purpose of this method is to calculate the factorial of a given number n. In this case, n = 4.
Inside the factorial(), the variable result is initialized to 1.
A for loop iterates from 2 to n (which is 4 in this case), multiplying result by each integer in the range.
At the start: result = 1
The first iteration: i=2, result = 1 * 2 = 2
The second iteration: i=3, result = 2 * 3 = 6
The Third iteration: i=4, result = 6 * 4 = 24
After the loop completes, the method returns result, which is 24.
<<<Output>>>
24
