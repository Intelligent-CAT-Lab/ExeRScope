<<<Analysis>>>
1. Inside the `test()` method, a `CalendarUtil` object is created and assigned to the variable `calendar`.
2. The `add_event` method of the `calendar` object is called with a dictionary representing an event. This dictionary contains the date, start time, end time, and description of the event.
3. The `add_event` method appends this event dictionary to the `events` list attribute of the `calendar` object.
4. Finally, the `test()` method returns the `events` attribute of the `calendar` object. This attribute now contains the single event that was added.

<<<Output>>>
[{'date': datetime.datetime(2023, 1, 1, 0, 0), 'start_time': datetime.datetime(2023, 1, 1, 0, 0), 'end_time': datetime.datetime(2023, 1, 1, 23, 0), 'description': 'New Year'}]
