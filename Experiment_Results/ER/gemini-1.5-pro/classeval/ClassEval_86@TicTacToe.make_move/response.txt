<<<Analysis>>>
We first create an instance of the TicTacToe class.
Initially, the current player is 'X' and the board is empty.
1. ttt.make_move(0, 0): This makes a move at position (0, 0) with 'X'. The move is successful, the current player changes to 'O'.
2. ttt.make_move(0, 1): This makes a move at position (0, 1) with 'O'. The move is successful, the current player changes to 'X'.
3. ttt.make_move(0, 0): This attempts to make a move at position (0, 0) with 'X'. However, this position is already occupied. The move is unsuccessful, and the current player remains 'X'.
Finally, the test function returns the initial player ('X'), the result of each move (True, True, False), and the final current player ('X').
<<<Output>>>
('X', True, True, False, 'X')
