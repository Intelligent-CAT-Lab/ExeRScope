<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method:
1. An instance of the BankAccount class named account1 is created. Since no initial balance is provided, the default balance of 0 is used.
2. The view_balance() method is called on the account1 object. This method simply returns the current balance of the account.
Therefore, the test() method will return the initial balance of the account1 object.
<<<Output>>>
0
