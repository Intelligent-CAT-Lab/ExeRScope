<<<Analysis>>>
The test() method tests the functionality of the VendingMachine class. Let's break down the code execution step by step:

1. **Initialization:**
   - A `VendingMachine` object is created and assigned to the variable `vendingMachine`.

2. **Adding Items:**
   - `vendingMachine.add_item('Coke', 1.25, 10)`: This adds 'Coke' to the vending machine's inventory with a price of $1.25 and a quantity of 10. Since it's a new item, it's added directly to the `inventory` dictionary.
   - `vendingMachine.add_item('Pizza', 1.25, 10)`: Similarly, 'Pizza' is added to the inventory.
   - `vendingMachine.add_item('Pizza', 1.25, 10)`: This attempts to add 'Pizza' again. However, since 'Pizza' already exists, the `restock_item` method is called. This increases the quantity of 'Pizza' by 10.
   - `vendingMachine.add_item('Coke', 1.25, 10)`: This attempts to add 'Coke' again. Like with 'Pizza', the `restock_item` method is called, increasing the quantity of 'Coke' by 10.

3. **Returning the Inventory:**
   - Finally, `vendingMachine.inventory` is returned. This will be a dictionary containing the items 'Coke' and 'Pizza', along with their prices and quantities.

<<<Output>>>
{'Coke': {'price': 1.25, 'quantity': 20}, 'Pizza': {'price': 1.25, 'quantity': 20}}
