<<<Analysis>>>
The function `get_all_students_with_fail_course` iterates through all students in the `assessment_system`. For each student, it checks if any of their course scores are below 60. If a course score below 60 is found, the student's name is added to the `students` list, and the loop breaks for that student (meaning we only care if they have *at least* one failing grade).

Let's analyze each student:

* **Alice:** Both course scores (Mathematics: 90, Science: 80) are greater than or equal to 60. Alice is not added to the list.
* **Bob:** Physics score is 70, which is greater than or equal to 60. Bob is not added to the list.
* **Charlie:** Chemistry score is 70, which is greater than or equal to 60. Charlie is not added to the list.
* **David:** Physics score is 70, which is greater than or equal to 60. David is not added to the list.
* **Eve:** Both course scores (Mathematics: 90) are greater than or equal to 60. Eve is not added to the list.

Since no student has a course score below 60, the function will return an empty list.
