<<<Analysis>>>
1. Inside the `test()` method, an instance of the `AssessmentSystem` class is created and assigned to the variable `assessment_system`.
2. The `add_student()` method of the `assessment_system` object is called with the arguments `"Alice"`, `3`, and `"Mathematics"`.
3. Inside the `add_student()` method:
    - A new key `"Alice"` is added to the `self.students` dictionary.
    - The value associated with the key `"Alice"` is another dictionary containing the student's information: `{'name': "Alice", 'grade': 3, 'major': "Mathematics", 'courses': {}}`.
4. The `test()` method then returns the value associated with the key `'Alice'` in the `assessment_system.students` dictionary.
Therefore, the `test()` method will return a dictionary containing the information of the student "Alice".
<<<Output>>>
{'name': 'Alice', 'grade': 3, 'major': 'Mathematics', 'courses': {}}
