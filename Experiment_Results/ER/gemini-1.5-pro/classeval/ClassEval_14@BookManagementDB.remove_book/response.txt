<<<Analysis>>>
1. **Initialization**:
   - `self.db_name = "test.db"`: Sets up the database name.
   - `self.db = BookManagementDB(self.db_name)`: Creates an instance of `BookManagementDB`, which initializes a SQLite database connection and creates a table named "books" if it doesn't exist.
   - `self.connection = sqlite3.connect(self.db_name)`: Establishes a direct connection to the database.
   - `self.cursor = self.connection.cursor()`: Creates a cursor object to interact with the database.

2. **Adding a book**:
   - `self.db.add_book("Book to Remove", "John Doe")`: This line adds a new book entry into the "books" table. Since it's the first entry, it gets an `id` of 1 automatically.

3. **Removing the book**:
   - `self.db.remove_book(1)`: This line removes the book with `id` 1 from the "books" table.

4. **Checking for the removed book**:
   - `self.cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM books WHERE id=1")`: This line tries to fetch data from the "books" table where the `id` is 1.
   - `result = self.cursor.fetchone()`: Since the book with `id` 1 was deleted, `fetchone()` will return `None` indicating no data was found.

5. **Return Value**:
   - The `test()` method returns the `result`, which is `None`.
