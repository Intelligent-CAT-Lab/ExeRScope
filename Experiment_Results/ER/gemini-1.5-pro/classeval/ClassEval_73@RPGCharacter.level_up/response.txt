<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method:
1. An instance of the RPGCharacter class is created with the name "John", 100 HP, 20 attack power, and 10 defense. The level is initialized to 1 by default.
2. The level_up() method is called on the character object.
   - Inside level_up():
     - Since the character's level (1) is less than 100, the code proceeds.
     - The character's level is incremented by 1 (level becomes 2).
     - The character's experience points (exp) are set to 0.
     - The character's HP is increased by 20 (HP becomes 120).
     - The character's attack power is increased by 5 (attack power becomes 25).
     - The character's defense is increased by 5 (defense becomes 15).
     - The method returns a tuple containing the updated level, HP, attack power, and defense of the character: (2, 120, 25, 15).
3. The test() method returns the values returned by the level_up() method.
<<<Output>>>
(2, 0, 120, 25, 15)
