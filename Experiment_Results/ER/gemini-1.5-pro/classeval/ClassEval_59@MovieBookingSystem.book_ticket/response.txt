<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method:
1. An instance of `MovieBookingSystem` is created and assigned to `self.system`.
2. `add_movie` method is called on this instance with the parameters 'Batman', 49.9, '17:05', '19:25', and 3. This adds a movie 'Batman' to the system with the given price, start and end times, and a 3x3 seating arrangement.
3. `book_ticket` is called with the movie name 'Batman' and a list containing a single seat coordinate (0, 0). This successfully books the seat at (0, 0).
4. `book_ticket` is called again with the same parameters ('Batman', [(0, 0)]). This time, the function iterates through the seats to book and finds that the seat at (0, 0) is already booked (its value is 1). Therefore, it returns "Booking failed."
5. Finally, the test function returns a tuple containing the result of the second `book_ticket` call ("Booking failed.") and the value of the seat at (0, 0) which is 1.

<<<Output>>>
('Booking failed.', 1)
