<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method:
1. We create an instance of the Classroom class with id 1.
2. We define a course dictionary with details - name: 'Art', start_time: '14:00', and end_time: '15:00'.
3. We add this course to the classroom's courses list using the add_course method. Since the course is not already present, it gets added.
4. We then remove the same course from the classroom's courses list using the remove_course method. Since the course is present in the list, it gets removed.
5. Finally, we return the course dictionary and the classroom's courses list. As we removed the only course present in the list, the list would now be empty.

<<<Output>>>
({'name': 'Art', 'start_time': '14:00', 'end_time': '15:00'}, [])
