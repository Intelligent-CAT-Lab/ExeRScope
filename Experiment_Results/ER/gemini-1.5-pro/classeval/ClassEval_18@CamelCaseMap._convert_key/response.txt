<<<Analysis>>>
1. Inside the `test()` method, a new `CamelCaseMap` object is created and assigned to the variable `camelize_map`.
2. The `_convert_key()` method of the `camelize_map` object is called with the string "first_name" as the argument.
3. Inside the `_convert_key()` method:
    - It checks if the input key is a string. Since "first_name" is a string, it proceeds to convert it to camel case.
    - The `_to_camel_case()` method is called with "first_name" as the argument.
4. Inside the `_to_camel_case()` method:
    - The input string "first_name" is split into a list of words: ["first", "name"].
    - The first word "first" is taken as is.
    - The remaining words are iterated over, and the `title()` method is called on each word, capitalizing the first letter.
    - The capitalized words are then joined together with an empty string, resulting in "Name".
    - Finally, the first word "first" is concatenated with the capitalized "Name", resulting in "firstName".
    - The `_to_camel_case()` method returns "firstName".
5. The `_convert_key()` method returns the result of `_to_camel_case()`, which is "firstName".
6. The `test()` method returns the value returned by `_convert_key()`, which is "firstName".

<<<Output>>>
firstName
