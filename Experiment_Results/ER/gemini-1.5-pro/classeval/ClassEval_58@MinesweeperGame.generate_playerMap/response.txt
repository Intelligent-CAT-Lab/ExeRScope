<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method, a MinesweeperGame object is created with n = 1 and k = 4. However, since n represents the dimensions of the game board, a 1x1 board cannot accommodate 4 mines. 
The generate_playerMap() method is then called on this MinesweeperGame object. This method initializes a 2D array representing the player's view of the game board. The array is filled with '-' characters, indicating that no cells have been revealed yet.
Since n = 1, the generated player map will be a 1x1 array containing a single '-'.
<<<Output>>>
