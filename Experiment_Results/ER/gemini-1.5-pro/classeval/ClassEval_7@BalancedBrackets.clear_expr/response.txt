<<<Analysis>>>
1. Inside the `test()` method, an instance of the `BalancedBrackets` class is created with the expression "[a](b){c}".
2. The `clear_expr()` method is called on this instance. 
3. Inside `clear_expr()`, the expression is iterated over, and only characters that are present in either `self.left_brackets` or `self.right_brackets` are kept. 
4. In this case, the characters 'a', 'b', and 'c' would be removed, leaving only the brackets.
5. The modified expression, now "()[]{}", is assigned back to `self.expr`.
6. Finally, the `test()` method returns the value of `b.expr`, which is the cleaned expression.
