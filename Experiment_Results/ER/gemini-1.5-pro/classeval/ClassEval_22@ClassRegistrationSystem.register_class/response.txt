<<<Analysis>>>
1. Inside the `Test.test()` method, a new `ClassRegistrationSystem` object is created and assigned to `self.registration_system`.
2. The code then calls the `register_class` method of the `self.registration_system` object with `student_name='John'` and `class_name='CS101'`.
3. Inside the `register_class` method:
    - It checks if the student_name 'John' exists in the `students_registration_classes` dictionary. Since this is a new registration system and 'John' is not registered yet, the condition evaluates to False.
    - As the condition is False, the code goes to the else block and creates a new key 'John' in the `students_registration_classes` dictionary and assigns a list containing 'CS101' as its value.
    - Finally, it returns the value associated with the key 'John' in the `students_registration_classes` dictionary, which is `['CS101']`.
Therefore, the `Test.test()` method will return the list `['CS101']`.

<<<Output>>>
['CS101']
