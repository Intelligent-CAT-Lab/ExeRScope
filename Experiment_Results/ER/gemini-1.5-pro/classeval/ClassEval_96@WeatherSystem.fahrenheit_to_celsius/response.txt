<<<Analysis>>>
1. Inside the `test()` method, a `WeatherSystem` object is created with the city "New York".
2. The temperature attribute of the `weatherSystem` object is set to 73 (presumably Fahrenheit).
3. The `fahrenheit_to_celsius()` method of the `weatherSystem` object is called.
4. Inside `fahrenheit_to_celsius()`, the formula (self.temperature - 32) * 5/9 is used to convert the temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius.
5.  In this case, (73 - 32) * 5/9 = 22.78 (rounded to two decimal places).
6. The result of the conversion, 22.78, is returned by the `fahrenheit_to_celsius()` method and in turn by `Test.test()`.

<<<Output>>>
22.78
