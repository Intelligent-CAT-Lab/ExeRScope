Inside the test() method:
1. An RPGCharacter object named 'character' is created with the following initial stats:
    - name: "John"
    - hp: 100
    - attack_power: 20
    - defense: 10
    - level: 1 (default)
    - exp: 0 (default)

2. The character.gain_exp(400) method is called. Let's break down what happens inside this method:

    - Initially: amount = 400
    - Enter the while loop:
        - First iteration:
            - self.exp + amount (0 + 400) is greater than or equal to self.level * 100 (1 * 100).
            - Therefore, amount is reduced by (100 - 0) = 100, leaving amount = 300.
            - The level_up() method is called:
                - character's level is increased to 2.
                - character's exp is set to 0.
                - character's hp is increased to 120.
                - character's attack_power is increased to 25.
                - character's defense is increased to 15.
        - Second iteration:
            - self.exp + amount (0 + 300) is greater than or equal to self.level * 100 (2 * 100).
            - Therefore, amount is reduced by (200 - 0) = 200, leaving amount = 100.
            - The level_up() method is called:
                - character's level is increased to 3.
                - character's exp is set to 0.
                - character's hp is increased to 140.
                - character's attack_power is increased to 30.
                - character's defense is increased to 20.
        - Third iteration:
            - self.exp + amount (0 + 100) is equal to self.level * 100 (3 * 100).
            - Therefore, amount is reduced by (300 - 0) = 300, leaving amount = 0.
            - The level_up() method is called:
                - character's level is increased to 4.
                - character's exp is set to 0.
                - character's hp is increased to 160.
                - character's attack_power is increased to 35.
                - character's defense is increased to 25.
        - Since amount is now 0, the while loop exits.

3. Finally, the test() method returns the character's level and exp, which are now 4 and 0 respectively.

<<<Output>>>
(4, 0)
