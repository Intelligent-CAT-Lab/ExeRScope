Inside the test() method:
1. An instance of the 'NLPDataProcessor' class is created and assigned to the variable 'self.processor'.
2. A list of strings 'string_list' is defined.
3. An empty list 'stop_word_list' is defined.
4. The 'remove_stop_words()' method of the 'self.processor' object is called with 'string_list' and 'stop_word_list' as arguments. Let's analyze what happens inside this method:
    - An empty list 'answer' is initialized.
    - The code iterates through each string in 'string_list'.
    - For each string, it splits it into a list of words 'string_split'.
    - Then, it iterates through each 'word' in 'string_split'.
    - If the 'word' is found in the 'stop_word_list' (which is empty in this case), it is removed from 'string_split'. However, since 'stop_word_list' is empty, this condition will never be true.
    - After processing all the words in 'string_split', the modified 'string_split' is appended to the 'answer' list.
    - Finally, the 'remove_stop_words()' method returns the 'answer' list.
5. The returned 'answer' list from 'remove_stop_words()' is assigned to the variable 'words_list'.
6. The variable 'expected_words_list' is created with the expected output.
7. Finally, the 'test()' method returns 'words_list' and 'expected_words_list'.
