<<<Analysis>>>
1. Inside the `test()` method, an instance of the `AreaCalculator` class is created with `radius=2000`.
2. The `calculate_circle_area()` method is called on this instance.
3. Inside `calculate_circle_area()`, the formula for the area of a circle (`π * r^2`) is used, where `r` is the radius.
4. The value of `π` is obtained from the `math` module.
5. The calculation becomes `math.pi * 2000 ** 2`.
6. The result of this calculation is returned.
