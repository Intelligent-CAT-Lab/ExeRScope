Inside the test() method, a Calculator object is created and the calculate method is called with the expression '1+2*3'.

1. For the first character '1', it's a digit so it's appended to the num_buffer.
2. The next character '+' is an operator. The code checks for any numbers in the num_buffer, finds '1', converts it to a float and appends it to the operand_stack. The '+' is then pushed onto the operator_stack.
3. '2' is a digit, so it's appended to the now empty num_buffer.
4. '*' is an operator. Similar to step 2, '2' is added to the operand_stack. '*' has higher precedence than '+' on the operator_stack, so it's pushed onto the operator_stack as well.
5. '3' is appended to the num_buffer.
6. Reaching the end of the expression triggers the final steps. '3' is moved from the num_buffer to the operand_stack.
7. Now, the operator_stack is processed. '*' has higher precedence than '+', so it's applied first. 2 * 3 = 6, and 6 replaces 2 and 3 on the operand_stack.
8. Finally, '+' is applied to the remaining operands, 1 + 6 = 7.
9. The last remaining number on the operand_stack is 7, which is returned as the result.
