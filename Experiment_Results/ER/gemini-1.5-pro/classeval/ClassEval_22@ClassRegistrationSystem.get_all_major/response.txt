<<<Analysis>>>
The `Test.test()` method initializes a `ClassRegistrationSystem` object and populates its `students` list with five student dictionaries. It then calls the `get_all_major()` method of the `registration_system` object and returns the result.

Let's analyze the `get_all_major()` method step-by-step:

1. **Initialization:** An empty list called `major_list` is created to store the unique majors.
2. **Iterating through students:** The method iterates through each student dictionary in the `self.students` list.
3. **Checking for unique majors:** For each student, it checks if the student's major is already present in the `major_list`.
4. **Adding unique majors:** If the major is not present in `major_list`, it is appended to the list.
5. **Returning the list:** After iterating through all students, the `major_list` containing the unique majors is returned.

Therefore, the `get_all_major()` method will return a list containing the unique majors of the students in the `students` list, which are "Computer Science", "Mathematics", and "Physics".
<<<Output>>>
['Computer Science', 'Mathematics', 'Physics']
