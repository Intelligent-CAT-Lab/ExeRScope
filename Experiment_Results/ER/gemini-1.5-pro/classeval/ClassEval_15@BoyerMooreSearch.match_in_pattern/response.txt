<<<Analysis>>>
1. Inside the `Test.test()` method, a `BoyerMooreSearch` object is created with the text "ABAABA" and the pattern "ABAB".
2. The `match_in_pattern('B')` method is called on this object.
3. Inside `match_in_pattern()`:
    - The for loop iterates through the pattern "ABAB" in reverse order, from the last character 'B' to the first character 'A'.
    - In the first iteration, it compares 'B' with the current character 'B'. Since they match, the method returns the index `1`, which is the index of the current character in the pattern.
