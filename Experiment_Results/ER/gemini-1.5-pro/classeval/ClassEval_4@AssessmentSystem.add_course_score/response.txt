<<<Analysis>>>
1. **Initialization:** An instance of the `AssessmentSystem` class is created and assigned to the variable `assessment_system`.
2. **Setting Students:** The `students` attribute of the `assessment_system` object is directly assigned a dictionary containing information for student "Alice". 
3. **Adding Course Score:** The `add_course_score` method is called with the student's name "Alice", the course name "Math", and the score 90. 
    - Inside the method, it checks if the student "Alice" exists in the `students` dictionary (which is true).
    - Then, it accesses the 'courses' dictionary within the "Alice" entry and adds a new key-value pair: "Math": 90. This effectively records that Alice scored 90 in "Math".
4. **Accessing and Returning the Score:** The code then accesses and returns the score for "Math" for student "Alice" from the `students` dictionary. This is done by navigating through the nested dictionaries: `assessment_system.students['Alice']['courses']['Math']`.

<<<Output>>>
90
