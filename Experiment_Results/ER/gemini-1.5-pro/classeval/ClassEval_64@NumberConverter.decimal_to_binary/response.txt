<<<Analysis>>>
The test() method calls the decimal_to_binary() method of the NumberConverter class with the argument 169815.

Inside the decimal_to_binary() method:
1. The built-in function bin() is used to convert the decimal number (169815) into its binary representation. The bin() function returns a string with the prefix "0b" indicating it's a binary representation.
2. The slicing [2:] is used to remove the "0b" prefix from the binary string.
3. The remaining string, which is the binary representation of the input decimal number, is returned.
