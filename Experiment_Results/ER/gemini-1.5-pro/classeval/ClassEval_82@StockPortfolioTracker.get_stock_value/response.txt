<<<Analysis>>>
1. Inside the `test()` method, a `StockPortfolioTracker` object is created with an initial cash balance of 10000.0.
2. The `get_stock_value()` method of the `tracker` object is called with a dictionary representing a stock holding as an argument. This dictionary contains the stock's name ('AAPL'), price (0.0), and quantity (10).
3. The `get_stock_value()` method calculates the value of the stock holding by multiplying the stock's price by its quantity. In this case: 0.0 * 10 = 0.0.
4. The `get_stock_value()` method returns the calculated value, which is 0.0.
5. Therefore, the `test()` method returns 0.0.
