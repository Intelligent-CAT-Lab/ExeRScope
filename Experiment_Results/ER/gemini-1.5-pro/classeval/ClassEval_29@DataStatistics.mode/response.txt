<<<Analysis>>>
1. Inside the `test()` method, a `DataStatistics` object `ds` is created.
2. The `mode()` method of the `ds` object is called with the list `[2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]` as input.
3. Inside the `mode()` method:
    - A `Counter` object is created from the input data, which will store the frequency of each element.
    - `counter.values()` returns all the values (frequencies) from the `Counter` object. 
    - `max()` function finds the highest frequency in the `Counter` object.
    - A list comprehension is used to create a list `mode` containing all elements that appear with the highest frequency (i.e., the mode).
4. The `mode()` method returns the `mode` list.
5. The `test()` method returns the result received from the `mode()` method.
