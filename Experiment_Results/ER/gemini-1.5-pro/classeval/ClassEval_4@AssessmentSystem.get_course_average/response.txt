<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method, an instance of the AssessmentSystem class is created and initialized with data for three students (Alice, Bob, and Charlie) including their grades in different courses. 

The method `get_course_average('Physics')` is called to calculate the average score for the 'Physics' course. 

Here's how the code calculates the average:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `total` is set to 0, which will store the sum of all 'Physics' scores.
   - `count` is set to 0, which will store the number of students who have a 'Physics' score.

2. **Iterating through students:**
   - The code iterates through each student in the `assessment_system.students` dictionary.

3. **Checking for 'Physics' score:**
   - For each student, it checks if the student has a score for 'Physics' (`if course in student['courses']`).

4. **Adding to total and incrementing count:**
   - If the student has a 'Physics' score, the score is added to `total`, and `count` is incremented by 1.
   - Note that Charlie's score in Physics is None, so it won't be added to the total, and count won't be incremented for Charlie.

5. **Calculating and returning the average:**
   - After processing all students, the average is calculated by dividing `total` by `count` only if `count` is greater than 0 (meaning at least one student has a 'Physics' score).

Based on the given data:
- Alice doesn't have a 'Physics' score.
- Bob has a 'Physics' score of 85.
- Charlie has a 'Physics' score of None.

Therefore, `total` will be 85, and `count` will be 1. The average will be 85 / 1 = 85.0.

<<<Output>>>
85.0
