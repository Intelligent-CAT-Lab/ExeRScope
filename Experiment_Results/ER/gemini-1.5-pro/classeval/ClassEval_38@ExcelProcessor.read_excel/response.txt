Inside the test() method:
1. `self.test_file_name` is initialized as an empty string.
2. An instance of the `ExcelProcessor` class is created as `processor`.
3. The `read_excel` method of the `processor` object is called with `self.test_file_name` (which is an empty string) as the argument.
4. Inside the `read_excel` method:
    - An empty list called `data` is initialized.
    - The code enters a try-except block.
    - Since the `file_name` is an empty string, `openpyxl.load_workbook(file_name)` will raise an exception.
    - The exception is caught in the `except` block, and `None` is returned.
5. Therefore, the `read_excel` method returns `None`.
6. Consequently, the `test()` method also returns `None`.

<<<Output>>>
