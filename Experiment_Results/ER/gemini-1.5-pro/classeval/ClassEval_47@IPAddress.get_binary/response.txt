<<<Analysis>>>
1. Inside the `test()` method, an `IPAddress` object is created with the IP address ".10.10.10".
2. The `get_binary()` method is called on this `IPAddress` object.
3. In `get_binary()`, it first checks if the IP address is valid using `self.is_valid()`.
4. `is_valid()` splits the IP address by '.' and checks if there are four octets. It then validates whether each octet is a digit and within the range of 0-255. In this case, the IP address is invalid because the first octet is empty.
5. Since `is_valid()` returns `False`, `get_binary()` returns an empty string ''.
