<<<Analysis>>>
The code calculates the skewness of a dataset. Here's a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Input:** The input is a list of numbers: [1, 1, 1].

2. **Calculate mean:** 
   - The mean of the data is (1 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 1.

3. **Calculate variance:**
   - For each data point, calculate the squared difference from the mean: (1-1)^2 = 0, (1-1)^2 = 0, (1-1)^2 = 0.
   - Sum the squared differences: 0 + 0 + 0 = 0.
   - Divide the sum by the number of data points to get the variance: 0 / 3 = 0.

4. **Calculate standard deviation:**
   - Take the square root of the variance: sqrt(0) = 0.

5. **Calculate skewness:**
   - **Since the standard deviation is 0, the code will return 0 directly to avoid division by zero.**
