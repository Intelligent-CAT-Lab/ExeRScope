<<<Analysis>>>
1. Inside the `Test.test()` method, a `SQLGenerator` object is created with the table name 'table1'.
2. The `select_by_age_range()` method of the `sql` object is called with arguments `50` and `60`.
3. Inside the `select_by_age_range()` method:
    - A condition string is constructed as `"age BETWEEN 50 AND 60"`.
    - The `select()` method of the same object is called with this `condition`.
4. Inside the `select()` method:
    - Since the `fields` argument is not provided, it defaults to `"*"`.
    - The SQL query string is constructed using f-string formatting:
        - `"SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE age BETWEEN 50 AND 60;"`
    - This query string is returned.
5. The `test()` method returns the result from `select_by_age_range()`, which is the constructed SQL query string.

<<<Output>>>
SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE age BETWEEN 50 AND 60;
