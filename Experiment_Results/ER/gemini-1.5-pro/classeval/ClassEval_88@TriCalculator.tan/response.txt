<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method, a TriCalculator object is instantiated and its tan() method is called with an argument of 60.

Inside the tan() method:
- It first checks if the cosine of 60 degrees is not zero. 
- It calls the cos() method to calculate the cosine of 60 degrees.
- Inside the cos() method:
    - It converts the angle from degrees to radians.
    - It calls the taylor() method to calculate the cosine value using the Taylor series expansion.
    - The taylor() method approximates the cosine value using a series expansion.
    - The calculated cosine value is returned.
- If the cosine value is not zero, the tan() method proceeds to calculate the tangent by dividing the sine of 60 degrees by the cosine of 60 degrees.
- It calls the sin() method to calculate the sine of 60 degrees.
- Inside the sin() method:
    - It converts the angle from degrees to radians.
    - It calculates the sine value using a series expansion.
    - The calculated sine value is returned.
- The tangent value is then calculated by dividing the sine value by the cosine value.
- The calculated tangent value is rounded to 10 decimal places and returned.
