1. **Initialization:**
   - An instance of `AvgPartition` is created with `lst = [1, 2, 3, 4]` and `limit = 2`.
   - `self.lst` is set to `[1, 2, 3, 4]` and `self.limit` is set to `2`.

2. **`test()` Method Execution:**
   - Inside the `test()` method, `a.get(1)` is called, where `a` is the instance of `AvgPartition`.

3. **`get()` Method Execution:**
   - `size, remainder = self.setNum()` is called:
     - `size` is calculated as `len(self.lst) // self.limit`, which is `4 // 2 = 2`.
     - `remainder` is calculated as `len(self.lst) % self.limit`, which is `4 % 2 = 0`.
     - `size = 2` and `remainder = 0` are returned.
   - `start` is calculated as `index * size + min(index, remainder)`, which is `1 * 2 + min(1, 0) = 2`.
   - `end` is initially set to `start + size`, which is `2 + 2 = 4`.
   - The condition `index + 1 <= remainder` evaluates to `1 + 1 <= 0`, which is false, so `end` remains `4`.
   - Finally, `self.lst[start:end]` is returned, which is `[1, 2, 3, 4][2:4]`, resulting in `[3, 4]`.
