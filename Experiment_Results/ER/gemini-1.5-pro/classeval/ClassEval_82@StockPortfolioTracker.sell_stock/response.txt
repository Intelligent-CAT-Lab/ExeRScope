<<<Analysis>>>
1. **Initialization:**
   - A `StockPortfolioTracker` object is created with an initial cash balance of 10000.0.
   - The `portfolio` attribute is initialized with a list containing one stock: {'name': 'AAPL', 'price': 150.0, 'quantity': 20}.

2. **Selling Stock:**
   - The `sell_stock` method is called with the arguments {'name': 'AAPL', 'price': 150.0, 'quantity': 20}.
   - Inside `sell_stock`:
     - `remove_stock` is called with the same stock details.
     - `remove_stock` locates the 'AAPL' stock in the portfolio.
     - Since the quantity to remove matches the existing quantity, the stock is removed from the portfolio.
     - `remove_stock` returns `True`.
   - Back in `sell_stock`:
     - The cash balance is increased by the value of the sold stock: 150.0 * 20 = 3000.0.
     - `sell_stock` returns `True`.

3. **Return Values:**
   - The `test` method returns a tuple containing:
     - The return value of `sell_stock`, which is `True`.
     - The updated `portfolio` attribute, which is now an empty list (`[]`) because the 'AAPL' stock was completely sold.
     - The updated `cash_balance`, which is 13000.0 (10000.0 + 3000.0).

<<<Output>>>
(True, [], 13000.0)
