1. Inside the `test()` method, an instance of `ImageProcessor` is created and assigned to `self.processor`.
2. `self.image_path` is set to the path of the "test.png" image within the current script's directory.
3. A new RGB image with a size of 100x100 pixels and filled with white color (255, 255, 255) is created.
4. This newly created image is saved to the path specified by `self.image_path`, which is "test.png".
5. The `load_image()` method of the `self.processor` object is called, passing the `self.image_path`. This method opens the "test.png" image and stores it within the `self.processor.image` attribute.
6. Finally, `self.processor.image.format` is returned. This retrieves and returns the format of the loaded image, which in this case is determined by how the image was saved in the previous step. Since the image was saved using `image.save(self.image_path)` without explicitly specifying the format, PIL automatically determines the format based on the file extension, which is ".png".

Therefore, the `test()` method returns the image format of the loaded "test.png" image.
