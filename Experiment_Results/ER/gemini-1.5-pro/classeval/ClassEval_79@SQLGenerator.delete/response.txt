<<<Analysis>>>
1. The `test()` method creates an instance of the `SQLGenerator` class, called `sql`, with the table name "table1".
2. It then calls the `delete()` method on the `sql` object, passing in the string "field1 = value1 AND field2 = value2 AND field3 = value3 AND field4 = value4" as the condition.
3. The `delete()` method takes this condition and constructs a SQL DELETE statement by inserting the table name and the condition into a formatted string.
4. Finally, the `delete()` method returns the constructed SQL statement, which is "DELETE FROM table1 WHERE field1 = value1 AND field2 = value2 AND field3 = value3 AND field4 = value4;".
<<<Output>>>
DELETE FROM table1 WHERE field1 = value1 AND field2 = value2 AND field3 = value3 AND field4 = value4;
