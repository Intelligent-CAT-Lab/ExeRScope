Inside the test() method:
1. It creates an instance of ArrangementCalculator with the input data [1], let's call it 'ac'.
2. It calls the 'select_all' method on this instance 'ac'.
3. Inside the 'select_all' method:
    - It initializes an empty list called 'result'.
    - It iterates through a range from 1 to the length of 'self.datas' (which is 1 in this case) + 1, so i = 1.
    - For each 'i', it calls the 'select' method with 'i' as an argument and extends the 'result' list with the returned value.
4. Inside the 'select' method:
    - Since 'm' is not provided, it defaults to the length of 'self.datas', which is 1.
    - It initializes an empty list called 'result'.
    - It iterates through all permutations of 'self.datas' ([1] in this case) taken 'm' (1) at a time.
    - For each permutation, it appends the permutation as a list to the 'result' list.
    - In this case, there's only one permutation: [1].
    - The 'select' method returns [[1]].
5. The 'select_all' method extends the 'result' list with [[1]] and returns it.
6. Finally, the 'test' method returns a tuple containing the result ([[1]]) and the expected value ([[1]]).
