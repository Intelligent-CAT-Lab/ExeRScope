<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method:
1. Two EmailClient objects are created: 'sender' with a capacity of 100, and 'receiver' with a capacity of 50.
2. The receiver's inbox is initialized with three emails with sizes 10, 20, and 15, respectively.
3. The `receiver.clear_inbox(50)` method is called. Let's analyze what happens inside this method:
    - The `clear_inbox()` method intends to clear space in the inbox until at least 'size' (which is 50 in this case) is freed.
    - It first checks if the inbox is empty. If so, it returns.
    - It initializes `freed_space` to 0.
    - It enters a `while` loop that continues as long as `freed_space` is less than 'size' and the inbox is not empty.
    - In each iteration:
        - It retrieves the first email in the inbox.
        - It adds the size of this email to `freed_space`.
        - It deletes the email from the inbox.
    - The loop continues until `freed_space` is greater than or equal to 'size' or the inbox becomes empty.
    - In this specific case, the loop will iterate twice:
        - First iteration: `freed_space` will become 10, and the first email (size 10) will be removed.
        - Second iteration: `freed_space` will become 30 (10 + 20), and the second email (size 20) will be removed.
    - Now, `freed_space` is 30, which is still less than 'size' (50). However, the loop will terminate because there are no more emails in the inbox.
- Finally, the `clear_inbox()` method implicitly returns `None` because it reaches the end of the function without hitting a return statement.

Therefore, the `receiver.clear_inbox(50)` call will return `None`.
