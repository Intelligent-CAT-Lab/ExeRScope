<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method, a GomokuGame object is created with a board size of 10. Since the board is empty at initialization, the check_winner() method will return None as there is no winner yet. Let's analyze why.

The check_winner() method iterates through every cell of the board. For each cell, it checks if the cell is empty. If not, it further checks if there are five consecutive same symbols in all four directions (horizontal, vertical, two diagonals).

However, since the board is initially empty, the condition `if self.board[row][col] != ' ': ` is never met, so the code inside this condition, which checks for five in a row, is never executed.

Therefore, the check_winner() method doesn't find any five consecutive symbols in a row and returns None.
<<<Output>>>
None
