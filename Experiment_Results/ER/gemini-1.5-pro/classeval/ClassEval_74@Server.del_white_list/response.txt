<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method, a Server object is created. When the Server object is initialized via  ```__init__```, it initializes the 'white_list' to an empty list.
Next, ```server.del_white_list(22)``` is called. This method attempts to remove the value 22 from the 'white_list'.
Since the 'white_list' is currently empty, the condition 'addr not in self.white_list' evaluates to True.
Therefore, the method returns False, indicating that the deletion was not successful because the element was not present in the list.
<<<Output>>>
False
