<<<Analysis>>>
1. **Initialization:** A `JobMarketplace` object is created and its `job_listings` attribute is set to a list containing two job dictionaries.
2. **Calling `search_jobs`:** The `search_jobs` method is called with the argument `criteria='skill6'`.
3. **Iterating through job listings:** The method iterates through each job dictionary in the `job_listings` list.
    - For each job, it checks if the `criteria` ('skill6') is present in the job title or in the requirements list.
    - Since 'skill6' is not present in any of the job titles or requirements lists, the condition in the `if` statement evaluates to `False`.
4. **Returning an empty list:** As no matching jobs are found, the `matching_jobs` list remains empty, and the method returns this empty list.
