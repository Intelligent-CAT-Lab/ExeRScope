<<<Analysis>>>
1. Inside the `test()` method, a `BitStatusUtil` object is instantiated. However, this is unnecessary as the `has` method is a static method and doesn't require an object instance.
2. `bit_status_util.has(6, 4)` is called, which invokes the static `has` method of the `BitStatusUtil` class with arguments `states = 6` and `stat = 4`.
3. Inside the `has` method:
    - `BitStatusUtil.check([states, stat])` is called to validate the input arguments. Both 6 and 4 are non-negative and even numbers, so the check passes.
    - The expression `(states & stat) == stat` is evaluated. 
        - `(6 & 4)` performs a bitwise AND operation between 6 (binary 110) and 4 (binary 100), resulting in 4 (binary 100).
        - Since `4 == 4` is True, the `has` method returns `True`.
