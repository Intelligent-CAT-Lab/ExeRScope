<<<Analysis>>>
1. **Initialization:**
   - A `CalendarUtil` object is created and assigned to the variable `calendar`.
   - The `calendar.events` list is initialized with a single event dictionary representing the New Year event.

2. **Calling `is_available()`:**
   - The `calendar.is_available()` method is called with `start_time` and `end_time` both set to the beginning of New Year's Day, 2023.

3. **Iterating through Events:**
   - The `is_available()` method iterates through each event in `calendar.events`. Since there's only one event (New Year), it examines that event.

4. **Checking Time Overlap:**
   - The code compares the provided `start_time` and `end_time` with the event's `start_time` and `end_time`:
     - `start_time` (2023-01-01 00:00:00) is less than the event's `end_time` (2023-01-01 01:00:00) - **True**
     - `end_time` (2023-01-01 01:00:00) is greater than the event's `start_time` (2023-01-01 00:00:00) - **True**
   - Since both conditions in the `if` statement are True, the method returns `False`, indicating that the time slot is not available.
