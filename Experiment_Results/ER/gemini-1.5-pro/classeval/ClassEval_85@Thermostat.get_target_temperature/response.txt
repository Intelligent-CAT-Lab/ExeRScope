<<<Analysis>>>
1. Inside the `test()` method, a `Thermostat` object `t` is created with the parameters `current_temperature=25`, `target_temperature=25`, and `mode='cool'`.
2. The `get_target_temperature()` method is called on the `t` object.
3. The `get_target_temperature()` method simply returns the value of the `target_temperature` attribute of the object.
4. Since the object `t` was initialized with `target_temperature=25`, the `get_target_temperature()` method will return `25`.

<<<Output>>>
25
