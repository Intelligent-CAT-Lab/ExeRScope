<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method, the HtmlUtil._HtmlUtil__format_line_feed('aaa\n\n\n\n') method is invoked. This method aims to format line feeds within a given text, replacing multiple consecutive newline characters with a single newline. Let's break down how it processes the input 'aaa\n\n\n\n':

1. The function uses the re.sub() method to substitute all occurrences of the regular expression r'\n+' with a single newline character '\n'.
2. The regular expression r'\n+' matches one or more occurrences of the newline character. Therefore, any sequence of two or more newline characters will be replaced with a single newline.
3. Applying this to the input 'aaa\n\n\n\n', all the consecutive newline characters after "aaa" are replaced with a single newline.

Therefore, the method returns 'aaa\n'.
<<<Output>>>
aaa\n
