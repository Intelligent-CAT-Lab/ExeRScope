<<<Analysis>>>
The `test()` method first creates an instance of the `ExcelProcessor` class. Then, it defines a list of tuples called `new_data` which represents the data to be written to the excel file. An empty string is assigned to `save_file_name`, which will cause an error later as it's not a valid file name.  The code then calls `processor.write_excel(new_data, save_file_name)` to write the data to the excel file. Inside the `write_excel` method, it tries to create a workbook. However, since the `save_file_name` is an empty string, it will raise an error when trying to save the workbook. This error is caught by the `except` block, which returns 0 indicating that the writing operation was not successful.
