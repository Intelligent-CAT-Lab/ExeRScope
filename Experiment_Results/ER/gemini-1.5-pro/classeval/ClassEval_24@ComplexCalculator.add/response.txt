<<<Analysis>>>
1. Inside the `Test.test()` method, a new `ComplexCalculator` object is created. However, this step is not relevant to the final output since the `add` method is static and doesn't depend on the instance of the class.
2. The line `complexCalculator.add((1 + 2j), (3 + 4j))` calls the static `add` method of the `ComplexCalculator` class.
3. Inside the `add` method:
    - `c1` is assigned the value (1 + 2j).
    - `c2` is assigned the value (3 + 4j).
    - The `real` part is calculated as `c1.real + c2.real`, which is `1 + 3 = 4`.
    - The `imaginary` part is calculated as `c1.imag + c2.imag`, which is `2 + 4 = 6`.
    - Finally, the `complex` function combines the calculated real and imaginary parts, resulting in `(4 + 6j)`.
4. The `add` method returns the complex number `(4 + 6j)`.
5. Therefore, the `test()` method returns `(4 + 6j)`.

<<<Output>>>
(4+6j)
