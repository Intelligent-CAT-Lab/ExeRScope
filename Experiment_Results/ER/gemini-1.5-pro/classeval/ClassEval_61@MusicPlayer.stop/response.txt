<<<Analysis>>>
1. Inside the `test()` method, a `MusicPlayer` object is created.
2. Two songs, "song1" and "song2", are added to the `playlist` of the `musicPlayer` object.
3. The `current_song` of the `musicPlayer` is set to "song2".
4. The `stop()` method of the `musicPlayer` object is called. 
5. Inside the `stop` method, since `self.current_song` is not None ("song2"), it sets `self.current_song` to `None` and returns `True`.

<<<Output>>>
True
