Let's break down the code execution step by step:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `self.file` is initialized as an empty string.
   - `file_path` is assigned the value of `self.file`, which is an empty string.
   - A `CSVProcessor` object is created.

2. **Calling `write_csv`:**
   - The `write_csv` method of the `csvProcessor` object is called with two arguments:
     - `data`: An empty list (`[]`).
     - `file_name`: The value of `file_path`, which is an empty string.

3. **Inside `write_csv`:**
   - The method attempts to open a file with the name specified by `file_name` (which is an empty string) in write mode (`'w'`).
   - **Exception:** Opening a file with an empty string as the file name will raise an exception (most likely `FileNotFoundError`).

4. **Handling the Exception:**
   - The `try...except` block in `write_csv` catches the exception.
   - Since the exception is caught, the code inside the `except` block is executed.
   - The `except` block simply returns `0`.

Therefore, due to the exception raised while trying to open a file with an empty file name, the `write_csv` method will return `0`.
