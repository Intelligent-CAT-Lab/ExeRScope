1. Inside the `test()` method, a `NumberWordFormatter` object is created and assigned to the variable `formatter`.
2. The `trans_two('80')` method is called on the `formatter` object. Let's break down what happens inside the `trans_two` method:
    - The input string `s` is '80'.
    - `s` is padded with '0' at the beginning to ensure a length of 2 using `s.zfill(2)`, resulting in '80'.
    - The conditional checks:
        - Since `s[0]` is '8' (not '0' or '1'), the last `elif` block is executed.
        - `self.NUMBER_TEN[int(s[0]) - 1]` evaluates to `self.NUMBER_TEN[7]` which is "EIGHTY".
        - `self.NUMBER[int(s[-1])]` evaluates to `self.NUMBER[0]` which is an empty string "".
        - The two parts are concatenated with a space in between: "EIGHTY" + " " + "" resulting in "EIGHTY ".
    - The method returns "EIGHTY ".
3. The `test()` method returns the result from `trans_two('80')`.
