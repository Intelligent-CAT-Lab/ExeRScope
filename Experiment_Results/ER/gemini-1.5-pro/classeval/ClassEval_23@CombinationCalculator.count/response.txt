Inside the test() method, the CombinationCalculator.count(5, 3) method is invoked. The purpose of this method is to calculate the combination  which is the number of ways to choose a sample of *m* elements from a set of *n* distinct objects where order does not matter. In this case, n = 5 and m = 3.

Inside the count(), It will calculate 5!/(3! * 2!) = 10
