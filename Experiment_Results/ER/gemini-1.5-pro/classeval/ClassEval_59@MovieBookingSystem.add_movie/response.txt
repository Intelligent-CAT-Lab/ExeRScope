<<<Analysis>>>
Let's break down the code execution step by step:

1. **Initialization:**
   - A `MovieBookingSystem` object is created and assigned to `self.system`.

2. **Adding a Movie:**
   - `self.system.add_movie('Batman', 29.9, '17:05', '19:25', 3)` is called:
     - Inside `add_movie`:
       - A dictionary representing the movie 'Batman' is created with its details (name, price, start and end times as datetime objects, and a 3x3 NumPy array initialized with zeros for seats).
       - This movie dictionary is appended to the `self.system.movies` list.

3. **Accessing Movie Details:**
   - The `return` statement returns a tuple containing various details of the added movie:
     - `len(self.system.movies)`: This will be 1, as we've added one movie.
     - `self.system.movies[0]['name']`: This accesses the 'name' element of the first movie in the list, which is 'Batman'.
     - `self.system.movies[0]['price']`: This accesses the 'price' element, which is 29.9.
     - `self.system.movies[0]['start_time']`: This accesses the 'start_time' element, which is a datetime object representing 17:05.
     - `datetime.strptime('17:05', '%H:%M')`: This creates another datetime object representing 17:05 for comparison.
     - `self.system.movies[0]['end_time']`: This accesses the 'end_time' element, a datetime object representing 19:25.
     - `datetime.strptime('19:25', '%H:%M')`: Similar to start_time, this creates a datetime object for 19:25.
     - `self.system.movies[0]['seats'].shape`: This accesses the 'seats' element (which is a NumPy array) and retrieves its shape, which is (3, 3).

<<<Output>>>
(1, 'Batman', 29.9, datetime.datetime(1900, 1, 1, 17, 5), datetime.datetime(1900, 1, 1, 17, 5), datetime.datetime(1900, 1, 1, 19, 25), datetime.datetime(1900, 1, 1, 19, 25), (3, 3))
