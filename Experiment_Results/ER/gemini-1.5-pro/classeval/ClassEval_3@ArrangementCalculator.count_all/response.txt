<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method, ArrangementCalculator.count_all(2) is called with n = 2.

Let's break down what happens inside count_all(2):

1. **Initialization:** `total` is initialized to 0.

2. **Looping:** The code iterates through the range from 1 to n+1 (which is 3 in this case).
   - **Iteration 1 (i = 1):** 
     - `ArrangementCalculator.count(2, 1)` is called. 
     - Inside `count(2, 1)`, it calculates 2! / (2-1)! = 2 / 1 = 2
     - This value (2) is added to `total`, making `total = 2`.
   - **Iteration 2 (i = 2):**
     - `ArrangementCalculator.count(2, 2)` is called.
     - Inside `count(2, 2)`, it calculates 2! / (2-2)! = 2 / 1 = 2
     - This value (2) is added to `total`, making `total = 4`.

3. **Return:** After the loop completes, the function `count_all` returns the `total`, which is 4.

Therefore, `ArrangementCalculator.count_all(2)` returns 4.
