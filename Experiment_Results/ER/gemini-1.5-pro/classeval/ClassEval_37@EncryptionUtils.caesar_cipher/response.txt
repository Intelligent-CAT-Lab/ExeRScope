Inside the test() method:
1. An instance of the `EncryptionUtils` class is created with the key "key".
2. The `caesar_cipher()` method of the `encryption_utils` object is called with the plaintext "abcxyz" and a shift of 27.
3. Inside the `caesar_cipher()` method:
    - It iterates through each character in the plaintext "abcxyz".
    - For each character:
        - It checks if the character is alphabetic.
        - If it is alphabetic:
            - It calculates the appropriate ASCII offset based on whether the character is uppercase or lowercase.
            - It then shifts the character by `shift` (27 in this case) positions, wrapping around from 'z' to 'a' using the modulo operator (%).
            - The shifted character is then appended to the `ciphertext`.
        - If it is not alphabetic, it is appended directly to the `ciphertext` without any modification.
    - After processing all characters, the `ciphertext` is returned.
4. In this specific case, a shift of 27 is equivalent to a shift of 1 (27 % 26 = 1). Therefore, each character in "abcxyz" will be shifted one position forward in the alphabet, resulting in "bcdyza".
