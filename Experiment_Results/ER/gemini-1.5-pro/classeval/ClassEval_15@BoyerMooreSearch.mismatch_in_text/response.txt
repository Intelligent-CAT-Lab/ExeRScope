<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method, a BoyerMooreSearch object is created with the text "ABAABA" and the pattern "ABC".
We then call the mismatch_in_text(3) method on this object. Let's break down what happens inside this method:

1. The mismatch_in_text(3) method is called with currentPos = 3. This means we are looking for a mismatch between the pattern "ABC" and the substring of "ABAABA" starting at index 3, which is "ABA".

2. The for loop iterates through the pattern "ABC" in reverse order, comparing each character with the corresponding character in the substring "ABA" of the text.

    * In the first iteration, i = 2:
        * It compares pattern[2] ('C') with text[3 + 2] ('A'). Since they don't match, it returns currentPos + i = 3 + 2 = 5.

3. Therefore, the mismatch_in_text(3) method returns 5.

<<<Output>>>
5
