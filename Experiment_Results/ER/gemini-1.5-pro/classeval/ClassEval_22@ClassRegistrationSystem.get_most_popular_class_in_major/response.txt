<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method:
1.  It initializes a ClassRegistrationSystem object and populates it with a list of students and their registered classes.
2.  It then calls the get_most_popular_class_in_major() method twice, once for "Computer Science" and once for "Mathematics".
3.  For "Computer Science", the method iterates through the students and their registered classes, creating a list of all classes taken by Computer Science students: ["Algorithms", "Data Structures", "Data Structures", "Algorithms", "Operating Systems", "Data Structures", "Operating Systems", "Calculus"].
4.  It finds the most frequent element in this list, which is "Data Structures".
5.  It repeats steps 3 and 4 for "Mathematics", finding that "Linear Algebra" is the most popular class for Mathematics students.
6.  Finally, the method returns a tuple containing the most popular classes for each major: ("Data Structures", "Linear Algebra").
<<<Output>>>
('Data Structures', 'Linear Algebra')
