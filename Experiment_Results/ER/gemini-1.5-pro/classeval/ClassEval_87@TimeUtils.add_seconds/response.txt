<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method:
1. We create an instance of the TimeUtils class.
2. We call the add_seconds() method on this instance with an argument of 300 seconds.
  - Inside the add_seconds() method:
    - It takes the current datetime stored in the instance and adds 300 seconds to it.
    - It then formats this new datetime object into a string representation of hours, minutes, and seconds ("%H:%M:%S").
    - This formatted string is returned by the add_seconds() method.
3. We obtain the current datetime stored in the TimeUtils instance and add 300 seconds to it using datetime.timedelta(seconds=300).
4. We format the resulting datetime object into a string representation of hours, minutes, and seconds ("%H:%M:%S").
5. The test() method returns a tuple. The first element of the tuple is the result from step 2, and the second element is the result from step 4.

Since the exact current time is not fixed, the output will show the time difference of 5 minutes.

<<<Output>>>
('HH:MM:SS', 'HH:MM:SS')  # The time in the second element of the tuple will be 5 minutes ahead of the first element.
