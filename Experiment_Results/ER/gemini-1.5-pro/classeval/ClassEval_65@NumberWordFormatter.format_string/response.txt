Inside the test() method, a NumberWordFormatter object is created and assigned to the variable 'formatter'.
Then, the format_string() method of the 'formatter' object is called with the string '123456' as input. Let's break down what happens inside the format_string() method:

1. Initialization:
   - lstr, rstr are initialized: Since the input '123456' has no '.', lstr will be '123456' and rstr will be an empty string.
   - lstrrev is set as the reverse of lstr: '654321'
   - a is initialized as a list of 5 empty strings: ['', '', '', '', '']

2. Padding lstrrev:
   - The code checks if the length of lstrrev is divisible by 3. If not, it pads it with '0's to make the length a multiple of 3. In this case, the length of '654321' is already a multiple of 3, so no padding is done.

3. Processing in groups of three:
   - The code iterates through lstrrev in groups of three digits.
     - For the first group, '654':
       - a[0] is set to the reverse of '654', which is '456'.
       - The trans_three('456') function is called, which returns 'FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY SIX'.
       - Since this is the first group, parse_more(0) returns an empty string.
       - lm is updated to 'FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY SIX  ' (note the two spaces at the end).
     - For the second group, '321':
       - a[1] is set to the reverse of '321', which is '123'.
       - The trans_three('123') function is called, which returns 'ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY THREE'.
       - parse_more(1) returns 'THOUSAND'.
       - lm is updated to 'ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY THREE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY SIX  '.

4. Handling cents:
   - Since rstr is empty, xs is set to an empty string.

5. Final output:
   - lm is not empty, so the code returns: 'ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY THREE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY SIX   ONLY' after stripping the extra spaces from lm.

<<<Output>>>
ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY THREE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY SIX ONLY
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
