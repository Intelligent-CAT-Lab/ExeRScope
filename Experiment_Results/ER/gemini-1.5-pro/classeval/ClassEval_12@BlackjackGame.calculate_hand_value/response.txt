<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method, a new BlackjackGame object is created. This initializes a deck of cards and shuffles them. Then, a hand is defined with the cards 'JS', 'QS', 'AS', 'AS', 'AS'. The calculate_hand_value method of the BlackjackGame object is then called with this hand.

Inside the calculate_hand_value method:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `value` is initialized to 0, which will store the numerical value of the hand.
   - `num_aces` is initialized to 0, which will track the number of Aces in the hand.

2. **Card Iteration:**
   - The code iterates through each card in the hand.
   - For 'JS' and 'QS', the rank is 'J' and 'Q' respectively, which are assigned a value of 10 each, adding 20 to `value`.
   - For each 'AS', the rank is 'A', which is initially assigned a value of 11, adding 33 to `value`. `num_aces` is incremented to 3.

3. **Ace Adjustment:**
   - At this point, `value` is 53. Since this is greater than 21, and there are Aces in the hand (`num_aces` > 0), the code enters the `while` loop.
   - For each Ace, 10 is subtracted from `value` and `num_aces` is decremented by 1 until `value` is less than or equal to 21.
   - After three iterations of the loop, `value` becomes 23 (53 - 10 - 10 -10) and `num_aces` becomes 0.

4. **Return Value:**
   - The final value of the hand, 13, is returned.
