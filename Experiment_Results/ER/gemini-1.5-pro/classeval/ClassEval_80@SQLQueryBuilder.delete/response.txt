<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method, the SQLQueryBuilder.delete('items', {'name': 'bbb'}) method is invoked. The purpose of this method is to construct a SQL DELETE statement.

Let's break down how it generates the query:

1. **Initial query:** It starts with `query = f"DELETE FROM {table}"` which results in `query = "DELETE FROM items"`

2. **Handling the 'where' clause:**
   - The `if where:` condition is met because `where={'name': 'bbb'}` is provided.
   - Inside the loop: 
     - It iterates through the `where` dictionary, creating a string `"name='bbb'"`.
   - This string is then appended to the query with `query += " WHERE " + "name='bbb'"` resulting in the final query.

<<<Output>>>
DELETE FROM items WHERE name='bbb'
