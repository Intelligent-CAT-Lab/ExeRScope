Inside the test() method:
1. An instance of the MetricsCalculator class is created and assigned to the variable 'mc'.
2. The f1_score() method of the 'mc' object is called with the arguments [1, 1, 0, 0] for predicted_labels and [1, 0, 0, 1] for true_labels. The return value of this method is assigned to the variable 'temp'.
3. Inside the f1_score() method:
    - The update() method is called to update the confusion matrix based on the provided predicted and true labels.
    - After updating, the values of true_positives, false_positives, true_negatives, and false_negatives would be 1, 1, 1, and 1, respectively.
    - The precision() and recall() methods are called to calculate the precision and recall values.
    - The precision() method calculates precision as true_positives / (true_positives + false_positives) which is 1/(1+1) = 0.5.
    - The recall() method calculates recall as true_positives / (true_positives + false_negatives) which is 1/(1+1) = 0.5.
    - Finally, the f1_score is calculated as (2 * precision * recall) / (precision + recall) which is (2 * 0.5 * 0.5) / (0.5 + 0.5) = 0.5.
4. The f1_score, which is 0.5, is returned from the f1_score() method and assigned to the 'temp' variable.
5. The 'temp' variable, holding the value 0.5, is then returned from the test() method.
