<<<Analysis>>>
1. Inside the `test()` method, a `BookManagement` object is created and assigned to the variable `bookManagement`. 
2. `bookManagement.add_book("book1", 2)` is called:
    - Since "book1" is not yet in the inventory, a new entry is created with a quantity of 2: `{"book1": 2}`.
3. `bookManagement.add_book("book1")` is called:
    - "book1" is already in the inventory, so the existing quantity is incremented by 1 (default value): `{"book1": 3}`.
4. Finally, `bookManagement.inventory` is returned, which currently holds the dictionary `{"book1": 3}`.

<<<Output>>>
{'book1': 3}
