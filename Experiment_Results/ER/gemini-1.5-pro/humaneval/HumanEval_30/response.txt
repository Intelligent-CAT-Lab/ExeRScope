<<<Analysis>>>
The function `get_positive` takes a list `l` as input. 
It uses list comprehension to iterate through each element `e` in the list `l`.
For each element `e`, it checks if `e` is greater than 0. 
If `e` is greater than 0, it is included in the new list that is being constructed.
Finally, the function returns the new list which contains only the positive elements from the input list `l`.
In this specific case, the input list is `[-1, -2, 4, 5, 6]`. The function will identify that 4, 5, and 6 are the only elements greater than 0 and return a new list containing only these elements. 
<<<Output>>>
[4, 5, 6]
