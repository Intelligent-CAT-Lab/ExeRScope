<<<Analysis>>>
The function `same_chars` takes two strings as input, `s0` and `s1`. 
- First, `set(s0)` will create a set of unique characters from string  `eabcdzzzz`, which results in `{'e', 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'z'}`. 
- Similarly,  `set(s1)` will create a set of unique characters from string `dddzzzzzzzddeddabc`, which also results in `{'e', 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'z'}`.
- Finally, the code compares these two sets using `==`. Since both sets contain the same unique characters, the comparison returns `True`.

<<<Output>>>
True
