1. **Initialization**:
   - `lst` is initialized with the list `[5, 5, 5, 5, 1]`.
   - `frq` is created as a list filled with zeros, with a size equal to the maximum value in `lst` plus 1 (which is 6 in this case). So, `frq` is initialized as `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.
   - `ans` is initialized to -1. This variable will store the final result.

2. **Frequency Calculation**:
   - The code iterates through each element `i` in `lst`. 
   - For each `i`, it increments the value at the corresponding index `i` in the `frq` list by 1. This essentially counts the frequency of each element in `lst`.
   - After this loop, `frq` becomes `[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 4]`, indicating that '1' appears once and '5' appears four times in `lst`.

3. **Finding the Answer**:
   - The code iterates through the `frq` list from index 1 (ignoring index 0).
   - For each index `i`, it checks if the frequency at that index (`frq[i]`) is greater than or equal to the index itself (`i`). 
   - If the condition is true, it means there are at least `i` occurrences of the element `i`. In this case, the condition is met when `i` is 1 (frequency 1 >= index 1), so `ans` is updated to 1.
   - The loop continues, but no other index satisfies the condition.

4. **Return Value**:
   - The function returns the final value of `ans`, which is 1.
