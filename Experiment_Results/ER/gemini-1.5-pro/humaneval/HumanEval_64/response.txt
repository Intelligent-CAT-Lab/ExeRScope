<<<Analysis>>>
1. The function `vowels_count` takes a string `s` as input, in this case, "abcde".
2. It initializes a string `vowels` containing both lowercase and uppercase vowels.
3. It then calculates `n_vowels` using a generator expression and the `sum` function. The generator expression `(c in vowels for c in s)` iterates through each character `c` in the string `s`. For each character, it checks if it's present in the `vowels` string. This results in a sequence of True/False values (True if the character is a vowel, False otherwise). The `sum` function then adds up all the True values (which are implicitly treated as 1), effectively counting how many vowels are in the string.
4. It then checks if the last character `s[-1]` of the string is 'y' or 'Y'. In this case, the last character is 'e', so this condition is False.
5.  The function returns `n_vowels`, which represents the number of vowels counted in the string "abcde".
