<<<Analysis>>>
1. The function `simplify` takes two strings as input,  '1/5' and '5/1', which represent fractions.
2. Inside the function:
    - It splits both input strings by '/' using `split("/")`.
    - `a` becomes '1', `b` becomes '5',  `c` becomes '5', and `d` becomes '1'.
    - It calculates `numerator` as 1 * 5 = 5.
    - It calculates `denominator` as 5 * 1 = 5.
    - It checks if `numerator/denominator` (which is 5/5 = 1) is an integer. 
    - Since 1 is an integer, the condition `numerator/denom == int(numerator/denom)` evaluates to `True`.
    - The function returns `True`.
<<<Output>>>
True
