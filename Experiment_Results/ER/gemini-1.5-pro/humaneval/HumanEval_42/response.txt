<<<Analysis>>>
The function `incr_list` takes a list `l` as input. It uses a list comprehension to create a new list where each element is one greater than the corresponding element in the input list.
For the given input `[5, 2, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123]`, the list comprehension iterates over each element and adds 1 to it.
<<<Output>>>
[6, 3, 6, 3, 4, 4, 10, 1, 124]
