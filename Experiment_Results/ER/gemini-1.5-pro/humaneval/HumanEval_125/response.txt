1. The function `split_words` takes a string `txt` as input. In this case,  `txt` is "Hello world!".
2. The first condition checks if a space (" ") is present in the input string. Since "Hello world!" contains a space, the code inside the first `if` block will be executed.
3.  `txt.split()` is called, which splits the string at each space, resulting in a list of words: ["Hello", "world!"]. This list is returned as the output. 

<<<Output>>>
['Hello', 'world!']
