<<<Analysis>>>
1. **Initialize n and A:**
   - The function receives `n = 5` as input.
   - It creates a list `A` using list comprehension: `A = [i*i - i + 1 for i in range(1, n+1)]`. This list will store values calculated from the expression `i*i - i + 1` for each `i` from 1 to 5. So, `A` will be `[1, 3, 7, 13, 21]`.

2. **Initialize ans:**
   - An empty list `ans` is created. This list will store triples that satisfy the condition.

3. **Nested Loops for Triples:**
   - The code uses three nested loops to iterate through all possible combinations of three distinct indices `i`, `j`, and `k` from the list `A`:
     - The outer loop iterates through `i` from 0 to `n - 1` (4 in this case).
     - The middle loop iterates through `j` from `i + 1` to `n - 1`.
     - The inner loop iterates through `k` from `j + 1` to `n - 1`.
   - This ensures that we are always picking three distinct elements from `A`.

4. **Check for Divisibility by 3:**
   - Inside the innermost loop, the code calculates the sum of `A[i]`, `A[j]`, and `A[k]`. 
   - It then checks if this sum is divisible by 3 using the modulo operator (`%`).

5. **Append to ans:**
   - If the sum is divisible by 3, the triple `(A[i], A[j], A[k])` is appended to the list `ans`.

6. **Return Length of ans:**
   - After all triples have been checked, the function returns the length of the list `ans`, which represents the count of triples whose sum is divisible by 3.

Let's analyze which triples satisfy the condition:
- (1, 3, 13): 1 + 3 + 13 = 17 (not divisible by 3)
- (1, 3, 21): 1 + 3 + 21 = 25 (not divisible by 3)
- (1, 7, 13): 1 + 7 + 13 = 21 (divisible by 3)
- (1, 7, 21): 1 + 7 + 21 = 29 (not divisible by 3)
- (1, 13, 21): 1 + 13 + 21 = 35 (not divisible by 3)
- (3, 7, 13): 3 + 7 + 13 = 23 (not divisible by 3)
- (3, 7, 21): 3 + 7 + 21 = 31 (not divisible by 3)
- (3, 13, 21): 3 + 13 + 21 = 37 (not divisible by 3)
- (7, 13, 21): 7 + 13 + 21 = 41 (not divisible by 3)

Only one triple (1, 7, 13) satisfies the condition.
