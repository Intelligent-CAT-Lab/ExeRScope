<<<Analysis>>>
The function `strlen` takes a single argument, a string. It then returns the length of the string using the built-in `len` function. In this case, the string 'asdasnakj' is passed to the function. The `len` function calculates the number of characters in the string, which is 9. 
<<<Output>>>
9
