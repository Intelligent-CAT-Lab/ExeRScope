<<<Analysis>>>
The function `valid_date` takes a date string as input. 
First, it removes any leading or trailing whitespace from the input string and assigns the result back to the `date` variable.
Then, it attempts to split the `date` string into three parts using the '-' character as a separator and assigns the results to `month`, `day`, and `year`, respectively.
Next, it converts the `month`, `day`, and `year` variables to integers.
The code then checks if the `month` is between 1 and 12. 
After that, it checks if the `month` has 31 days and the `day` is between 1 and 31. In this case, March has 31 days and the day is 11, which is valid.
Finally, the code returns `True`, indicating that the input date is valid.
