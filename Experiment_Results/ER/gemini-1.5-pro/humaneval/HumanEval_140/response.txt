<<<Analysis>>>
The function `fix_spaces` aims to replace consecutive spaces in the input string 'Example' with either '-' (for more than 2 spaces) or '_' (for 1 or 2 spaces). However, since there are no spaces in the input 'Example', the code will iterate through each character and perform the following:
1. For each character, since it's not a space, the `else` block will be executed. 
2. `end` and `start` are both initialized to 0 and updated within the `else` block to be the same value as `i`. Hence, `end - start` will always be 0.
3. Therefore, for each character, the last condition in the `else` block: `new_text += text[i]` will be executed, appending the current character to `new_text`.
4. This process repeats for every character in 'Example'.
5. Finally, the code checks `end - start` again outside the loop (which will still be 0) and therefore will not append anything to `new_text`.
6. The function then returns `new_text` which is simply the original input 'Example'.
