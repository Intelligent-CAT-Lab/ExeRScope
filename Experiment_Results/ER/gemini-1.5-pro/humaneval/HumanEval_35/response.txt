<<<Analysis>>>
The function `max_element` takes a list `l` as input.
1. It initializes a variable `m` with the first element of the list: `m = l[0]` which is 1.
2. It then iterates through each element `e` in the list `l`.
3. For each element `e`, it checks if it's greater than the current value of `m`. 
    * When `e` is 2, the condition `e > m` is True (2 > 1), so `m` is updated to 2.
    * When `e` is 3, the condition `e > m` is True (3 > 2), so `m` is updated to 3.
4. After the loop completes, `m` will hold the maximum value found in the list.
5. Finally, the function returns the value of `m`.
