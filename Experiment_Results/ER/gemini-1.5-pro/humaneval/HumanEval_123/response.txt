<<<Analysis>>>
The function `get_odd_collatz(n)` takes an integer n as input and returns a sorted list called `odd_collatz` which contains all the odd numbers encountered in the Collatz sequence starting from n until n becomes 1.

1. **Initialization**: The input `n` is 14, which is even. Therefore, the list `odd_collatz` is initialized as an empty list. 
2. **Entering the loop**:
   - Since `n` (14) is greater than 1, the `while` loop is entered.
   - `n` is even (14 % 2 == 0), so `n` is updated to `n / 2` which is 7. 
   - Now `n` is odd (7 % 2 == 1), so `n` is updated to  `n * 3 + 1`, resulting in 22.
   - `n` is even (22 % 2 == 0), so `n` is updated to `n / 2`, resulting in 11.
   - `n` is odd (11 % 2 == 1), so this odd value 11 is appended to the `odd_collatz` list.  `n` is then updated to  `n * 3 + 1`, resulting in 34.
   - `n` is even (34 % 2 == 0), so `n` is updated to `n / 2`, resulting in 17.
   - `n` is odd (17 % 2 == 1), so this odd value 17 is appended to the `odd_collatz` list.   `n` is then updated to  `n * 3 + 1`, resulting in 52.
   - The process continues, and the odd values encountered (5, 17, 1) are appended to the `odd_collatz` list. 
3. **Loop Termination**: The loop continues until `n` becomes 1. At that point, the loop condition breaks.
4. **Sorting and Returning**: Finally, the `odd_collatz` list, now containing [11, 17, 5, 1], is sorted in ascending order and returned as [1, 5, 11, 17].
