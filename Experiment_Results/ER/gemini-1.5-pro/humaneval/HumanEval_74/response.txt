<<<Analysis>>>
The function `total_match` takes two lists, `lst1` and `lst2`, as input. 
1. It first initializes two variables `l1` and `l2` to 0. 
2. Then, it iterates through each string in `lst1`, calculating the length of each string using `len(st)` and adding it to `l1`. For the input `['hi', 'admin']`, `l1` would be calculated as 2 (for "hi") + 5 (for "admin") = 7.
3. Similarly, it iterates through each string in `lst2`, calculating the length of each string and adding it to `l2`. For the input `['hi', 'hi']`, `l2` would be calculated as 2 (for "hi") + 2 (for "hi") = 4.
4. Finally, it compares `l1` and `l2`. If `l1` is less than or equal to `l2`, it returns `lst1`. Otherwise, it returns `lst2`. In this case, since `l1` (7) is greater than `l2` (4), the function will return `lst2`.
