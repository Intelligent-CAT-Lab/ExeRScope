1. **Function Definition:** The code defines a function called `add_elements` that takes two arguments: `arr` (a list of integers) and `k` (an integer). 
2. **Input:** The function is called with `arr = [1,-2,-3,41,57,76,87,88,99]` and `k = 3`.
3. **Slicing:** Inside the function, `arr[:k]` slices the input list `arr`, taking elements from the beginning up to (but not including) the index `k`. So, `arr[:3]` results in a new list: `[1, -2, -3]`.
4. **Filtering:** The code uses a generator expression to iterate through the sliced list `[1, -2, -3]`. For each `elem` in this list:
    - `len(str(elem)) <= 2` checks if the length of the string representation of the element is less than or equal to 2. This means it only considers numbers that have at most two digits.
    - Only if this condition is true, the element (`elem`) is included for the next step.
5. **Summation:** The `sum(...)` function calculates the sum of all elements that passed the filtering condition in the previous step. In this case, all elements (1, -2, -3) have at most two digits and are included in the sum.
6. **Return Value:** The function returns the calculated sum.

Therefore, the function will add 1, -2, and -3.
