<<<Analysis>>>
The function fib4 takes an integer n as input and aims to calculate a modified Fibonacci sequence where each number is the sum of the previous four numbers.

1. Initialization:
    - A list `results` is initialized with [0, 0, 2, 0]. This list will store the calculated sequence values.
    - It checks if n is less than 4. If it is, the function returns the value at index n from the `results` list. This handles cases where n is 0, 1, 2, or 3.

2. Loop for n >= 4:
    - If n is 4 or greater, the code enters a loop that iterates from 4 to n (inclusive).
    - In each iteration:
        - It calculates the sum of the last four elements in the `results` list.
        - This sum is appended to the end of the `results` list.
        - The first element (index 0) is removed from the `results` list using `results.pop(0)`. This keeps the list size constant and ensures we're always summing the last four elements.

3. Returning the Result:
    - After the loop completes, the function returns the last element of the `results` list (`results[-1]`), which represents the calculated value for `fib4(n)`.

For fib4(5):
    -  The loop runs once for `_ in range(4, 6):`
        -  The sum of the last four elements (0+0+2+0 = 2) is appended to the `result` list, making it [0, 2, 0, 2]. 
        - The first element is removed, so `result` becomes [2, 0, 2].
    - The loop ends, and the function returns the last element of `result`, which is 2.
