<<<Analysis>>>
1. The function `fruit_distribution` takes two arguments: a string `s` and an integer `n`.
2. Inside the function, an empty list called `lis` is created.
3. The code then iterates through each word in the string `s` (words are separated by spaces).
4. For each word, it checks if the word is a digit using `isdigit()`. 
5. If the word is a digit, it is converted to an integer using `int()` and appended to the `lis`.
6. After processing all the words, the code calculates the sum of elements in `lis` using `sum(lis)`.
7. Finally, the function returns the difference between `n` and the sum calculated in the previous step. 

Therefore, for the input `fruit_distribution("5 apples and 6 oranges", 19)`, the function will return `19 - (5 + 6) = 8`.
