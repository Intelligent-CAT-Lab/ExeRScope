<<<Analysis>>>
1. The function `median(l: list)` takes a list `l` as input.
2. Inside the function, the input list `l` is first sorted using `sorted(l)`. So, the list becomes `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
3. It then checks if the length of the list is odd using `len(l) % 2 == 1`. In this case, the length of the list is 5, which is odd. 
4. As the length is odd, it calculates the middle index using `len(l) // 2`, which gives us 2. 
5. The element at the middle index (2) is then returned. So it will return the element at index 2 of the sorted list, which is 3.
