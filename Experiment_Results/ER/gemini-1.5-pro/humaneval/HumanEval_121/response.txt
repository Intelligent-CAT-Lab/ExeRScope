<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called `solution` that takes a list `lst` as input. It then uses a list comprehension to iterate through the list and select elements that meet certain conditions. Let's break down how it works with the given input `[5, 8, 7, 1]`:

1. **Initialization:** 
   - The input list is `[5, 8, 7, 1]`.

2. **List Comprehension:**
   - `[x for idx, x in enumerate(lst) if idx % 2 == 0 and x % 2 == 1]`: This part generates a new list.
     - `enumerate(lst)`: This iterates through the list `lst` and returns both the index and value of each element. For example, for the element `5` at index `0`, it would return `(0, 5)`.
     - `idx % 2 == 0 and x % 2 == 1`: This condition checks if the index (`idx`) is even and the value (`x`) is odd. 
     - `x`: If the condition is true, the value (`x`) is included in the new list.

3. **Filtering based on conditions:**
   - For the given list, the list comprehension will filter elements as follows:
     -  (0, 5): index 0 is even, and 5 is odd, so 5 is included.
     -  (1, 8): index 1 is odd, so 8 is not included.
     -  (2, 7): index 2 is even, and 7 is odd, so 7 is included.
     -  (3, 1): index 3 is odd, so 1 is not included.

4. **Summation:**
   - The `sum()` function then calculates the sum of the elements in the filtered list, which is `[5, 7]`.

5. **Return Value:**
   - Finally, the function returns the sum, which is `12`.
