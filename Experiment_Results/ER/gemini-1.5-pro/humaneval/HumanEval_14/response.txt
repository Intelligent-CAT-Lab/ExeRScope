<<<Analysis>>>
The function `all_prefixes` takes a string `string` as input and aims to return a list of all possible prefixes of that string.

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `result = []`: An empty list called `result` is created to store the prefixes.

2. **Looping through String**:
   - `for i in range(len(string)):`: The code iterates over each character's index `i` in the input `string`.
   - In this case, `len(string)` is 6 (length of "asdfgh"), so the loop will run for `i` values of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. 

3. **Slicing and Appending**:
   - `result.append(string[:i+1])`: In each iteration:
     - `string[:i+1]`: This slices the input string from the beginning (`0` index) up to and including the character at index `i`.
     - `result.append(...)`: This slice, representing a prefix, is appended to the `result` list.

4. **Return**:
   - `return result`: Finally, the function returns the `result` list containing all the generated prefixes.

Let's illustrate with the input "asdfgh":

   - `i = 0`: `string[:1]` -> "a" is added to `result`.
   - `i = 1`: `string[:2]` -> "as" is added to `result`.
   - `i = 2`: `string[:3]` -> "asd" is added to `result`.
   - and so on...

<<<Output>>>
['a', 'as', 'asd', 'asdf', 'asdfg', 'asdfgh']
