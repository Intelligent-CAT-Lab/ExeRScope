<<<Analysis>>>
The function `string_sequence` takes an integer `n` as input.
1. Inside the function, it first creates a list using list comprehension - `[str(x) for x in range(n + 1)]`. This part generates a list of numbers from 0 to n (inclusive) and converts each number to a string. In this case, n is 0, so the list will be ['0'].
2. Then, it uses the `' '.join()` method to concatenate the elements of the list, separated by a space. 

Therefore, the function will return a string "0".
