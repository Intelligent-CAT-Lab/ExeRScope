<<<Analysis>>>
1. The function `even_odd_count` takes an integer `num` as input. In this case, `num = 7`.
2. It initializes two variables, `even_count` and `odd_count`, to 0. These will store the count of even and odd digits in the number.
3. It then converts the absolute value of the input number to a string using `str(abs(num))`. For `num = 7`, this results in the string "7".
4. The code then iterates through each character (digit) in the string.
5. For each digit, it converts it back to an integer using `int(i)` and checks if it's divisible by 2 using `% 2 == 0`. 
6. If the digit is divisible by 2, it increments `even_count` by 1. Otherwise, it increments `odd_count` by 1.
7. Since the only digit in "7" is 7, which is not divisible by 2, `odd_count` will be incremented to 1.
8. Finally, the function returns a tuple containing `even_count` and `odd_count`, which will be (0, 1) in this case. 

<<<Output>>>
(0, 1)
