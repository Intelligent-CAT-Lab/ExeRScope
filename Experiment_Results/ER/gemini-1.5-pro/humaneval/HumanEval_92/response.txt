<<<Analysis>>>
The function any_int() takes three arguments: x, y, and z. 
1. It first checks if all three arguments are integers using isinstance(). In this case, 2, 3, and 1 are all integers, so this condition is True.
2. Next, it checks if any two of the numbers add up to the third. - 2 + 3 == 5 != 1
                                                                  - 2 + 1 == 3 == 3 
                                                                  - 3 + 1 == 4 != 2
   Since 2 + 1 equals 3, the condition (x + z == y) is True.
3. Since at least one of the conditions within the second if statement is True, the function returns True.
