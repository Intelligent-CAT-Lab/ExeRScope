<<<Analysis>>>
1. **Initialization:**
   - The function `fizz_buzz(n: int)` is defined, taking an integer `n` as input.
   - An empty list `ns` is created to store numbers divisible by 11 or 13.
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to 0, which will later store the count of the digit '7'.

2. **Iterating and Identifying Divisibility:**
   - The code enters a `for` loop, iterating from 0 up to (but not including) `n` (which is 50 in this case).
   - In each iteration, it checks if the current number `i` is divisible by either 11 or 13 using the modulo operator (`%`). 
   - If `i` satisfies the divisibility condition, it's appended to the list `ns`.

3. **Concatenating and Counting:**
   - After the loop, the code converts each number in the list `ns` into a string using `map(str, ns)`.
   - These strings are then joined together without any separator using `''.join(...)`, forming a single string `s`.
   - Another `for` loop iterates through each character `c` in the string `s`.
   - For each character, it checks if it's equal to '7'. If it is, the `ans` counter is incremented by 1.

4. **Returning the Count:**
   - Finally, the function returns the value of `ans`, which represents the total count of the digit '7' found in the concatenated string of numbers divisible by 11 or 13 within the range 0 to 49.

Applying this to the input `fizz_buzz(50)`:

- The loop will run from 0 to 49.
- Numbers like 0, 11, 22, 33, 44, 13, 26, 39 will be added to `ns`.
- The concatenated string `s` will be '011223344132639'.
- There is one '7' present in the string.
