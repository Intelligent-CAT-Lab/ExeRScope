<<<Analysis>>>
The function `max_fill` takes a list of lists representing the grid and the capacity as input. In this case, the grid is [[0,0,1,0], [0,1,0,0], [1,1,1,1]] and the capacity is 1.
- The code uses a list comprehension to iterate through each row in the grid. 
- For each row (`arr`), it calculates the sum of its elements (`sum(arr)`) and divides it by the capacity (`capacity`).
- The `math.ceil` function then rounds this result up to the nearest integer. This represents the number of times the capacity needs to be filled for that row.
- Finally, the code sums up the results from each row to get the total number of times the capacity needs to be filled for the entire grid.
Therefore, for the given input, the output will be 6.
