<<<Analysis>>>
1. The function `sort_even` takes a list `l` as input. In this case, `l` is `[1, 2, 3]`.
2. It extracts the elements at even indices into the `evens` list and the elements at odd indices into the `odds` list.
   - `evens` will be `[1, 3]` (1st and 3rd elements of `l`).
   - `odds` will be `[2]` (2nd element of `l`).
3. It sorts the `evens` list in ascending order.
   - `evens` becomes `[1, 3]`.
4. It initializes an empty list called `ans` which will store the sorted result.
5. It iterates through `evens` and `odds` simultaneously using `zip`. For each pair `(e, o)`:
   - It extends the `ans` list by appending `e` and `o`.
   - After the loop, `ans` will be `[1, 2, 3]`.
6. It checks if the length of `evens` is greater than the length of `odds`. If it is, it appends the last element of `evens` to `ans`. In this case, the lengths are equal so this step is skipped.
7. Finally, the function returns the `ans` list, which is `[1, 2, 3]`.
8. The returned list `[1, 2, 3]` is then converted to a tuple using `tuple()`.

<<<Output>>>
(1, 2, 3)
