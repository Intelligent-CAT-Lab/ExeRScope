<<<Analysis>>>
The function even_odd_palindrome takes an integer n (in this case 123) as input and returns a tuple containing the count of even and odd palindromes within the range from 1 to n. 

1. **Initialization**:
   - `even_palindrome_count` and `odd_palindrome_count` are initialized to 0. These variables will keep track of the number of even and odd palindromes encountered.

2. **Iterating through Numbers**:
   - The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 123.

3. **Checking for Palindromes and Even/Odd**:
   - For each number `i` in the loop:
        - It checks if `i` is odd using `i % 2 == 1`:
            - If `i` is odd, it calls the `is_palindrome(i)` function to determine if it's a palindrome. 
            - If `is_palindrome(i)` returns `True`, it increments the `odd_palindrome_count`.
        -  If `i` is not odd (meaning it's even), it checks if it's a palindrome using `is_palindrome(i)`. 
            - If `is_palindrome(i)` returns `True`, it increments the `even_palindrome_count`.

4. **Returning the Counts**:
   - After the loop finishes, the code returns a tuple containing `(even_palindrome_count, odd_palindrome_count)`.

Therefore, the code will iterate through numbers from 1 to 123. For each number, it checks if it is a palindrome. If it is, it further checks if it is even or odd and increments the corresponding count.
