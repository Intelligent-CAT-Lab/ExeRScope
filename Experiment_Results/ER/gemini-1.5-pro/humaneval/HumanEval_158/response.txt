The function `find_max` takes a list of strings `words` as input. It aims to find the lexicographically largest string among those with the maximum number of unique characters.

1. **`sorted(words, key=lambda x: (-len(set(x)), x))`**: This part sorts the input list `words`. Let's break down the sorting key:
   - **`lambda x: (-len(set(x)), x)`**: This is a lambda function that defines the sorting criteria. For each string `x` in `words`:
     - **`set(x)`**: Creates a set of unique characters present in the string `x`.
     - **`len(set(x))`**:  Calculates the number of unique characters in the string.
     - **`-len(set(x))`**:  We negate this value to sort in descending order of the number of unique characters.
     - **`(-len(set(x)), x)`**: This tuple is used as the sorting key. It sorts first by the negative count of unique characters (descending) and then lexicographically (ascending) if there's a tie in the unique character count.

2. **`[0]`**: After sorting, this selects the first element of the sorted list, which will be the lexicographically largest string with the maximum number of unique characters.

Applying this to the input `["name", "of", "string"]`:

- `"name"` has 3 unique characters: `{'n', 'a', 'm', 'e'}`.
- `"of"` has 2 unique characters: `{'o', 'f'}`.
- `"string"` has 6 unique characters: `{'s', 't', 'r', 'i', 'n', 'g'}`.

The sorting will prioritize strings with more unique characters, so `"string"` comes first. Although `"name"` and `"of"` have different unique character counts, they won't be chosen since `"string"` has the maximum count.

Therefore, the output is `"string"`.
