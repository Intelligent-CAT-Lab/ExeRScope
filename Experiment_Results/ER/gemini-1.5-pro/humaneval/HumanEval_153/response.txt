<<<Analysis>>>
The function `Strongest_Extension` aims to find the "strongest" extension among a list of strings. Strength, in this context, is defined by the difference between the count of uppercase and lowercase letters. A higher difference implies a "stronger" extension.

1. **Initialization:**
   - `strong` is initialized with the first extension, 'tEN'.
   - `my_val` is initialized with the "strength" of the first extension 'tEN'. It calculates this strength by:
      - Counting uppercase letters (1: 'E') 
      - Counting lowercase letters (2: 't', 'n')
      - Subtracting the lowercase count from the uppercase count (1 - 2 = -1) resulting in `my_val` being -1.

2. **Iteration and Comparison:**
   - The code then iterates through the list of extensions: `['tEN', 'niNE', 'eIGHt8OKe']`.
   - For each extension `s`:
     - It calculates the `val` (strength) of the current extension in the same way as it did for the initial extension.
     - It compares `val` with the current `my_val`. If `val` is greater than `my_val`:
       - It updates `strong` to be the current extension `s`.
       - It updates `my_val` to the current `val`.

3. **Result:**
   -  The loop continues this process for all extensions. 
   -  Finally, it constructs a string by concatenating `class_name` ('Watashi'), a period '.', and the `strong` extension. This resulting string is returned as the final output.

Let's analyze the strengths of each extension:

- **'tEN'**: (1 uppercase - 2 lowercase = -1)
- **'niNE'**: (2 uppercase - 2 lowercase = 0) 
- **'eIGHt8OKe'**: (3 uppercase - 4 lowercase = -1)

'niNE' has the highest strength value (0).

Therefore, the function will choose 'niNE' as the strongest extension.
