<<<Analysis>>>
The function `string_xor` takes two strings, '111000' and '101010', as input. Inside the function, it first defines a helper function 'xor' that takes two characters as arguments. It then uses `zip` to iterate over the input strings '111000' and '101010' in parallel. For each pair of characters (x, y) from the two strings, it calls the nested function `xor(x, y)`. The `xor` function returns '0' if the input characters are the same ('1' and '1' or '0' and '0') and '1' if they are different. The result of each `xor(x, y)` call is appended to a temporary list (implicitly created by the generator expression). This temporary list contains a sequence of '0's and '1's representing the bitwise XOR of the two input strings. Finally,  `''.join(...)` joins the elements of this temporary list into a single string, which becomes the return value of the function.
