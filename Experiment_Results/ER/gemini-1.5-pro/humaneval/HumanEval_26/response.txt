1. **Initialization**: The function `remove_duplicates` takes a list of integers `numbers` as input. In this case, `numbers = [1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 3, 5]`.

2. **Counting Occurrences**: It uses `collections.Counter(numbers)` to create a dictionary-like object `c` that stores the count of each number in the input list. For the given input, `c` would be `{1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 2, 4: 1, 5: 1}`.

3. **Filtering Duplicates**: The code then uses a list comprehension `[n for n in numbers if c[n] <= 1]` to iterate through the original list `numbers`. For each number `n` in the list, it checks if its count `c[n]` in the `c` dictionary is less than or equal to 1. If it is, it means the number appears only once and is included in the output list.

4. **Returning the Result**: The list comprehension results in a new list containing only the unique elements from the input list, which is then returned by the function.
