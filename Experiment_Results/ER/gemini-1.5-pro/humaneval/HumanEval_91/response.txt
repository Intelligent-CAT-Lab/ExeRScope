<<<Analysis>>>
First, the input string "Hello world" is split into sentences using re.split(r'[.?!]\s*', S).  Since there are no sentence delimiters (.?!) in the input string, the result is a list containing a single element: ["Hello world"].

Next, the code iterates through each sentence in the list (in this case, there's only one: "Hello world"). 

For each sentence, it checks if the first two characters are "I ". Since "Hello world" does not start with "I ", the condition sentence[0:2] == 'I ' evaluates to False.

The sum function then adds up the boolean values. Since there's only one sentence and it resulted in False (which is equivalent to 0 in this context), the sum will be 0.

Finally, the function returns 0, indicating that there were no sentences starting with "I " in the input string.
<<<Output>>>
0
