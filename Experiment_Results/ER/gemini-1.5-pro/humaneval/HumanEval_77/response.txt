<<<Analysis>>>
The function `iscube(a)` aims to determine if the input integer `a` is a perfect cube. 

1. **Initialization:** `a` is initialized with the value 1.
2. **Absolute Value:** The line `a = abs(a)` calculates the absolute value of `a`. Since `a` is already 1, the absolute value remains 1. 
3. **Cube Root Calculation:** `a ** (1. / 3)` calculates the cube root of `a`. The cube root of 1 is 1.
4. **Rounding:** `round(a ** (1. / 3))` rounds the result of the cube root calculation to the nearest integer, which is still 1.
5. **Cubing and Comparison:** The rounded cube root (1 in this case) is then cubed using `** 3`. The result (1*1*1 = 1) is compared to the original absolute value of `a` (which is also 1). 
6. **Return Value:** Since the cubed rounded cube root (1) is equal to the original absolute value (1), the function returns `True`.
