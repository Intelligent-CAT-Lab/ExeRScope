<<<Analysis>>>
The function `sum_to_n` takes an integer `n` as input. 
1. Inside the function, `range(n + 1)` generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to `n` (inclusive). In this case,  `range(1 + 1)` generates 0, 1.
2. The `sum()` function then calculates the sum of all the numbers in this sequence.
3. This sum (0 + 1 = 1) is returned as the output of the function.
