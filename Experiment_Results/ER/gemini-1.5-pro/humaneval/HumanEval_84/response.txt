<<<Analysis>>>
1. The function `solve` takes an integer `N` (in this case 1000) as input.
2. Inside the function, `str(N)` converts the integer `N` into a string: "1000".
3. `int(i) for i in str(N)` is a generator expression that iterates through each character in the string "1000" and converts it back to an integer. So it generates the sequence: 1, 0, 0, 0.
4. `sum(...)` calculates the sum of the generated sequence (1 + 0 + 0 + 0), resulting in 1.
5. `bin(...)` converts the sum (which is 1) into its binary representation, resulting in "0b1".
6. Finally, `[2:]` slices the binary string, removing the "0b" prefix, leaving just "1".
