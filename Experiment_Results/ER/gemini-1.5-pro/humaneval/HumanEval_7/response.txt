<<<Analysis>>>
The function `filter_by_substring` takes two arguments: a list of strings called `strings` and a string called `substring`. The goal of the function is to return a new list containing only the strings from the input list that contain the given `substring`.

In this specific case, the input list `strings` is empty (`[]`), meaning there are no strings to check for the substring. 

The code uses a list comprehension, which iterates through each element in `strings`. However, since `strings` is empty, the loop won't run at all.  Therefore, no strings will be evaluated for containing the substring "john".

As a result, the function will return an empty list because no strings from the input met the condition of containing the substring.
