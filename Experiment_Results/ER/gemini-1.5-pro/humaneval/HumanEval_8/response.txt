<<<Analysis>>>
The function `sum_product` takes a list of integers as input and calculates the sum and product of all the elements in the list. 
1. It initializes two variables,  `sum_value`  and `prod_value`, to 0 and 1 respectively.
2. It then iterates through each element in the input list `numbers`.
3. For each element `n` in the list:
    - It adds the element  `n` to `sum_value`.
    - It multiplies the element `n` with `prod_value`.
4. After processing all elements in the list, the function returns a tuple containing `sum_value` and `prod_value`.
In this specific case, the input list is `[1, 1, 1]`.  Therefore:
- The loop will iterate three times.
- In each iteration, `sum_value` will be incremented by 1, and `prod_value` will be multiplied by 1. 
- Finally, the function will return the tuple `(3, 1)`, representing the sum and product of the elements in the list.
