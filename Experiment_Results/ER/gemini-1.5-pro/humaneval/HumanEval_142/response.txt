1. The function `sum_squares` takes a list `lst` as input, in this case, `[1, 2, 3]`.
2. It initializes an empty list called `result`.
3. It then iterates through the list using the index `i`.
    * When `i = 0`:
        * `i % 3 == 0` is True.
        * `1**2` (1 squared) is appended to `result`. So `result` becomes `[1]`
    * When `i = 1`:
        * Both conditions `i % 3 == 0` and  `i % 4 == 0 and i % 3 != 0` are False.
        * The element `2` is appended to `result`. So `result` becomes `[1, 2]`.
    * When `i = 2`: 
        * Both conditions `i % 3 == 0` and  `i % 4 == 0 and i % 3 != 0` are False.
        * The element `3` is appended to `result`. So `result` becomes `[1, 2, 3]`.
4.  Finally, the function calculates the sum of all elements in `result` (`1 + 2 + 3`) which equals `6`.
