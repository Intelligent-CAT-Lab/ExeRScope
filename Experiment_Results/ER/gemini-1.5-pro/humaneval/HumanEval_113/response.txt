1. The function `odd_count` takes a list of strings as input, in this case, `['1234567']`.
2. It initializes an empty list called `res` to store the results.
3. The code then iterates through each string in the input list. For each string `arr` (in this case, there's only one: '1234567'):
    - It initializes a variable `n` to 0. This variable will count the number of odd digits in the current string.
    - It then iterates through each character/digit `d` in the string `arr`.
    - For each digit `d`, it checks if it's odd using `int(d) % 2 == 1`. If it is, it increments `n` by 1.
    - After processing all digits in the string, `n` will hold the total count of odd digits. 
    - Finally, it constructs a string using the calculated value of `n` and appends it to the `res` list.
4. The function returns the `res` list.

Since the input string '1234567' has four odd digits (1, 3, 5, and 7), the output will be: 

<<<Output>>>
```
['the number of odd elements 4n the str4ng 4 of the 4nput.']
