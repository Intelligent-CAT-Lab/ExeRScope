<<<Analysis>>>
The function `make_a_pile` takes an integer `n` as input.
It uses a list comprehension to generate a list.
The list comprehension iterates through a range of numbers from 0 to `n` (exclusive), so in this case 0, 1, and 2.
For each number `i` in the range, it calculates `n + 2*i` and adds it to the list.
 * When i = 0:  3 + 2 * 0 = 3
 * When i = 1:  3 + 2 * 1 = 5
 * When i = 2:  3 + 2 * 2 = 7
Finally, the function returns the generated list [3, 5, 7].
<<<Output>>>
[3, 5, 7]
