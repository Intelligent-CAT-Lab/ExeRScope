<<<Analysis>>>
The function `largest_divisor(n: int) -> int:` aims to find the largest divisor of a given integer `n`. 

1. **Initialization:** `n` is initialized to 3.
2. **Iteration:** The code iterates in reversed order through a range of numbers from `n` (exclusive) down to 0 (inclusive).  This means it checks 2, 1, and then 0.
3. **Divisibility Check:** Inside the loop, `if n % i == 0:` checks if `n` is perfectly divisible by the current number `i`. 
    - When `i` is 2,  `3 % 2` is not 0, so the condition is not met.
    - When `i` is 1, `3 % 1` is 0, meaning 3 is divisible by 1. 
4. **Return:** Since 3 is divisible by 1, the code returns `i`, which is currently 1.
