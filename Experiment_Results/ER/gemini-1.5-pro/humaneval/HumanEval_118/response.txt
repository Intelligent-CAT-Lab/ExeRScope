<<<Analysis>>>
The function `get_closest_vowel` aims to find a vowel in the input word that is not adjacent to another vowel. It iterates through the word from the second to last character to the second character, skipping the first and last.

1. **Initialization:**
   - The input `word` is "yogurt".
   - The `vowels` set is initialized.

2. **Looping through the word:**
   - The loop starts at index 3 (len(word)-2) which corresponds to the letter 'u' in "yogurt".
   - **Iteration 1 (i=3):** 
     - `word[i]` is 'u', which is in `vowels`.
     - `word[i+1]` is 'r', not in `vowels`.
     - `word[i-1]` is 'g', not in `vowels`.
     - The conditions are met, so the function returns 'u'.

3. **Return:**
   - The function returns 'u' before examining the rest of the word.

<<<Output>>>
u
