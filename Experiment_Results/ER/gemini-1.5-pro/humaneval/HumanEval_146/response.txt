1. The function `specialFilter` takes a list of numbers `nums` as input.
2. A counter variable `count` is initialized to 0.
3. The code iterates through each number `num` in the `nums` list.
4. For each `num`, it checks if it's greater than 10. 
    - The input list `[5, -2, 1, -5]` has no numbers greater than 10, so the condition is never met.
5. Since none of the numbers meet the condition, the code within the if statement is never executed.
6. Finally, the function returns the value of `count`, which remains 0 throughout the process.
