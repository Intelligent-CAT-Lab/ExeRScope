<<<Analysis>>>
The function `decimal_to_binary` takes an integer `decimal` as input and returns its binary representation enclosed within "db" at the beginning and the end.
1. The code first calls the built-in function `bin(decimal)` which returns the binary representation of 0 as '0b0'.
2. Then `bin(decimal)[2:]` slices the obtained binary representation, removing the first two characters ('0b') resulting in '0'.
3. Finally, the code concatenates "db" at the beginning and end of the sliced binary representation, resulting in "db0db".
<<<Output>>>
db0db
