<<<Analysis>>>
The function `is_nested` takes a string as input, which is expected to contain only square brackets. It aims to determine if there are at least two nested levels of brackets.

1. **Initialization:**
   - `opening_bracket_index`: An empty list to store the indices of opening brackets '['.
   - `closing_bracket_index`: An empty list to store the indices of closing brackets ']'.

2. **Iterating through the string:**
   - The code iterates through each character of the input string.
   - If the character is a '[': its index is appended to `opening_bracket_index`.
   - If the character is a ']', its index is appended to `closing_bracket_index`.
     - For the input "[[]]", `opening_bracket_index` will be [0, 1] and `closing_bracket_index` will be [3, 2].

3. **Reversing closing bracket indices:**
   - The `closing_bracket_index` list is reversed in-place using `reverse()`. 
     - Now, `closing_bracket_index` becomes [2, 3].

4. **Checking for Nested Brackets:**
   - `cnt`: Initialized to 0, this variable will count the number of nested bracket pairs.
   - `i`: Initialized to 0, this is a counter to iterate through `closing_bracket_index`.
   - `l`: Stores the length of `closing_bracket_index`.
   - The code iterates through each index in `opening_bracket_index`. 
     - For each opening bracket index (`idx`), it checks if:
       - `i` is within the bounds of `closing_bracket_index` (`i < l`).
       - The current opening bracket index is less than the corresponding closing bracket index (`idx < closing_bracket_index[i]`).
       - If both conditions are true, it means we've found a nested pair:
         - `cnt` is incremented.
         - `i` is incremented to move to the next closing bracket index.
  - In our case, both opening brackets (at index 0 and 1) will satisfy the conditions and cnt will become 2.

5. **Return Value:**
   - Finally, the function returns `True` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2 (meaning at least two nested pairs were found), otherwise it returns `False`.
   - As cnt is 2 the function returns True.
