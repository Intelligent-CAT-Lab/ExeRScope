<<<Analysis>>>
The function `prime_fib(n)` aims to find the nth prime number in the Fibonacci sequence.

1. **Initialization:**
   - `n` is initialized to 1, meaning we want to find the 1st prime Fibonacci number.
   - `f` is initialized as a list containing the first two Fibonacci numbers: `[0, 1]`.

2. **Looping for Prime Fibonacci:**
   - The code enters a `while True` loop, which continues indefinitely until a `return` statement is encountered.
   - Inside the loop:
     - **Generate Next Fibonacci:** It calculates the next Fibonacci number by adding the last two numbers in the `f` list: `f.append(f[-1] + f[-2])`.
     - **Check for Primality:** It calls the `is_prime` function to check if the newly generated Fibonacci number (`f[-1]`) is prime.
     - **Decrement `n` if Prime:** If `f[-1]` is prime, the code decrements `n` by 1. This keeps track of how many more prime Fibonacci numbers we need to find.
     - **Check if `n` is Zero:** If `n` reaches 0, it means we have found the nth prime Fibonacci number, and the loop breaks by returning the last element of `f` (`f[-1]`).

3. **Finding the Prime:**
   - The loop continues until `n` becomes 0. In this case, since we are looking for the 1st prime Fibonacci number, the loop will terminate after the first prime is found.

4. **Output:**
   - The code will return `2` as it's the first prime number in the Fibonacci sequence.
