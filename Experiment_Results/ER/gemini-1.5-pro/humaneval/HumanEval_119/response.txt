<<<Analysis>>>
The function `match_parens` takes a list `lst` of two strings containing parentheses as input. In this case, `lst = ['()(', ')']`.

1. **String Construction:**
   - It first constructs two strings: 
      - `S1 = lst[0] + lst[1] = '()(' + ')' = '()()'`
      - `S2 = lst[1] + lst[0] = ')' + '()(' = ')()('`

2. **Function `check(s)`:**
    - This nested function checks if a string `s` has balanced parentheses.
    - It initializes a variable `val = 0`.
    - It iterates through each character `i` in the string `s`:
        - If `i` is an opening parenthesis `(`, it increments `val` by 1.
        - If `i` is a closing parenthesis `)`, it decrements `val` by 1.
        - If at any point `val` becomes negative (meaning there are more closing parentheses than opening ones), it immediately returns `False`.
    - After processing all characters, if `val` is 0 (meaning all parentheses are balanced), it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

3. **Checking `S1` and `S2`:**
   - The code calls `check(S1)` to check if the parentheses in `S1` are balanced. In this case, `check('()()')` returns `True` because `S1` has balanced parentheses.
   - Since `check(S1)` is `True`, the code doesn't need to check `S2`.

4. **Return Value:**
   - Because at least one of `check(S1)` or `check(S2)` is `True`, the function returns 'Yes'.
