<<<Analysis>>>
The function `is_prime(n)` aims to determine if a given integer `n` is a prime number. Here's how it processes the input `n = 6`:

1. **Initial Check:** It starts by checking if `n` is less than 2. Since 6 is not less than 2, it proceeds to the next step.
2. **Iteration Loop:** The code enters a `for` loop, with `k` ranging from 2 to `n - 1` (which is 5 in this case).
3. **Divisibility Check:** In each iteration, it checks if `n` (which is 6) is divisible by `k` without any remainder (`n % k == 0`). 
   - When `k` is 2, the condition `6 % 2 == 0` evaluates to `True`.
4. **Early Return:** Since 6 is divisible by 2, the function immediately returns `False`, indicating that 6 is not a prime number. The loop doesn't need to continue further.
