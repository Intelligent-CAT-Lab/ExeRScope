<<<Analysis>>>
The function `will_it_fly(q, w)` first checks if the sum of the list `q` is greater than `w`. In this case, the sum of `[3, 2, 3]` is 8, which is not greater than 9, so the code proceeds to the next step. 

The code then enters a while loop that iterates over the list `q` from both ends towards the middle, comparing the elements. 
- Initially, `i` points to the first element (3) and `j` points to the last element (3). Since `q[i]` and `q[j]` are equal, the loop continues. 
- In the next iteration, `i` is incremented to point to the second element (2) and `j` is decremented to point to the second-to-last element (2), which is still the same element in this case. Since `q[i]` and `q[j]` are equal, the loop continues. 
- Now,  `i` would be incremented to 2 and `j` decremented to 1. However, the while loop condition `i < j` is no longer met, so the loop ends.

Since all comparisons within the loop resulted in True (the list is symmetrical), the function returns True. 

<<<Output>>>
