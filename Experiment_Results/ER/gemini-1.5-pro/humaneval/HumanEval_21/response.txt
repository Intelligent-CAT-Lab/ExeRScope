<<<Analysis>>>
1. The function `rescale_to_unit` takes a list of floats called `numbers` as input. In this case, the input is [2.0, 49.9].
2. It calculates the `min_number` and `max_number` within the input list. In this case, `min_number` is 2.0 and `max_number` is 49.9.
3. It uses list comprehension to create a new list. For each number `x` in the input list, it calculates `(x - min_number) / (max_number - min_number)`. This formula scales each number to a value between 0 and 1, where 0 corresponds to the `min_number` and 1 corresponds to the `max_number`.
4. For 2.0: (2.0 - 2.0) / (49.9 - 2.0) = 0.0
5. For 49.9: (49.9 - 2.0) / (49.9 - 2.0) = 1.0
6. The function returns the new list containing the rescaled values. 

<<<Output>>>
[0.0, 1.0]
