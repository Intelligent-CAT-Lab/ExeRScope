<<<Analysis>>>
1. The function `maximum` takes two arguments: `arr` (a list of integers) and `k` (an integer).
2. It first checks if `k` is equal to 0. If it is, it returns an empty list `[]`. 
3. In this case, `k` is 3, so the code proceeds to the next step.
4. The list `arr` is sorted in ascending order using `arr.sort()`. So, `arr` becomes `[-4, -3, 5]`.
5. The code then slices the sorted list `arr` from the `-k`th element to the end using `arr[-k:]`. In this case, `-k` is `-3`, so it takes the last 3 elements of the sorted list, which are `[-4, -3, 5]`.
6. This sliced list `[-4, -3, 5]` is stored in the variable `ans`.
7. Finally, the function returns the `ans` list. 

<<<Output>>>
[-4, -3, 5]
