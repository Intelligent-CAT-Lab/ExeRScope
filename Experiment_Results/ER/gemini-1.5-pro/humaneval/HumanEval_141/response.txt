<<<Analysis>>>
The function `file_name_check` takes a file name as input and checks if it's a valid name based on:

1. **Splitting the name:** It first splits the `file_name` using '.' as a separator and stores the parts in the `lst` variable. For "example.txt", `lst` will be ["example", "txt"].

2. **Checking the length:** It then checks if the length of `lst` is not equal to 2 (meaning it should have a name and an extension). If it's not 2, it returns "No". In this case, it is 2, so it continues.

3. **Checking the extension:** It checks if the second part of `lst` (the extension) exists in the allowed suffixes list `suf`. "txt" is present in `suf`, so it continues.

4. **Checking for empty filename:** It then checks if the first part of `lst` (the actual file name) is empty. It is not ("example" is not empty), so it continues.

5. **Checking the first character of the filename:** It checks if the first character of the file name is alphabetic. In this case, the first character of "example" is 'e', which is alphabetic, so it continues.

6. **Checking the number of digits in the filename:** It counts the number of digits in the file name. "example" has no digits, so `t` would be 0. Since 0 is not greater than 3, it continues.

7. **Returning "Yes":** If all checks pass, it means the file name is valid according to the defined rules and the function returns "Yes".
