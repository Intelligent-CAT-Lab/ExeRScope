<<<Analysis>>>
The function `find_closest_elements` takes a list of floats as input and aims to find the two closest numbers within that list. It initializes two variables: `closest_pair` (initially set to None) to store the pair of closest numbers found so far and `distance` (also initially set to None) to keep track of the smallest distance encountered between any two numbers. 

The code then uses two nested loops to iterate through all possible pairs of numbers in the input list. The outer loop iterates through each number (`elem`) using its index (`idx`), while the inner loop iterates through all other numbers (`elem2`) with index `idx2`. The condition `if idx != idx2` ensures that the code doesn't compare a number with itself.

For each pair of distinct numbers, the code calculates the absolute difference between them (`new_distance`). If this is the first pair being considered (`distance` is still None), the code sets `distance` to this difference and `closest_pair` to a tuple containing the sorted pair of numbers. 

For subsequent pairs, the code compares `new_distance` with the currently stored `distance`. If `new_distance` is smaller, the code updates both `distance` and `closest_pair`. 

This process continues until all pairs have been examined, at which point `closest_pair` will contain the pair of numbers with the smallest distance found.

In the given example, the closest numbers are 2.0 and 2.2, with a difference of 0.2.
