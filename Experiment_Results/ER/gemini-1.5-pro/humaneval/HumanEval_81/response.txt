<<<Analysis>>>
The function `numerical_letter_grade` takes a list of GPAs as input. 
It initializes an empty list called `letter_grade` to store the corresponding letter grades.

The code then iterates through each GPA in the input list. 
For each GPA, it checks a series of conditions to determine the corresponding letter grade. 

For example:
* If the GPA is exactly 4.0, it appends "A+" to the `letter_grade` list.
* If the GPA is greater than 3.7 but not 4.0, it appends "A" to the `letter_grade` list.
* This continues for all the defined GPA ranges.

The process repeats for all the GPAs in the input list.
Finally, the function returns the `letter_grade` list, which contains the letter grade for each GPA in the input list.

For the input [4.0, 3, 1.7, 2, 3.5], the code will output:
* 'A+' for 4.0
* 'B+' for 3.0
* 'C' for 1.7
* 'C+' for 2.0
* 'A-' for 3.5

<<<Output>>>
['A+', 'B+', 'C', 'C+', 'A-']
