<<<Analysis>>>
1. The function `sort_array` takes a list `array` as input.
2. It first checks if the list is empty. In this case, the list is not empty, so it proceeds to the next step.
3. It calculates `(array[0] + array[-1]) % 2`. This expression adds the first and last elements of the array (15 + 0 = 15), and then takes the modulus 2 of the result (15 % 2 = 1). 
4. The result of the modulus operation (1) is then used to determine the sorting order. Since 1 is not equal to 0,  `reverse` is set to `True`.
5. The `sorted` function sorts the input array in descending order (because `reverse=True`). 
6. Finally, the sorted array is returned.
