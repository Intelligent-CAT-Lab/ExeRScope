<<<Analysis>>>
The function `is_equal_to_sum_even(n)` takes an integer `n` as input. It then checks if the remainder when `n` is divided by 2 is equal to 0 (`n % 2 == 0`) and if `n` is greater than or equal to 8 (`n >= 8`).  Both of these conditions need to be true for the function to return `True`.

In this case, `n` is 4. 

* The first condition, `4 % 2 == 0`, is True because 4 is even. 
* However, the second condition, `4 >= 8`, is False.

Since both conditions are not True, the function will return `False`.
