The function `smallest_change` takes a list `arr` as input. 
1. It initializes a variable `ans` to 0, which will store the count of changes required to make the list a palindrome.
2. It then iterates through the first half of the list using the loop `for i in range(len(arr) // 2)`. 
   - In each iteration, it compares the element at index `i` with the element at index `len(arr) - i - 1`. This effectively compares the corresponding elements from the beginning and end of the list.
   - If the elements are not equal, it increments the `ans` counter by 1, indicating that a change is needed to make them equal.
3. Finally, after iterating through half of the list, the function returns the value of `ans`.

For the input `[1, 2, 3, 5, 4, 7, 9, 6]`, the function will perform the following comparisons:

- `arr[0]` (1) vs. `arr[7]` (6) - Not equal, increment `ans` 
- `arr[1]` (2) vs. `arr[6]` (9) - Not equal, increment `ans`
- `arr[2]` (3) vs. `arr[5]` (7) - Not equal, increment `ans`
- `arr[3]` (5) vs. `arr[4]` (4) - Not equal, increment `ans`

Therefore, the function will return `4`.
