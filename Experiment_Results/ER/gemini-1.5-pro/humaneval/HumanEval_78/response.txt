<<<Analysis>>>
1. The function `hex_key` takes a string `num` as input, which is "AB" in this case.
2. It initializes a tuple `primes` containing the hexadecimal digits that are prime numbers.
3. It initializes a variable `total` to 0. This variable will store the count of prime hexadecimal digits found in the input string.
4. The code then iterates through each character of the input string `num`.
5. For each character `num[i]`, it checks if it is present in the `primes` tuple. 
6. If the character is a prime hexadecimal digit, `total` is incremented by 1.
7.  The loop continues until all characters in the input string have been processed.
8. Finally, the function returns the value of `total`, which represents the number of prime hexadecimal digits found in the input string. In this case, 'A' and 'B' both appear in the primes tuple, so the total is 2.
