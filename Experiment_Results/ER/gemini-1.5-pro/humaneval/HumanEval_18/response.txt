<<<Analysis>>>
The function `how_many_times` aims to find the number of times a substring appears in a given string. 

1. **Initialization:**
   - `times` is initialized to 0, which will store the count of substring occurrences.
   - `string` is assigned an empty string (`''`) 
   - `substring` is assigned the string `'x'`.

2. **Loop Analysis:**
   - The `for` loop is supposed to iterate through the string in a way that it checks for the substring's presence at each possible position. 
   - However, the loop condition `len(string) - len(substring) + 1` evaluates to `0 - 1 + 1 = 0`. This means the loop will not run even once. 

3. **Return:**
   - Since the loop doesn't execute, the value of `times` remains 0. 
   - The function returns `times`, which is 0.
