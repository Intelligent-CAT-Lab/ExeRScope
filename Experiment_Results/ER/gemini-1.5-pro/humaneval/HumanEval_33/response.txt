<<<Analysis>>>
1. The function `sort_third(l)` takes a list `l` as input.
2. Inside the function, `l = list(l)` creates a copy of the input list. This is done to avoid modifying the original list.
3. `l[::3]` selects every third element of the list starting from the first element. In this case, it selects only the element `1` from the list `[1, 2, 3]`.
4. `sorted(l[::3])` sorts the selected elements, which is just `[1]` in this case. Since a single-element list is already sorted, it remains as `[1]`.
5. `l[::3] = sorted(l[::3])` assigns the sorted sub-list back to the original list at every third position. So the list becomes `[1, 2, 3]`.
6. Finally, the function returns the modified list `l`.
<<<Output>>>
[1, 2, 3]
