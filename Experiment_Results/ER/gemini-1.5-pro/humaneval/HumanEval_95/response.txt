<<<Analysis>>>
The function `check_dict_case` aims to determine if all keys within the input dictionary `dict` are consistently either all uppercase or all lowercase. 

1. **Initialization:**
   - The input dictionary `{"p":"pineapple", "b":"banana"}` is passed to the function.
   - It checks if the dictionary is empty. In this case, it's not, so it proceeds.
   - `state` is initialized to "start", indicating no keys have been examined yet.

2. **Iteration:**
   - The code iterates through each key in the dictionary:
      - **Key "p":**
         - Since `state` is "start", it checks if "p" is uppercase or lowercase. As it's lowercase, `state` becomes "lower".
      - **Key "b":**
         - Now, `state` is "lower". It checks if "b" is also lowercase. It is, so the loop continues.

3. **Result:**
   - The loop completes without finding any inconsistent key cases.
   - The final check `state == "upper" or state == "lower"` evaluates to `True` because `state` is "lower".
