1. The function `sorted_list_sum` takes a list `lst` as input, which is `["aa", "a", "aaa"]` in this case.
2. Inside the function:
    -  `lst.sort()`: This line sorts the input list alphabetically, so `lst` becomes `["a", "aa", "aaa"]`.
    - `new_lst = []`: An empty list `new_lst` is created.
    - The code then iterates through each element `i` in the sorted `lst`:
       - `if len(i) % 2 == 0:`:  This condition checks if the length of the string `i` is even. 
          - If true, the string `i` is appended to `new_lst`. In our case, only "aa" has an even length (2), so it's added to `new_lst`.
    - Finally, `new_lst`, which now contains `["aa"]`, is sorted again based on the length of the strings using `sorted(new_lst, key=len)`. However, since there's only one element, the sorting doesn't change the list.
3. The function returns the `new_lst`.
<<<Output>>>
['aa']
