<<<Analysis>>>
The function fibfib(n) calculates a modified Fibonacci sequence where each number is the sum of the previous three numbers in the sequence.
When n=2, the code executes the third if statement because the first two conditions (n == 0 and n == 1) are not met. 
Therefore, the function returns 1.
