<<<Analysis>>>
1. **Input Processing:** The function receives the string 'Hi' as input.
2. **Splitting the String:** The expression `s.split(' ')` splits the input string by spaces. Since 'Hi' has no spaces, this results in a list containing a single element: `['Hi']`.
3. **Iterating and Sorting:** The code then uses a list comprehension to process each element of the split string. In this case, there's only one element ('Hi'). 
   - For the element 'Hi':
     - It's converted to a list of characters: `['H', 'i']`.
     - This list is sorted alphabetically: `['H', 'i']` (it remains the same in this case).
     - The sorted list is joined back into a string: `'Hi'`.
4. **Joining the Result:** Finally, the list comprehension returns a list containing the processed string: `['Hi']`. The `' '.join(...)` part joins the elements of this list with spaces. Since there's only one element, the output remains 'Hi'.
