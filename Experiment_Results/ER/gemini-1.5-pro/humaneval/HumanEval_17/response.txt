<<<Analysis>>>
1. **Initialization:**
   - The function `parse_music` takes a single argument `music_string` which is expected to be a string.
   - Inside the function, a dictionary `note_map` is created to store the mapping between musical notes and their corresponding durations.
2. **String Splitting:**
   - The input string `music_string` is split into a list of substrings using space (' ') as the delimiter. This is done using `music_string.split(' ')`. Since `music_string` is an empty string in this case, the result of splitting will be a list containing a single empty string: `['']`.
3. **Filtering Empty Strings:**
   - The code then uses a list comprehension to iterate through the list of substrings generated in the previous step. 
   - The `if x` condition within the list comprehension filters out any empty strings. Since the list contains only an empty string, this filtering step will remove it, resulting in an empty list.
4. **Mapping and Returning:**
   - The remaining part of the list comprehension `[note_map[x] for x ...]` would normally map each substring to its corresponding duration using the `note_map` dictionary. However, since the list is already empty after the filtering step, this part of the code doesn't have any effect.
   - Finally, the function returns the resulting list, which is an empty list in this case.
