<<<Analysis>>>
The function `unique_digits` takes a list of integers as input, in this case `[15, 33, 1422, 1]`.
- An empty list called `odd_digit_elements` is created to store numbers that meet a specific condition. 
- The code iterates through each element in the input list `x`.
- For each integer `i` in the list:
    - It converts the integer to its string representation (`str(i)`).
    - It then checks if all the digits in the string representation are odd using the `all` function and a generator expression `(int(c) % 2 == 1 for c in str(i))`. This expression checks if the remainder when each digit `c` is divided by 2 is equal to 1 (which means it's odd).
    - If all digits of the integer are odd, the integer `i` is appended to the `odd_digit_elements` list.
- Finally, the `odd_digit_elements` list, containing only the numbers with all odd digits, is sorted in ascending order using `sorted(odd_digit_elements)` and returned as the output.

Applying this to the input `[15, 33, 1422, 1]`:
- `15`: Both digits (1 and 5) are odd. It is added to `odd_digit_elements`.
- `33`: Both digits (3 and 3) are odd. It is added to `odd_digit_elements`.
- `1422`: Not all digits are odd (2 is even). It is not added.
- `1`: The digit (1) is odd. It is added to `odd_digit_elements`.

Therefore, `odd_digit_elements` will contain `[15, 33, 1]`, which when sorted becomes `[1, 15, 33]`.
