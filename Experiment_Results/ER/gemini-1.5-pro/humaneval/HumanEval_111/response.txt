<<<Analysis>>>
1. **Initialization:**
   - `dict1 = {}`: An empty dictionary `dict1` is created to store the histogram (word counts).
   - `list1 = test.split(" ")`: The input string `'a b b a'` is split at spaces and stored as a list `['a', 'b', 'b', 'a']`.
   - `t = 0`:  A variable `t` is initialized to 0. This variable will track the maximum frequency of any word encountered.

2. **Finding Maximum Frequency:**
   - The code iterates through each word `i` in `list1`.
   - For each word:
     - `if (list1.count(i) > t) and i != '':` It checks if the count of the word `i` in `list1` is greater than the current maximum frequency `t` and if the word is not empty. 
     - If both conditions are true, `t` is updated to `list1.count(i)`, which means a new maximum frequency is found.

3. **Building the Histogram:**
   - `if t > 0:`: This condition checks if any word appeared at least once (i.e., the maximum frequency `t` is greater than 0).
     - If true, the code iterates again through each word `i` in `list1`.
     - `if (list1.count(i) == t):`: For each word, it checks if its count is equal to the maximum frequency `t`. 
       - If yes, it adds the word and its count to the `dict1` as a key-value pair (e.g., `'a': 2`).

4. **Returning the Histogram:**
   - Finally, the function returns the `dict1` containing the histogram of words with the maximum frequency.

**Applying the Analysis to Input 'a b b a':**

1. `list1` will be `['a', 'b', 'b', 'a']`.
2. The maximum frequency `t` will be 2 (both 'a' and 'b' appear twice).
3. The histogram `dict1` will be built to store `{'a': 2, 'b': 2}`. 

<<<Output>>>
{'a': 2, 'b': 2}
