<<<Analysis>>>
1. The function `check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple")` is called with the string "apple" as input.
2. Inside the function, the input string `txt` is split at each space using `txt.split(' ')`, resulting in a list `['apple']`.
3.  `[-1]` selects the last element of the list, which is "apple" in this case and it is assigned to the variable `check`.
4. The code then checks if the length of the `check` is equal to 1 using `len(check) == 1` and if the ASCII value of the lowercase version of the last character  of `check`  converted using `ord(check.lower())` falls between 97 and 122 (inclusive), which corresponds to lowercase letters 'a' to 'z'.
5. Since the last character is "e" and its ASCII value is 101, which falls within the range of 97 to 122, the condition in the if statement evaluates to True.
6. Therefore, the function returns `True`.
<<<Output>>>
