<<<Analysis>>>
1. The function `prime_length` takes a string as input. In this case, the input string is 'Hello'.
2. It calculates the length (l) of the string using `len('Hello')`, which is 5.
3. It checks if the length is 0 or 1. In this case, it's not, so it proceeds to the next step.
4. It enters a loop that iterates from 2 to the length of the string (5) using `range(2, 5)`. This loop will run for values of `i` being 2, 3, and 4.
5. For each value of `i`, it checks if the length (5) is divisible by `i` without a remainder (`l % i == 0`).
   - When `i` is 2, 5 is not divisible by 2.
   - When `i` is 3, 5 is not divisible by 3.
   - When `i` is 4, 5 is not divisible by 4.
6. Since the loop completes without returning `False`, the code execution proceeds to the line after the loop and returns `True`.
