<<<Analysis>>>
1. **Initialization:**
   - The function `is_sorted` takes a list `lst` as input, which is `[5]` in this case.
   - It creates a dictionary `count_digit` to store the frequency of each element in the list. Initially, it's ` {5: 0}`.
   - Then it iterates through the list and increments the count for element '5', making  `count_digit` to `{5: 1}`.

2. **Checking for more than two occurrences:**
   - It checks if any element in the list appears more than twice. Since '5' appears only once, this condition is False.

3. **Checking for Sorted order:**
   - It then enters another conditional statement to check if the list is sorted in non-decreasing order. 
   - Since the list has only one element, the loop inside the `all` condition never runs. The `all` function returns `True` when given an empty iterable.

4. **Returning the Result:**
   - Therefore, the function returns `True`.
