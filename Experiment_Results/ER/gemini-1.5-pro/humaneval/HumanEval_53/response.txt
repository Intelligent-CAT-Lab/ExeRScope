<<<Analysis>>>
The function `add` takes two arguments, `x` and `y`, both annotated as integers.
In this specific call `add(0, 1)`, `x` takes the value 0 and `y` takes the value 1.
The function then calculates the sum of `x` and `y`, which is 0 + 1 = 1.
Finally, the function returns the result of the addition.
