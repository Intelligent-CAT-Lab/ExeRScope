<<<Analysis>>>
The function `words_in_sentence` takes a string `sentence` as input, splits it into individual words, and then processes each word to determine if it should be included in the output.

1. **Initialization:**
   - `new_lst`: An empty list to store the words that meet the criteria.

2. **Iterating through words:**
   - The code iterates through each word in the input sentence using `sentence.split()`.

3. **Checking word length and divisibility:**
   - For each word:
     - `flg = 0`: A flag is initially set to 0, assuming the word might meet the criteria.
     - If the word's length is 1, `flg` is set to 1 (meaning it doesn't meet the criteria).
     - The code then iterates from 2 up to the length of the word, checking if the word's length is divisible by any number in this range. If it finds a divisor, `flg` is set to 1.

4. **Appending to the list:**
   - After checking divisibility:
     - If `flg` is still 0 (meaning the word's length is either 2 or not divisible by any number from 2 to its length - 1), the word is appended to `new_lst`.

5. **Joining and returning:**
   - Finally, the words in `new_lst` are joined back into a string with spaces in between, and this string is returned as the result.

When the input is "This is a test", the code will go through the following:

- "This": Length is 4. Divisible by 2. Not added to `new_lst`.
- "is": Length is 2. Added to `new_lst`.
- "a": Length is 1. Not added to `new_lst`.
- "test": Length is 4. Divisible by 2. Not added to `new_lst`.

Therefore, only the word "is" will be included in the final output.
