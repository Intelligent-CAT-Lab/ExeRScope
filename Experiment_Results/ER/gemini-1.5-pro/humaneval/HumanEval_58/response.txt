<<<Analysis>>>
The function `common` takes two lists `l1` and `l2` as input. 
It initializes an empty set `ret` which will be used to store the common elements.
Then it iterates through each element `e1` in `l1` and for each `e1`, it iterates through each element `e2` in `l2`.
If `e1` is equal to `e2`, it means that the element is common to both lists, so it is added to the set `ret`. Since sets cannot contain duplicate values, each common element will be added only once.
After comparing all the possible pairs, `ret` will contain all the common elements. Finally, the code converts the set `ret` to a list using  `list(ret)`, sorts this list and then returns the sorted list.  
For the input `[1, 4, 3, 34, 653, 2, 5]` and `[5, 7, 1, 5, 9, 653, 121]`, the common elements are 1, 5 and 653. So the function will return a sorted list containing these elements.
<<<Output>>>
[1, 5, 653]
