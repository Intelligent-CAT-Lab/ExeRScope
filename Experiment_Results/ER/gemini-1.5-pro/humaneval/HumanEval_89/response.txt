The function `encrypt` takes a string `s` as input. In this case, `s` is "hi".
- A string `d` containing all lowercase letters of the English alphabet is initialized. This will be used as a reference to encrypt the input string. 
- An empty string `out` is initialized, which will store the encrypted output.
- The code then iterates through each character `c` in the input string "hi".
    - For the first character 'h':
        - It checks if 'h' is in `d` (alphabet). Since it is, it calculates the new index as  `(index of 'h' in `d` + 2*2) % 26`. This results in (7 + 4) % 26 = 11.
        - The character at index 11 in `d` is 'l', which is appended to `out`.
    - For the second character 'i':
        - The same process is repeated:  `(index of 'i' in `d` + 2*2) % 26` which results in (8 + 4) % 26 = 12.
        - The character at index 12 in `d` is 'm', which is appended to `out`.
- Finally, the function returns the `out` string.
