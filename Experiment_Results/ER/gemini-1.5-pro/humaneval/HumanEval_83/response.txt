<<<Analysis>>>
The function `starts_one_ends(n)` calculates the number of integers with `n` digits that start with '1' and end with an even digit. 

1. **Input:** The function receives `n = 1` as input.
2. **Base Case:** It first checks if `n == 1`. Since this is true, it directly returns `1`. This is because there's only one single-digit number that starts with '1' and ends with an even digit, which is '1' itself.

Therefore, the function doesn't execute the second return statement and returns 1.

<<<Output>>>
1
