<<<Analysis>>>
The function `filter_integers` takes a list `values` as input. It then uses a list comprehension to iterate through each element `x` in the input list. For each element, it checks if `isinstance(x, int)` is True. This condition checks whether the element `x` is an instance of the `int` class, which means it checks if `x` is an integer. If the condition is True, the element `x` is included in the new list being constructed. This process effectively filters out any elements from the input list that are not integers, resulting in a new list containing only the integer elements. When applied to the input list `[3, 'c', 3, 3, 'a', 'b']`, the list comprehension will only include the elements 3, 3, and 3. 

<<<Output>>>
[3, 3, 3]
