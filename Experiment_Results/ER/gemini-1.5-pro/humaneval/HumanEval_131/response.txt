<<<Analysis>>>
The function digits takes an integer n as input, in this case, n = 5.
Inside the function:
- `product` is initialized to 1. This variable will store the product of odd digits.
- `odd_count` is initialized to 0. This variable will count the number of odd digits.
The code then iterates through each digit in the string representation of '5'.
- Since there's only one digit '5':
    -  `int_digit` becomes 5.
    -  The code checks if it's odd (5 % 2 == 1).
    -  Since 5 is odd:
        - `product` is updated to 1 * 5 = 5.
        - `odd_count` is incremented to 1.
- After processing all digits, the code checks if `odd_count` is 0.
- Since `odd_count` is 1, the function returns the value of `product`, which is 5.
<<<Output>>>
5
