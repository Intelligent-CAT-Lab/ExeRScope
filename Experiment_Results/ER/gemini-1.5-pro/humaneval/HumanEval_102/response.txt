<<<Analysis>>>
The function `choose_num(x, y)` takes two integers `x` and `y` as input.

1. **First Condition:** `if x > y:` 
   - In this case, `x` is 12 and `y` is 15. The condition `12 > 15` is **False**. So, the code does not return -1 and moves to the next condition.

2. **Second Condition:** `if y % 2 == 0:`
   - This condition checks if `y` (which is 15) is even. Since 15 is not divisible by 2, the condition is **False**. The code proceeds to the next condition.

3. **Third Condition:** `if x == y:`
   - This condition checks if `x` (12) is equal to `y` (15). This condition is also **False** as they are not equal. The code moves to the next line.

4. **Final Return:** `return y - 1`
   - Since none of the previous conditions were met, the code executes this line. It calculates `y - 1` which is `15 - 1 = 14` and returns this value.
