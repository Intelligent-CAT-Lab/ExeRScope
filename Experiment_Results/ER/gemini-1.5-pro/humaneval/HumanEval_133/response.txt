<<<Analysis>>>
The function `sum_squares` takes a list `lst` as input, which in this case is `[1, 2, 3]`.
- It initializes a variable `squared` to 0. This variable will store the sum of squares.
- The code then enters a for loop that iterates through each element `i` in the list `lst`.
- For each element `i`, it calculates the ceiling of `i` using `math.ceil(i)`, squares the result, and adds it to the `squared` variable. 
    - When `i` is 1, `math.ceil(1)` = 1, and 1 squared is 1. This is added to `squared`, making it 1.
    - When `i` is 2, `math.ceil(2)` = 2, and 2 squared is 4. This is added to `squared`, making it 5.
    - When `i` is 3, `math.ceil(3)` = 3, and 3 squared is 9. This is added to `squared`, making it 14.
- After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `squared`.
