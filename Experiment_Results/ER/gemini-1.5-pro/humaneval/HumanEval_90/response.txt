<<<Analysis>>>
1. **Function Call and Input:** The code defines a function `next_smallest(lst)` which takes a list `lst` as input. In this case, the input is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.

2. **Sorting and Removing Duplicates:** Inside the function:
    - `set(lst)` converts the input list into a set, which automatically removes any duplicate elements and stores them in an unordered manner. 
    - `sorted(...)` then sorts the elements of the set in ascending order, resulting in a sorted list with no duplicates. For the given input, this would result in the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.

3. **Finding the Second Smallest:**
    - `len(lst)` checks the length of the sorted list.
    - If the length is less than 2 (meaning there's only one or zero elements), it means there's no "next smallest" element, so the function returns `None`.
    - Otherwise, `lst[1]` accesses and returns the second element of the sorted list (index 1, as Python uses zero-based indexing), which represents the next smallest element after the first one.

4. **Returning the Result:** For the input `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the function will return the value `2` as it is the second smallest element in the sorted list.
