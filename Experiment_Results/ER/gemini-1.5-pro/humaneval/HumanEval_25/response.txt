<<<Analysis>>>
1. The function `factorize` takes an integer `n` as input, in this case, `n` is 2.
2. It initializes an empty list called `fact` to store the factors.
3. It then enters a `while` loop that continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `n` plus 1 (which is 2 in this case).
4. Inside the loop, it checks if `n` is divisible by `i` without any remainder. 
5. Since 2 is divisible by 2, it appends 2 to the `fact` list and divides `n` by 2.
6. Now `n` becomes 1 and it fails the while loop condition.
7. As `n` is not greater than 1, the code does not enter the if condition.
8. Finally the code will return the `fact` list.
