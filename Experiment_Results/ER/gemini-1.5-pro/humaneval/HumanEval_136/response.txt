1. The function `largest_smallest_integers` takes a list `lst` as input. In this case, `lst` is `[2, 4, 1, 3, 5, 7]`.
2. Inside the function, it first uses `filter` and `lambda` to create a new list called `smallest` which contains all the negative numbers from `lst`. In this case, there are no negative numbers, so `smallest` will be an empty list `[]`.
3. Similarly, it creates another list called `largest` using `filter` and `lambda` to store all the positive numbers from `lst`. Here, `largest` will be `[2, 4, 1, 3, 5, 7]` (which is the same as the input list since all numbers are positive).
4. Next, the code uses a conditional expression to check if `smallest` is empty or not. If it's not empty, it means there were negative numbers in the input, and it calls `max(smallest)` to find the largest among them. However, in this case, `smallest` is empty, so it will return `None`.
5. Similarly, it checks if `largest` is empty. Since `largest` is not empty, it calls `min(largest)` to find the smallest positive number in the list, which is `1`.
6. Finally, the function returns a tuple containing the results from steps 4 and 5.
