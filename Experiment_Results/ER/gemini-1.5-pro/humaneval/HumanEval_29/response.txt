<<<Analysis>>>
The function `filter_by_prefix` takes two arguments: a list of strings called `strings` and a string called `prefix`. The function is expected to return a new list containing only the strings from the input list that start with the given `prefix`.

In this specific case, the input list `strings` is an empty list (`[]`), and the `prefix` is the string `"john"`. 

Let's break down the code: 

1. **`[x for x in strings if x.startswith(prefix)]`**: This is a list comprehension. It iterates through each element `x` in the `strings` list. 
2. **`if x.startswith(prefix)`**: For each `x`, it checks if it starts with the `prefix` "john". 
3. If the condition is true, the element `x` is included in the new list that is being constructed. 

Since the input list `strings` is empty, the loop will not run, and no strings will be added to the new list. 

Therefore, the function will return an empty list.
