<<<Analysis>>>
The function `multiply` takes two arguments, `a` and `b`. 
1. It first calculates `a % 10` which gives the remainder when `a` is divided by 10. In this case, `148 % 10` equals to 8.
2. It then calculates `b % 10` which provides the remainder when `b` is divided by 10. Here, `412 % 10` results in 2.
3. Next, it computes the absolute values of both results from step 1 and 2 using `abs()` function. Since both 8 and 2 are positive numbers, their absolute values remain the same.
4. Finally, it multiplies the absolute values obtained in the previous step, which is `8 * 2`, resulting in 16.

Therefore, the function will return the value 16.
