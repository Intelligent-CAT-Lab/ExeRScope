1. The function `pluck` takes a list `arr` as input. In this case, `arr` is `[4, 2, 3]`.
2. It first checks if `arr` is empty. If it is, it returns an empty list `[]`. In this case, `arr` is not empty, so the code proceeds.
3. It then creates a new list `evens` containing all even numbers from `arr`. This is done using a lambda function and the `filter` method. The lambda function `lambda x: x % 2 == 0` checks if a number `x` is even. The `filter` method applies this lambda function to each element of `arr` and returns an iterable containing only the even numbers. The `list()` constructor then converts this iterable into a list. In this case, `evens` will be `[4, 2]`.
4. It then checks if the list `evens` is empty. If it is, it returns an empty list `[]`. In this case, `evens` is not empty, so the code proceeds.
5. It then calculates the minimum value in `evens` using the `min()` function. In this case, the minimum value is `2`.
6. It then finds the index of the minimum value in the original list `arr` using the `index()` method. In this case, the index of `2` in `arr` is `1`.
7. Finally, it returns a new list containing the minimum even value and its index in `arr`, which is `[2, 1]`.
