<<<Analysis>>>
1. **Function Definition:** The code defines a function `add(lst)` that takes a list `lst` as input.
2. **List Comprehension:** Inside the function, it uses a list comprehension `[lst[i] for i in range(1, len(lst), 2) if lst[i]%2 == 0]` to process the input list. Let's break down the list comprehension:
   - `range(1, len(lst), 2)`: This generates a sequence of indices starting from index 1 (the second element), incrementing by 2 for each step. In this specific case, since the length of the list is 2, this range will only produce the value 1.
   - `lst[i]` : This extracts the element at the current index `i` from the list `lst`. 
   - `if lst[i]%2 == 0`: This condition checks if the element at the current index `i` is even. If it is, the element is included in the new list created by the list comprehension. 
3. **Summation:** The `sum()` function is then used to calculate the sum of the elements in the list created by the list comprehension. In this case, the list comprehension will result in a list containing only the element 88. The `sum()` function will then return 88.
