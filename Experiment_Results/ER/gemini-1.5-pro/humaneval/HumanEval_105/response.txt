<<<Analysis>>>
1. The function `by_length` takes a list of integers `arr` as input. Inside the function, a dictionary `dic` is defined to map integers (1 to 9) to their corresponding English word. 
2. The input list `arr` is sorted in reverse order using `sorted(arr, reverse=True)` and stored in `sorted_arr`, resulting in `[8, 5, 4, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1]`.
3. An empty list `new_arr` is created to store the result. 
4. The code then iterates through each element `var` in the `sorted_arr`. For each element, it attempts to append the corresponding English word from the dictionary `dic` to `new_arr`. 
5. If the element `var` is not a key in the dictionary (i.e., not in the range 1-9), a `KeyError` would occur, but the `try-except` block catches this error and silently passes, doing nothing. 
6. Finally, the `new_arr` is returned. In this case, the returned list will contain the English words corresponding to each integer in the sorted input list.

<<<Output>>>
['Eight', 'Five', 'Four', 'Three', 'Two', 'Two', 'One', 'One']
