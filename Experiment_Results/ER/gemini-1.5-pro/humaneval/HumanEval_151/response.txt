<<<Analysis>>>
The function `double_the_difference` takes a list `lst` as input.
It uses a list comprehension to iterate through each element `i` in the list. 
For each element, it checks  if it is positive (`i > 0`), odd (`i % 2 != 0`), and an integer (`"." not in str(i)`). 
If all conditions are true, it squares the element (`i**2`) and includes it in a new list.
Finally, it calculates the sum of the elements in the new list and returns the value. 
In this specific case, only the number 3 in the input list satisfies all the conditions. So, it calculates 3**2 which is equal to 9.
<<<Output>>>
9
