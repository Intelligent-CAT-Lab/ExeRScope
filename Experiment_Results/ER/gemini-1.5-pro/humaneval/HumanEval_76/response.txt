<<<Analysis>>>
The function `is_simple_power(x, n)` aims to determine if `x` can be perfectly represented as `n` raised to some power. In this specific case, we're checking if 16 is a power of 2.

1. **Initialization:**
   - `x` is set to 16.
   - `n` is set to 2.

2. **Base Case Check (n == 1):**
   - The code first checks if `n` is 1. Since `n` is 2, this condition is false, and the execution proceeds.

3. **Iterative Power Calculation:**
   - `power` is initialized to 1.
   - The `while (power < x)` loop starts. This loop repeatedly multiplies `power` by `n` until `power` becomes equal to or greater than `x`.
     - **Iteration 1:** `power` (1) * `n` (2) = 2. `power` is now 2.
     - **Iteration 2:** `power` (2) * `n` (2) = 4. `power` is now 4.
     - **Iteration 3:** `power` (4) * `n` (2) = 8. `power` is now 8.
     - **Iteration 4:** `power` (8) * `n` (2) = 16. `power` is now 16.

4. **Final Comparison:**
   - The loop exits since `power` (16) is now equal to `x` (16). 
   - The code returns `True` because `power == x`.
