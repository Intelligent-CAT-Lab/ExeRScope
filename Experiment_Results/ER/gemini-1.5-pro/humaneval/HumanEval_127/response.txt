<<<Analysis>>>
The function `intersection` takes two tuples as input, `interval1` and `interval2`, representing two intervals. 
1. It first determines the maximum of the starting points of both intervals using `l = max(interval1[0], interval2[0])`, which is `max(1, 2) = 2` in this case.
2. It then determines the minimum of the ending points of both intervals using `r = min(interval1[1], interval2[1])`, which is `min(2, 3) = 2`.
3. The length of the intersection is calculated as `length = r - l`, which is `2 - 2 = 0`.
4. Since the length is not greater than 0, the condition `length > 0 and is_prime(length)` in the `if` statement evaluates to `False`.
5. Therefore, the function returns "NO".
