<<<Analysis>>>
The function initializes a variable called `depth` to 0. This variable will keep track of the current nesting depth of the brackets.
The code then iterates through each character in the input string `"<<><>>"`.
For each character 'b':
    - If 'b' is an opening bracket "<", it increments the 'depth' by 1, indicating a deeper nesting level.
    - If 'b' is a closing bracket ">", it decrements the 'depth' by 1, indicating a reduction in nesting level.
    - After processing each bracket, the code checks if 'depth' has become negative. A negative 'depth' means there's an imbalance - a closing bracket appeared without a corresponding opening bracket. In such a case, the function immediately returns 'False'.
If the loop completes without encountering an invalid state (negative depth), the function finally checks if 'depth' is exactly 0. This ensures that all opening brackets have been properly closed. If 'depth' is 0, it means the bracketing is correct, and the function returns 'True'; otherwise, it returns 'False'.
For the specific input "<<><>>", the depth would evolve as follows:
1. `depth = 0`
2. `<`: `depth = 1`
3. `<`: `depth = 2` 
4. `>`: `depth = 1`
5. `<`: `depth = 2`
6. `>`: `depth = 1`
7. `>`: `depth = 0`
Since `depth` is 0 at the end and never goes negative, the function returns True.

<<<Output>>>
True
