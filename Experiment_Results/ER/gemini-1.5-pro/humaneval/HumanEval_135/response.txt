1. The function `can_arrange` takes a list `arr` as input. In this case, `arr` is `[1, 2, 4, 3, 5]`.
2. Inside the function:
   - `ind` is initialized to `-1`. This variable will be used to store the index where the decreasing order is found.
   - `i` is initialized to `1`. This variable will be used as a loop counter.
3. The `while` loop starts and continues as long as `i` is less than the length of `arr` (which is 5 in this case).
4. In the first iteration of the loop:
   - `i` is `1`.
   - The code checks if `arr[1]` (which is `2`) is less than `arr[0]` (which is `1`). This condition is False.
   - `i` is incremented to `2`.
5. In the second iteration of the loop:
   - `i` is `2`.
   - The code checks if `arr[2]` (which is `4`) is less than `arr[1]` (which is `2`). This condition is False.
   - `i` is incremented to `3`.
6. In the third iteration of the loop:
   - `i` is `3`.
   - The code checks if `arr[3]` (which is `3`) is less than `arr[2]` (which is `4`). This condition is True.
   - `ind` is updated to `3` (the current value of `i`).
   - `i` is incremented to `4`.
7. The loop continues, but the condition `arr[i] < arr[i-1]` is never True again.
8. When `i` becomes `5`, the loop condition `i < len(arr)` becomes False, and the loop ends.
9. Finally, the function returns the value of `ind`, which is `3`.
