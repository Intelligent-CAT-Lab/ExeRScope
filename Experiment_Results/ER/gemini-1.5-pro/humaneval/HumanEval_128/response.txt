<<<Analysis>>>
1. **Initialization:**
   - The function `prod_signs` takes a list `arr` as input, in this case, `[1, 2, 2, -4]`.

2. **Empty List Check:**
   - It first checks if the list is empty using `if not arr`. Since the list is not empty, it proceeds.

3. **Calculating `prod`:**
   - It checks if `0` is present in the list. If present, it sets `prod` to `0`.  In this case, `0` is not present.
   - It then counts the number of negative numbers in the list using `len(list(filter(lambda x: x < 0, arr)))`. Here, there's one negative number (-4).
   - Since there's one negative number, `prod` is calculated as `(-1) ** 1`, which results in `-1`.

4. **Calculating Sum of Absolute Values:**
   - It calculates the sum of the absolute values of elements in the list: `sum([abs(i) for i in arr])`. This evaluates to `1 + 2 + 2 + 4 = 9`.

5. **Returning the Result:**
   - Finally, it multiplies `prod` (-1) with the sum of absolute values (9) and returns the result: `-1 * 9 = -9`.

<<<Output>>>
-9
