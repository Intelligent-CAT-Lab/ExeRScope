<<<Analysis>>>
1. The function `tri(n)` takes an integer `n` as input, which determines the length of the output list.
2. It first checks if `n` is equal to 0. If it is, it returns a list containing only the element `1`.
3. If `n` is not 0, it initializes a list `my_tri` with the elements `[1, 3]`.
4. Then, it enters a loop that iterates from `i = 2` to `n + 1` (exclusive), meaning the loop will run for `i = 2` and `i = 3` when `n = 3`.
5. In each iteration of the loop, it checks if `i` is even. 
    - If `i` is even, it appends the value `i / 2 + 1` to the list `my_tri`.
    - If `i` is odd, it calculates the sum of the last two elements of `my_tri`, adds `(i + 3) / 2` to it, and appends the result to `my_tri`.
6. When `i = 2`, the code enters the even branch and calculates `2/2 + 1 = 2` and appends it to the list. 
7. When `i = 3`, the code enters the odd branch. It calculates `my_tri[2] + my_tri[1] + (3 + 3) / 2 = 2 + 3 + 3 = 8` and appends it to the list.
8. After the loop completes, the function returns the list `my_tri`.
Therefore, when the input is 3, the function will return the list `[1, 3, 2, 8]`.
