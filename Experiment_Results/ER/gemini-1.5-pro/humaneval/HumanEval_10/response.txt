<<<Analysis>>>
The function `is_palindrome` aims to find the shortest palindrome that can be formed by adding characters to the end of the input string. It does this by recursively checking substrings from the input and appending their reverse until a palindrome is formed.

1. **Initial Call:** `is_palindrome('jerry')`:
   - `string` is "jerry".
   - The string is not empty, so it continues.
   - `beginning_of_suffix` is initialized to 0.

2. **Recursive Call 1:** `is_palindrome('jerry')`:
   - It checks if "jerry" is a palindrome (it's not).
   - `beginning_of_suffix` is incremented to 1.

3. **Recursive Call 2:** `is_palindrome('erry')`:
   - It checks if "erry" is a palindrome (it's not).
   - `beginning_of_suffix` is incremented to 2.

4. **Recursive Call 3:** `is_palindrome('rry')`:
   - It checks if "rry" is a palindrome (it's not).
   - `beginning_of_suffix` is incremented to 3.

5. **Recursive Call 4:** `is_palindrome('ry')`:
   - It checks if "ry" is a palindrome (it's not).
   - `beginning_of_suffix` is incremented to 4.

6. **Recursive Call 5:** `is_palindrome('y')`:
   - It checks if "y" is a palindrome (it is!).
   - The base case `if not string` is triggered since the `beginning_of_suffix` is equal to the length of the string, resulting in an empty string being passed in.
   - This returns an empty string `''`.

7. **Unwinding Recursion:**
   - **Recursive Call 4:** Receives `''` from the previous call. It appends `'y'` (reversed substring) to `''`, resulting in `'y'`.
   - **Recursive Call 3:** Receives `'y'` and appends `'yr'` (reversed substring), resulting in `'yry'`.
   - **Recursive Call 2:** Receives `'yry'` and appends `'yr'` (reversed substring), resulting in `'yryyr'`.
   - **Recursive Call 1:** Receives `'yryyr'` and appends `'er'` (reversed substring), resulting in `'yryyrer'`.
   - **Initial Call:** Receives `'yryyrer'` and appends `'jerr'` (reversed substring), resulting in `'yryyrerjerr'`.

8. **Final Return:** The function returns `'yryyrerjerr'`.
