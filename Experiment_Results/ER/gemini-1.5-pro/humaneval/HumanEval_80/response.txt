<<<Analysis>>>
The function `is_happy` checks if a string has three consecutive characters that are all different.  Here's how it processes the input "a":

1. **Length Check:** It starts by checking if the length of the string "a" is less than 3. Since the length of "a" is 1, which is less than 3, the condition `len(s) < 3` evaluates to `True`.

2. **Return False:**  Because the length condition is met, the function immediately returns `False`. It doesn't even enter the loop.

<<<Output>>>
False
