<<<Analysis>>>
The function `change_base` takes two arguments: an integer `x` and a base `base`. It aims to convert the integer `x` from base 10 to the given `base` and returns the result as a string.

1. **Initialization:**
   - `ret = ""`: An empty string `ret` is initialized, which will be used to store the digits of the converted number.
   - `x = 8`, `base = 3`: The values 8 and 3 are assigned to `x` and `base`, respectively.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The `while x > 0` loop iterates as long as `x` is greater than 0.
     - **Iteration 1:**
       - `x % base = 8 % 3 = 2`: The remainder when 8 is divided by 3 is 2.
       - `ret = "2" + "" = "2"`: The remainder (2) is converted to a string and appended to the beginning of `ret`.
       - `x //= base = 8 // 3 = 2`: `x` is updated to the quotient of the division (2).
     - **Iteration 2:**
       - `x % base = 2 % 3 = 2`: The remainder when 2 is divided by 3 is 2.
       - `ret = "2" + "2" = "22"`: The remainder (2) is converted to a string and appended to the beginning of `ret`.
       - `x //= base = 2 // 3 = 0`:  `x` is updated to the quotient of the division (0).
   - The loop terminates since `x` is now 0.

3. **Return Value:**
   - The function returns the string `ret`, which now holds the value `"22"`.

Therefore, the function calculates that 8 in base 3 is represented as "22".
