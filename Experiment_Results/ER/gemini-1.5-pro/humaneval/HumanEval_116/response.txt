<<<Analysis>>>
The function `sort_array` takes a list of integers `arr` as input.
1. **Inner `sorted(arr)`:** It first sorts the input list `arr` in ascending order. So, `[1, 5, 2, 3, 4]` becomes `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
2. **`key=lambda x: bin(x)[2:].count('1')`:** This part defines a custom sorting key using a lambda function. 
    - For each element `x` in the sorted list, it calculates its binary representation using `bin(x)`. 
    - It removes the leading '0b' from the binary string using `[2:]`.
    - It then counts the number of '1' bits in the binary string.
3. **Outer `sorted(...)`:**  The outer `sorted` function uses this count of '1' bits as the key to sort the already sorted list. Elements with fewer '1' bits in their binary representation will come first.
    - `1` (0b1) has 1 '1' bit.
    - `2` (0b10) has 1 '1' bit.
    - `4` (0b100) has 1 '1' bit.
    - `3` (0b11) has 2 '1' bits.
    - `5` (0b101) has 2 '1' bits.

Therefore, the final sorted order will be based on the number of '1' bits, resulting in `[1, 2, 4, 3, 5]`.
