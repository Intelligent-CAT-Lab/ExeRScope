<<<Analysis>>>
1. The function initializes two variables: `res` (an empty list to store the result) and `switch` (a boolean initially set to True). `switch` will alternate between True and False to determine whether to pick the minimum or maximum value in each iteration. 

2. The `while lst:` loop will continue as long as the input list `lst` is not empty.

   * In the first iteration, `switch` is True, so it appends the minimum value of `lst` (which is 1) to `res`. Then, it removes 1 from `lst`. `switch` is set to False. 
   * In the second iteration, `switch` is False, so it appends the maximum value of the current `lst` (which is 4) to `res`. Then, it removes 4 from `lst`. `switch` is set to True. 
   * In the third iteration, `switch` is True, so it appends the minimum value of the current `lst` (which is 2) to `res`. Then, it removes 2 from `lst`. `switch` is set to False.
   * In the fourth iteration, `switch` is False, so it appends the maximum value of the current `lst` (which is 3) to `res`. Then, it removes 3 from `lst`. `switch` is set to True. Now `lst` is empty and the loop ends.

3. Finally, the function returns the `res` list.
