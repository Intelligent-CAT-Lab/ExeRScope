<<<Analysis>>>
The function `compare` takes two lists, `game` and `guess`, as input. In this case, `game` is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1] and `guess` is [1, 2, 3, 4, 2, -2].

The code then uses a list comprehension to iterate through both lists simultaneously using `zip(game, guess)`. For each pair of corresponding elements `x` from `game` and `y` from `guess`, it calculates the absolute difference `abs(x - y)`.

Finally, the code returns a new list containing these absolute differences.

Here's how the list comprehension processes each pair of elements:

1. `abs(1 - 1) = 0` 
2. `abs(2 - 2) = 0`
3. `abs(3 - 3) = 0`
4. `abs(4 - 4) = 0`
5. `abs(5 - 2) = 3`
6. `abs(1 - (-2)) = 3`

<<<Output>>>
[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3]
