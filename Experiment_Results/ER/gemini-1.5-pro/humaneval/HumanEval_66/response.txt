<<<Analysis>>>
The function `digitSum` takes a string `s` as input. 
1. It first checks if the string is empty. If it is, it returns 0.
2. If the string is not empty, it iterates through each character in the string.
3. For each character, it checks if it is an uppercase letter using `isupper()`.
4. If the character is uppercase, its ASCII value is added to the sum using `ord(char)`. If it is not uppercase, 0 is added.
5. Finally, the function returns the total sum.

For the input "You arE Very Smart", the function will add the ASCII values of 'Y', 'E', 'V' and 'S'.
