<<<Analysis>>>
The function rounded_avg(n, m) first checks if m is less than n. If it is, it returns -1.
In this case, m is 5 and n is 1, so m is not less than n.
The code then initializes a variable called summation to 0.
The code then enters a for loop that iterates from n to m+1. In this case, the loop will iterate from 1 to 6.
For each iteration of the loop, the value of i is added to summation.
After the loop has finished, the code divides summation by (m - n + 1), which in this case is (5 - 1 + 1) = 5. This gives us the average of the numbers from n to m.
The average is then rounded to the nearest integer.
Finally, the rounded average is converted to binary representation using the bin() function. 
Therefore, the output will be the binary representation of the rounded average of numbers from 1 to 5, which is 3.
