<<<Analysis>>>
The function `minSubArraySum` aims to find the minimum sum of a subarray within the input list `nums`. It does this by cleverly leveraging the idea of finding the maximum sum of a subarray after negating all elements. 

1. **Initialization:**
   - `max_sum` is initialized to 0. This variable will keep track of the maximum sum of a subarray encountered (after negation of elements).
   - `s` is initialized to 0. This variable represents the current running sum of the subarray being considered.

2. **Iterating through the Array:**
   - The code loops through each element (`num`) in the input list `nums`.
   - **Negation and Accumulation:** For each `num`, its negated value (`-num`) is added to the current running sum `s`.
   - **Checking for Negative Sum:** If `s` becomes negative, it's reset to 0. This is because a negative running sum would only increase the overall sum if included in the subarray. 
   - **Updating Maximum Sum:**  After each element is processed, `max_sum` is updated to be the maximum value between the current `max_sum` and `s`.

3. **Handling All-Positive Arrays:**
   - After the loop, if `max_sum` is still 0, it indicates that the original array `nums` contained only non-negative numbers (since negation didn't lead to a positive sum). 
   - In this case, the minimum sum subarray would be the smallest element itself. The code finds this by taking the maximum of the negated elements in `nums`.

4. **Returning the Minimum Sum:**
   - Finally, the `min_sum` is calculated by negating `max_sum` and returned as the result.

**Applying the analysis to the input `[2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 4]`: **

The loop will find the maximum subarray sum after negation to be 0 (since there's no way to get a positive sum by adding the negations).  Therefore, it will go into the if condition and calculate `max_sum = max(-2, -3, -4, -1, -2, -4) = -1`. Finally, `min_sum` will be `-(-1) = 1`.
