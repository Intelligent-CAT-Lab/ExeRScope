<<<Analysis>>>
The function `is_multiply_prime` aims to determine if the input `a` (in this case, 5) can be expressed as the product of three prime numbers within the range of 2 to 100.

1. **Outer Loop (i):** It iterates through numbers from 2 to 100, representing the first potential prime factor (i).
   - For each `i`, it checks if `i` is prime using the nested function `is_prime`.
   - If `i` is not prime, the loop continues to the next iteration.

2. **Middle Loop (j):** If `i` is prime, the code enters the second loop, also iterating from 2 to 100, representing the second potential prime factor (j).
   - Similar to the outer loop, it checks if `j` is prime using `is_prime`.
   - If `j` is not prime, the loop continues to the next iteration.

3. **Inner Loop (k):** If both `i` and `j` are prime, the code enters the innermost loop, again iterating from 2 to 100, representing the third potential prime factor (k).
   - It checks if `k` is prime using `is_prime`.
   - If `k` is not prime, the loop continues.

4. **Product Check:** If all three numbers (`i`, `j`, `k`) are prime, the code checks if their product `i * j * k` is equal to the input `a` (which is 5 in this case).
   - **If the product is equal to `a`**, the function immediately returns `True`, indicating that `a` can be expressed as the product of three primes.

5. **Returning False:** If the loops complete without finding any combination of three primes that multiply to `a`, the function returns `False`.

In the specific case of `is_multiply_prime(5)`, the function will return `True` because 5 is itself a prime number, and the code will identify the combination 1 * 1 * 5 (or variations like 1 * 5 * 1) as a valid representation.
