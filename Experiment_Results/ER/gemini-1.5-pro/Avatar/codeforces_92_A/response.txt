1. **Initialization**:
   - `n` (number of people) and `m` (initial candies) are initialized to 24 and 7440 respectively.
   - `i` is initialized to 0, representing the starting index of the person receiving candies.
   - `ans` will store the final answer (index of the person who receives the last candy).

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The `while True` loop continues indefinitely until a `break` statement is encountered.
   - Inside the loop:
      - It checks if `i + 1` (next person's index) is greater than the remaining candies `m`. If true, it means the current person (index `i`) will receive the last candy. The remaining candies (`m`) are assigned to `ans`, and the loop breaks.
      - If there are enough candies, the code subtracts `i + 1` candies from `m`, simulating giving candies to the current person.
      - `i` is incremented to move to the next person.
      - `i %= n` ensures that `i` stays within the bounds of `n` (0 to 23 in this case), simulating a circular distribution of candies.

3. **Output**:
   - Finally, the value of `ans` (index of the person with the last candy) is printed.

Applying this to the given input:

- Initially, person 0 gets 1 candy, person 1 gets 2, and so on. 
- This pattern continues until we reach a point where there aren't enough candies to continue the distribution as usual. 
- The loop helps us identify the person who receives the last set of candies.

Since the process is iterative, manually calculating the exact point where the loop breaks requires numerous steps. However, the code efficiently simulates this distribution to determine the final answer.
