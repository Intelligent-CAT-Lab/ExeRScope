1. The variable `s` is assigned the input string "0000000000".
2. An empty string `my_str` is initialized. This string will be used to store the processed output.
3. The code iterates through each character (c) in the input string `s`.
4. For each character 'c':
   - If 'c' is '0' or '1', it is appended to `my_str`.
   - If 'c' is 'B' and `my_str` is not empty, the last character of `my_str` is removed. 
   - Since the input string only contains '0's, only the first condition is met and all the '0's are appended to `my_str`.
5. Finally,  `my_str`  containing "0000000000" is printed.
