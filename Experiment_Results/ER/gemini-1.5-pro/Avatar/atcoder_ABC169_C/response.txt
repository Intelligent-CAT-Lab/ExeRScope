<<<Analysis>>>
First, the input is split into two strings, '814793613347395' and '1.99', which are assigned to variables a and b, respectively.
Then, b is modified to take the first character ('1') and concatenate it with the substring of b starting from the third character ('.99'), effectively removing the second character ('.').
Next, a and b are converted to integers, resulting in a = 814793613347395 and b = 199.
Finally, the expression a * b // 100 is evaluated. This first performs the multiplication of a and b, and then uses floor division (//) to divide the result by 100, discarding any remainder.
