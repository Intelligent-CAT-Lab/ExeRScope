<<<Analysis>>>
1. **Input:** The code takes the string "5728" as input.
2. **Initialization:** 
    - `st` is initialized as a string containing a single space.
    - The code checks if the length of the input is not equal to 1. It is not, so it proceeds.
3. **First Digit Check:**
    - The code checks if the first digit of the input (`ip[0]`) is '9'. It is not, so it proceeds to the loop.
4. **Looping through Digits:**
    - The code iterates through each digit in the input string "5728".
      - **For digit '5':** Since 5 is greater than 4, it calculates `n = 9 - 5 = 4` and appends '4' to `st`. `st` is now " 4".
      - **For digit '7':** Since 7 is greater than 4, it calculates `n = 9 - 7 = 2` and appends '2' to `st`. `st` is now " 42".
      - **For digit '2':** Since 2 is not greater than 4, it appends '2' to `st`. `st` is now " 422".
      - **For digit '8':** Since 8 is greater than 4, it calculates `n = 9 - 8 = 1` and appends '1' to `st`. `st` is now " 4221".
5. **Final Output:**
    - The loop ends, and the code converts `st` to an integer and prints it.
