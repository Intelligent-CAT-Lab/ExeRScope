1. **Input:** The code takes an integer input, which is  `9552` in this case, and stores it in the variable `N`.
2. **Prime Check Function:** The code defines a function `hoge(n)` to determine if a given number `n` is prime:
   - **Base Case:** If `n` is 2, it's a prime number, so the function returns `True`.
   - **Iteration:** The function iterates from 2 up to the square root of `n` plus 2. For each number `x` in this range:
      - **Divisibility Check:** It checks if `n` is divisible by `x`. If it is, then `n` is not prime, and the function returns `False`.
   - **Prime:** If the loop completes without finding a divisor, `n` is prime, and the function returns `True`.
3. **Finding the Next Prime:** The code enters a `while True` loop, which continues indefinitely until it finds the next prime number.
   - **Check if `N` is Prime:** It calls the `hoge(N)` function to check if the current value of `N` is prime.
   - **Prime Found:** If `hoge(N)` returns `True`, it means `N` is prime. The code then prints the value of `N` and exits the loop (and the program) using `exit()`.
   - **Increment:** If `hoge(N)` returns `False`, the current value of `N` is not prime. The code increments `N` by 1 (`N += 1`) to check the next consecutive number. 

Therefore, the code will start checking from 9552 and keep incrementing it by 1 until it finds the next prime number.

4. **Output:** Based on this logic, the code will output the smallest prime number greater than or equal to 9552. This number is 9553.
