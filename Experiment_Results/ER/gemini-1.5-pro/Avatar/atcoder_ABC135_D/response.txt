<<<Analysis>>>
The code calculates the number of possible strings that can be formed from a given string 's' containing digits and '?' characters, such that the resulting number is divisible by 13.

1. **Initialization:**
   - The input string is taken and converted into a list of strings 's'. The first element of this list is then assigned back to 's', effectively taking only the first string from the input.
   - 'n' stores the length of the string 's'.
   - 'now' is initialized to 1, representing the current power of 10 modulo 13.
   - An empty list 'amari' is created to store the remainders when powers of 10 are divided by 13.

2. **Calculating Remainders:**
   - A loop iterates through the digits of 's'.
   - In each iteration, the current value of 'now' (power of 10 modulo 13) is appended to 'amari'.
   - 'now' is updated by multiplying it by 10 and then taking the modulo 13, preparing for the next power of 10.

3. **Dynamic Programming Initialization:**
   - A 2D list 'ans' is created with dimensions 2x13, initialized with zeroes.
   - The first element of both rows in 'ans' is set to 1, representing the base case where an empty substring is divisible by 13.

4. **Dynamic Programming Iteration:**
   - The code iterates through the digits of 's' in reverse order (from right to left).
   - For each digit 'now':
      - If 'now' is a '?', it means any digit from 0 to 9 can be placed there. The code iterates through all possible digits 'k', calculates the contribution of this digit to the remainder ('plus'), and updates 'ans' based on the previous subproblem results. It utilizes modulo 1000000007 to prevent integer overflows.
      - If 'now' is a digit, it calculates the contribution to the remainder ('plus') and directly updates 'ans' from the previous subproblem result.
   - The 'last' variable keeps track of the row in 'ans' that contains the results for the current subproblem.

5. **Output:**
   - Finally, the code prints the value at 'ans[last][5]', which represents the number of possible strings divisible by 13 with a remainder of 5.
