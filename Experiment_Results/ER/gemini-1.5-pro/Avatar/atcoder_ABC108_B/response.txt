<<<Analysis>>>
First, the variables `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` are assigned values 2, 3, 6, and 6 respectively, from the input.

Then, the code calculates the difference between `x2` and `x1`, which is 4, and assigns it to variable `a`. 

Similarly, the difference between `y2` and `y1` is calculated as 3 and stored in variable `b`.

Finally, the code prints a sequence of calculations:
* `x2 - b`: This calculates 6 - 3, resulting in 3.
* `y2 + a`: This calculates 6 + 4, resulting in 10.
* `x1 - b`: This calculates 2 - 3, resulting in -1.
* `y1 + a`: This calculates 3 + 4, resulting in 7.

Therefore, the output will be the values 3, 10, -1, and 7, separated by spaces.
