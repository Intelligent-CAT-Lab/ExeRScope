<<<Analysis>>>
First, the code initializes three variables `n`, `d`, and `x` by taking input and converting them to Decimal objects for precise calculations.
The code initializes an accumulator variable `ans` to 0, which will store the result of the summation.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to `n` (inclusive), effectively iterating through the numbers 1, 2, 3, ..., `n`.
Inside the loop:
    1. It converts the current loop variable `i` to a Decimal object for accurate calculations.
    2. For each `i`, it calculates the following expression:  
       `(n - i + 1) / i * (d + x * (2n - 1) / 2)`
    3. It adds the result of this expression to the accumulator variable `ans`
Finally, after the loop completes, the code prints the value of `ans`. This value is the result of the summation calculated based on the input values of `n`, `d`, and `x`.
