<<<Analysis>>>
This code calculates the sum of floor(N/i) * (floor(N/i) + 1) * i / 2 for all i from 1 to N, where N is the input integer. Let's break down how it works:

1. **Input:** The code takes an integer input (in this case, 9995083) and assigns it to the variable `n`.

2. **Initialization:** A variable `ans` is initialized to 0. This variable will store the accumulated sum.

3. **Looping through divisors:** The code then enters a `for` loop that iterates from `i = 1` to `n` (inclusive). In each iteration, it calculates the value of `floor(n/i)`, which represents how many times `i` divides into `n`.

4. **Calculating the sum for each divisor:** For each divisor `i`, the code calculates `i * (1 + x) * x // 2`, where `x = floor(n / i)`. This formula represents the sum of an arithmetic series from 1 to `x` multiplied by `i`.  This is because for all numbers from 1 to floor(N/i), their contribution to the final answer will be 'i'. And there will be floor(N/i) such numbers.

5. **Accumulating the sum:** The calculated value for each divisor is added to the variable `ans`.

6. **Output:** Finally, after the loop completes, the code prints the value of `ans`, which represents the final sum.

For the input 9995083, the code will perform these calculations for each `i` from 1 to 9995083 and sum the results.
