<<<Analysis>>>
This code dynamically counts the number of valid strings of length 'n' consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T', where a string is considered valid if it does not contain "AGC" as a substring. It utilizes memoization through a dictionary 'memo' to store and reuse calculated results, thereby optimizing the recursive process.

1. **Initialization:**
   - 'n' is initialized to 99 (input).
   - 'mod' is set to 10^9 + 7, a prime number used for modulo operation to prevent integer overflow in calculations.
   - 'memo' is initialized as a list of dictionaries, one for each position from 0 to 'n', to store calculated results for different states.

2. **Function `ok(last4)`:**
   - This function checks if a string of length 4 (last4) is valid.
   - It generates all possible permutations of swapping adjacent characters in 'last4'.
   - For each permutation, it checks if "AGC" exists. If found, it's an invalid string, and the function returns 'False'.
   - If no permutation contains "AGC", the function returns 'True'.

3. **Function `dfs(cur, last3)`:**
   - This recursive function does the core calculation of counting valid strings.
   - `cur` indicates the current position being filled in the string (from 0 to 'n').
   - `last3` stores the last three characters considered for the current position.
   - **Base Case:** If 'cur' reaches 'n', it means a valid string of length 'n' is constructed, so it returns 1.
   - **Memoization:** It checks if the result for the current state (`cur`, `last3`) is already calculated and stored in 'memo'. If yes, it returns the stored value, avoiding redundant calculations.
   - **Iteration:**  It iterates through each character ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T').
      - It constructs a potential string by appending the current character to 'last3'.
      - It calls 'ok' function to validate the potential string.
      - If valid, it recursively calls 'dfs' for the next position (`cur` + 1) and updates the count 'ret' using the modulo operator to prevent overflow.
   - **Store and Return:** It stores the calculated count 'ret' in 'memo' for the current state (`cur`, `last3`) and returns 'ret'.

4. **Final Calculation and Output:**
   - It calls the 'dfs' function with initial values `cur` = 0 and `last3` = "TTT" (assuming an empty string initially) to start the calculation.
   - The final count of valid strings is printed.

In essence, the code performs a depth-first search (DFS) through all possible strings, validating each substring of length 4 and employing memoization to optimize the process.
