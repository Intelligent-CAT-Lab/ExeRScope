1. **Input and Initialization:**
   - The input "87 34" is read and split into two integers, `n` (87) and `m` (34).
   - `q` is calculated as the quotient of `n` divided by `m`, which is 87 // 34 = 2.
   - `r` is calculated as the remainder of `n` divided by `m`, which is 87 % 34 = 19.
   - A list `a` is created, initially filled with `m` (34) elements, each having the value of `q` (2): [2, 2, 2, ..., 2].

2. **Distribution of Remainder:**
   - The code then enters a loop that iterates `r` (19) times.
   - In each iteration, it increments the value of the i-th element of list `a` by 1. This effectively distributes the remainder `r` among the first `r` elements of the list.

3. **Output:**
   - Finally, the code iterates through the list `a` and prints each element separated by a space.

Therefore, the list `a` after modification will be: [3, 3, 3, ..., 3, 2, 2, 2, ..., 2], where the first 19 elements are 3 and the rest are 2.
