1. The code imports the `math` module, providing access to mathematical functions like `ceil`.
2. `h` and `a` are assigned values 10000 and 1 respectively, obtained from the input. 
3. The expression `h / a` calculates the division of `h` by `a`. In this case, 10000 / 1 = 10000.
4. `math.ceil(10000)` returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to 10000, which is still 10000. 
5. Finally, the code prints the result, which is 10000.
