<<<Analysis>>>
1. **Initialization:**
   - The code imports the `sys` module for exiting the program later if needed.
   - It imports the `defaultdict` class from the `collections` module, although this import is not used in the code and seems unnecessary.
   - The variable `K` is initialized to the integer value entered by the user, which is 260522 in this case.
   - Variables `cnt` and `now` are initialized to 0. They will track the number of iterations and the current remainder modulo `K` respectively.
2. **Check for Even Input:**
   - The code checks if `K` is divisible by 2 using the modulo operator (`%`). 
   - If `K` is even, the code prints "-1" and exits the program using `sys.exit(0)`. This is because a number consisting only of the digit '7' will always be odd, and thus can never be divisible by an even number.
3. **Iterative Calculation:**
   - The code enters a `for` loop that iterates from 0 to 10^6 (1 million times).
   - In each iteration:
     - The loop counter `cnt` is incremented by 1.
     - The `now` variable is updated. It appends a '7' to the right side of the current number represented by `now` (equivalent to multiplying by 10 and adding 7) and then calculates the remainder after dividing by `K`. This simulates building up a number consisting only of '7's and checking its divisibility by `K`.
     - It then checks if `now` is equal to 0. If true, it means a number consisting of `cnt` number of '7's is divisible by `K`. In this case, the code prints `cnt` (the number of digits '7') and exits the program.
4. **Output -1:**
   - If the loop completes without finding a divisible number within 1 million iterations, the code will print "-1". This signifies that no solution was found within the search space.

**Specific to the input 260522:**

-  Since 260522 is even, the code will immediately identify this in the "Check for Even Input" step.
