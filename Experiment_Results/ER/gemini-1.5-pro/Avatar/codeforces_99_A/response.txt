<<<Analysis>>>
1. **Input and Splitting:**
   - The code takes input as a string, likely representing a decimal number, using `input()`.
   - The input string is split at the "." character using `split('.')`, separating the integer and decimal parts. The result is stored as a list in the variable `num`. For the input "8.3", `num` would be `['8', '3']`.

2. **Checking the Last Digit of the Integer Part:**
   - The code then checks if the last digit of the integer part (`num[0][-1]`) is equal to '9'.
   - In this case, the last digit of '8' is not '9'.

3. **Checking the First Digit of the Decimal Part:**
   - Since the last digit of the integer part is not '9', the code moves to the `else` block.
   - It then checks if the first digit of the decimal part (`num[1][0]`) is greater than or equal to '5'. 
   - In this case, the first digit of the decimal part is '3', which is not greater than or equal to '5'.

4. **Printing the Integer Part:**
   - As the first digit of the decimal part is not greater than or equal to '5', the code prints the integer part of the input number, which is `num[0]`.
