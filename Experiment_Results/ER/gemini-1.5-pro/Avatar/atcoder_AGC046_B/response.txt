<<<Analysis>>>
This code calculates the number of ways to reach point (C, D) on a grid starting from point (A, B), where you can only move one step right or down at a time. The calculation is done modulo m (998244353) to avoid integer overflow for large numbers.

1. **Initialization**:
   -  A, B, C, and D are read from the input and store the starting and ending coordinates respectively (A = 2, B = 1, C = 3, D = 4 in this case). 
   -  m is set to 998244353.
   -  A 2D array 'd' is created with dimensions (C+1) * (D+1), initialized with zeros. This array stores the number of paths to reach a particular point (i, j) in d[i][j]. 
   -  d[A][B] is set to 1, meaning there is one way to reach the starting point (2, 1).

2. **Dynamic Programming**:
   - The code then iterates through the grid using two nested loops, starting from (A, B) to (C, D). 
   - For each point (i, j), the number of ways to reach it is calculated as the sum of the following:
     -  Number of ways to reach (i, j-1) multiplied by i (moving right from the left).
     -  Number of ways to reach (i-1, j) multiplied by j (moving down from above).
     -  Subtract the number of ways to reach (i-1, j-1) multiplied by (i-1)*(j-1). This step accounts for overcounting paths arriving diagonally.
   - Each calculation is done modulo m (998244353).

3. **Output**:
   -  Finally, d[C][D] which represents the number of ways to reach the destination point (3, 4), is printed.
