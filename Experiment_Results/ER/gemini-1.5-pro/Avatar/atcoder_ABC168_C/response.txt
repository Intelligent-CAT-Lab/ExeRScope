<<<Analysis>>>
First, the code imports the math module to use mathematical functions, specifically math.pi, math.cos and math.sin.
The variables `a`, `b`, `h`, and `m` are assigned values 1, 2, 9, and 49, respectively, from the input. These represent the length of the hour hand, the length of the minute hand, the hour, and the minute.
The angle of the hour hand (theta_h) and minute hand (theta_m) with respect to the 12 o'clock position are calculated in radians. The formula takes into account the movement of the hour hand due to the minutes passed.
The x and y coordinates of the tip of the hour hand (x_h, y_h) are calculated using the angle theta_h and the length of the hour hand (a). This utilizes the cosine and sine functions for the x and y coordinates, respectively.
Similarly, the x and y coordinates of the tip of the minute hand (x_m, y_m) are calculated using the angle theta_m and the length of the minute hand (b).
Finally, the distance between the tips of the hour and minute hands is calculated using the distance formula based on the calculated coordinates. The square root of the sum of squared differences is used to find the distance.
The code then prints the calculated distance, which represents the distance between the tips of the hour and minute hands at the given time.
