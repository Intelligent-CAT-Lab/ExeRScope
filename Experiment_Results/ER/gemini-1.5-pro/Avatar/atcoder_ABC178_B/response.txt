<<<Analysis>>>
This code calculates the maximum product possible from multiplying one of the first two numbers with one of the last two. Here's how it works:

1. **Input:** The code takes four integers as input (a, b, c, d), separated by spaces.
2. **Calculate Products:**  The code calculates the products of all possible pairs formed by taking one number from the first two and one from the last two: 
   * a * c
   * a * d
   * b * c
   * b * d
3. **Find Maximum:**  The `max()` function is used to determine the largest value among the calculated products.
4. **Output:** The code prints the maximum product (ans).

In this case, the input numbers are quite large. The maximum product will likely result from multiplying the two negative numbers to get a large positive product.
