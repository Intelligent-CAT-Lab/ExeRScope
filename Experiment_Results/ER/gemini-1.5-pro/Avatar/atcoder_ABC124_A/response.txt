<<<Analysis>>>
First, the variables `a` and `b` will be initialized with the values `6` and `6` respectively from the input.
The variable `c` is initialized to `0`. This variable will store the sum of maximum values in each iteration.
The loop will run twice because of `range(2)`.
**Iteration 1:**
- Since `a` is equal to `b`, `a -= 1` will be executed, making `a = 5` and `b` remains `6`.
- `c` will be updated to `c + max(5, 6)` resulting in `c = 6`.
**Iteration 2:**
- Now, `b` is greater than `a`, so `b -= 1` will be executed making `b = 5` and `a` remains `5`.
- `c` will be updated to `c + max(5, 5)` resulting in `c = 11`.
After the loop ends, the value of `c` which is `11` will be printed.
<<<Output>>>
11
