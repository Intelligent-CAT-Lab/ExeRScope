<<<Analysis>>>
1. The code reads an integer input (512 in this case) and stores it in the variable 'n'.
2. The while loop starts. It checks if 'n' is divisible by 2 (n % 2 == 0). If true, it enters the loop.
3. Inside the loop, 'n' is divided by 2 repeatedly until it's no longer divisible by 2.
    * 512 / 2 = 256
    * 256 / 2 = 128
    * 128 / 2 = 64
    * 64 / 2 = 32
    * 32 / 2 = 16
    * 16 / 2 = 8
    * 8 / 2 = 4
    * 4 / 2 = 2
    * 2 / 2 = 1
4. Now, 'n' becomes 1. The loop condition (n % 2 == 0) becomes false, and the loop ends.
5. The code checks if 'n' is equal to 1. Since 'n' is now 1, it prints 'YES'.

<<<Output>>>
YES
