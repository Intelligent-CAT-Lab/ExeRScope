<<<Analysis>>>
1. **Import calendar module:** This line imports the `calendar` module, which provides functions for working with calendars.
2. **Get input year:** The code reads an integer input from the user and stores it in the variable `y`. In this case,  `y` is 2096.
3. **Check if the input year is a leap year:** The code uses `calendar.isleap(y)` to check if the input year `y` is a leap year.  The result (True or False) is stored in the variable `is_run`. 2096 is a leap year, so `is_run` will be True.
4. **Determine the day of the week for January 1st of the input year:** `calendar.weekday(y, 1, 1)` returns the day of the week for January 1st of the year `y`. 0 represents Monday, 1 represents Tuesday, and so on. The result is stored in the variable `week`. In this case, January 1st, 2096, is a Wednesday, so `week` will be 2. 
5. **Enter a loop:** The code enters a `while True` loop, which will continue indefinitely until a `break` statement is encountered.
6. **Increment the year:** Inside the loop, the value of `y` is incremented by 1 in each iteration. So it starts with 2097.
7. **Check for a year with matching leap year status and starting weekday:** The code checks if the current year `y` satisfies the following two conditions:
    *  It has the same leap year status (`is_run`) as the input year.
    *  January 1st of the current year falls on the same weekday (`week`) as January 1st of the input year.
8. **Print the year and break the loop:** If both conditions are met, the code prints the current year `y` and then breaks out of the loop using `break`. 
9. **Finding the next year:** The loop continues iterating until it finds the next year that is also a leap year and has January 1st on a Wednesday, just like the input year 2096. This year is 2124.
