1. **Initialization:**
   - `n` is assigned the input value, which is 9.
   - `x` is initialized to 1. This variable will track the number of operations performed.

2. **The While Loop:**
   - The loop continues as long as `math.log2(n) % 1` is not zero. This condition checks if `n` is a power of 2. 
     - `math.log2(n)` calculates the base-2 logarithm of `n`. If `n` is a power of 2, the logarithm will be a whole number.
     - `% 1` calculates the remainder when divided by 1. If the logarithm is a whole number, the remainder will be 0, making the condition false and exiting the loop.

3. **Inside the Loop:**
   - **Iteration 1:**
     - `math.log2(9)` is approximately 3.17.
     - `int(math.log2(9))` is 3.
     - `2 ** 3` is 8.
     - `n` is updated to `9 - 8 = 1`.
     - `x` is incremented to `2`.
   - **Iteration 2:**
     - `math.log2(1)` is 0.
     - The loop condition becomes false because `0 % 1` is 0.

4. **Output:**
   - The value of `x`, which is `2`, is printed.
