<<<Analysis>>>
1. **Input:** The code takes two integers as input, separated by a space. In this case, the input is "1 100".
2. **Variable Assignment:**
   -  `S` is assigned the value 1 (the first integer).
   -  `W` is assigned the value 100 (the second integer).
3. **Conditional Statement:** 
   - The code checks if `S` (1) is less than or equal to `W` (100). 
   - Since 1 is less than 100, the condition `S <= W` is **True**.
4. **Output:** As the condition is True, the code prints "unsafe".
