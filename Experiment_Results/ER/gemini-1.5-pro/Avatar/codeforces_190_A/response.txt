<<<Analysis>>>
First, the input values "59 96" are assigned to variables n and m respectively, so n = 59 and m = 96.
The first if-statement checks if n < 1, which is false (59 is not less than 1).
The code then proceeds to the next if-statement, which checks if m > n, which is true (96 is greater than 59). 
Inside this if-block, min is set to m (96), and max is calculated as n + m - 1 (59 + 96 - 1 = 154). 
Finally, the values of min and max are printed: "96 154".
<<<Output>>>
96 154
