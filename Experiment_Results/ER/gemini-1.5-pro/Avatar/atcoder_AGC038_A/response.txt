<<<Analysis>>>
This code takes four numbers as input: H, W, A, and B. It then creates a 2D array (matrix) called 'answer' with H rows and W columns, filled initially with "0"s.

The code then iterates through each cell of this matrix. For each cell at row 'i' and column 'j':

1. It checks if 'i' is less than B.
   a. If true, it further checks if 'j' is less than A.
      - If true, it keeps the cell value as "0".
      - If false, it sets the cell value to "1".
   b. If false, it again checks if 'j' is less than A.
      - If true, it sets the cell value to "1".
      - If false, it keeps the cell value as "0".

Finally, the code prints each row of the 'answer' matrix, effectively creating a pattern of "0"s and "1"s based on the values of A and B.

In the case of input "1000 1000 0 0", both A and B are 0. This means the condition 'i < B' and 'j < A' will always be false. Therefore, the code will set all cells of the matrix to "0".
