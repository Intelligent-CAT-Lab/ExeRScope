1. **Initialization:**
   - `n` is assigned the input value of `99992`.
   - `l` is initialized to `1` (representing the lower bound of the search range).
   - `r` is initialized to `n` (representing the upper bound of the search range).

2. **Binary Search:**
   - The `while (l < r)` loop implements a binary search to find the largest triangular number smaller than or equal to `n`.
   - In each iteration:
     - `mid` is calculated as the middle value between `l` and `r`.
     - `idxcnt` calculates the `mid`-th triangular number using the formula `mid * (mid + 1) / 2`.
     - If `idxcnt` is less than `n`, the search range is narrowed to the right half (`l = mid + 1`).
     - Otherwise, the search range is narrowed to the left half (`r = mid`).

3. **Finding the Difference:**
   - After the loop, `l` will hold the value such that the `l`-th triangular number is the largest one less than or equal to `n`.
   - `l` is decremented by `1` to get the previous triangular number.
   - `idxcnt` is recalculated for the `l`-th triangular number.
   - Finally, the difference between `n` and `idxcnt` is printed, which represents the number of elements needed to reach `n` from the previous triangular number.

**In the specific case of input `99992`:**

- The binary search will converge to `l = 1413`, meaning the `1413`-th triangular number is the largest one smaller than `99992`.
- The code then calculates the difference between `99992` and the `1412`-th triangular number, which is `141`.
