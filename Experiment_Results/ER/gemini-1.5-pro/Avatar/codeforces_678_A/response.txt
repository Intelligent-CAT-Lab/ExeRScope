<<<Analysis>>>
1.  **Input:** The code takes input as a string separated by space, "999999999 1".
2.  **Map:** The `map(int, input().split())` function splits the input string by space, converts each part into an integer, and then assigns those values to `vamshi` and `z`, respectively. So, `vamshi` becomes 999999999 and `z` becomes 1.
3.  **Calculation:**
    *   `vamshi // z` performs integer division, giving us 999999999.
    *   We then add 1 to the result: 999999999 + 1 = 1000000000.
    *   Finally, this result is multiplied by `z` (which is 1): 1000000000 * 1 = 1000000000.
4.  **Output:** The code prints the final result, 1000000000.
