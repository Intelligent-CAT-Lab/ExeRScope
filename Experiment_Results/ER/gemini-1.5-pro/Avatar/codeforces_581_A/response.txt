<<<Analysis>>>
1. **Input and Conversion:**
   -  The code takes input as a string "45 99" using `input()`.
   - `split()` separates the string into a list of strings: `["45", "99"]`.
   - The `for` loop iterates through each element of this list and converts them to integers using `int()`, updating the list to `[45, 99]`.
   - `a` is assigned the value 45 (the first element of the list).
   - `b` is assigned the value 99 (the second element of the list).

2. **Finding Minimum:**
   - `min(x)` finds the minimum value in the list `x` (which is 45) and prints it, followed by a space.

3. **Calculating Difference:**
   - `abs(a - b)` calculates the absolute difference between `a` (45) and `b` (99), resulting in 54. 

4. **Conditional Output:**
   - Since the absolute difference (54) is greater than or equal to 2, the code enters the `if` block.
   - `abs(a - b) // 2` calculates the floor division of the absolute difference by 2 (54 // 2), resulting in 27, which is then printed.
