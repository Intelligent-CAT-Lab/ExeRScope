<<<Analysis>>>
1. **Input:** The code reads in the values "2 1" for N and x respectively.
2. **Conditional Check:** The code checks if x is equal to 1 or 2 * N - 1. In this case, x is 1, so the condition is true.
3. **"No" Output:** Since the condition is true, the code prints "No".
4. **Program Ends:** The code does not execute the 'else' block as the 'if' condition was true.
