1. **Input and Initialization:**
   - The input `4 0 0 4` is read and split into four integers, assigned to variables `anti`, `b`, `c`, and `d` respectively.
   - So, `anti = 4`, `b = 0`, `c = 0`, and `d = 4`.
   - The code calculates `l` as the absolute difference between `anti` and `c`, resulting in `l = 4`.
   - Similarly, `m` is calculated as the absolute difference between `b` and `d`, giving `m = 4`.

2. **Conditional Checks:**
   - The code enters a series of `if-elif-else` conditions to determine the output:
     - **`if anti == c:`:** This condition checks if `anti` is equal to `c`. Since `anti` is 4 and `c` is 0, this condition is false.
     - **`elif b == d:`:** This condition checks if `b` is equal to `d`. This condition is also false as `b` is 0 and `d` is 4.
     - **`elif l != m:`:** This condition checks if `l` is not equal to `m`. Since both `l` and `m` are 4, this condition is false as well.
     - **`else:`:**  As none of the previous conditions were met, the code executes this block, which prints the values of `anti`, `d`, `c`, and `b` separated by spaces.

3. **Output:**
   - Therefore, the output of the code will be: `4 4 0 0`
