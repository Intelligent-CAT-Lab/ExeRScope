<<<Analysis>>>
1.  `a, b = input().split();`: This line takes the input string `35005211 521595368`, splits it into two parts at the space, and assigns them to variables `a` and `b`. So, `a` becomes `35005211` and `b` becomes `521595368`.
2.  `b = int(b[::-1])`: This line does three things:
    *   `b[::-1]`: It reverses the string `b`, so `521595368` becomes `863595125`.
    *   `int(...)`: It converts the reversed string to an integer.
    *   `b = ...`: It assigns the resulting integer back to variable `b`. So now, `b` is `863595125`.
3.  `print(int(a) + b)`: This line does the following:
    *   `int(a)`: It converts string `a` (`35005211`) to an integer.
    *   `... + b`: It adds the integer value of `a` to `b`.
    *   `print(...)`: It prints the final result.
