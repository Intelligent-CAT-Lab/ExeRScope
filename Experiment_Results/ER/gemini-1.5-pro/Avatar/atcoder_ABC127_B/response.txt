<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a simple linear recurrence relation and iterates over it 10 times. Let's break down how it processes the input:

1. **Initialization:**
   -  `r, D, x = map(int, input().split())`: This line reads three space-separated integers from the input and assigns them to variables `r`, `D`, and `x` respectively. Given the input `2 1 2`, we have:
     - `r = 2`
     - `D = 1`
     - `x = 2` 

2. **Iteration:**
   - The code then enters a `for` loop that runs for 10 iterations (`range(10)`).
   - In each iteration:
     - `x = r * x - D`: The value of `x` is updated using the formula `r * x - D`. This is the recurrence relation being implemented.
     - `print(x)`: The updated value of `x` is printed to the console.

Let's execute this step-by-step for the first few iterations:

   - **Iteration 1:**
     - `x = (2 * 2) - 1 = 3`
     - Output: `3`

   - **Iteration 2:**
     - `x = (2 * 3) - 1 = 5`
     - Output: `5`

   - **Iteration 3:**
     - `x = (2 * 5) - 1 = 9`
     - Output: `9`

   ... and so on for the remaining iterations.
