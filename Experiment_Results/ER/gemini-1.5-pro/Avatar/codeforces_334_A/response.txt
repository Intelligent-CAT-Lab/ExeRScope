<<<Analysis>>>
1. The code starts by reading an integer input from the user and storing it in the variable `n`. In this case,  n = 6.
2. It initializes two variables, `i` and `j`. `i` is set to 1, and `j` is set to `n * n`, which is 36.
3. The code then enters a `while` loop that continues as long as the value of `i` is less than the value of `j`.
4. Inside the loop:
    - It prints the current values of `i` and `j` separated by a space.
    - It increments `i` by 1 (`i += 1`).
    - It decrements `j` by 1 (`j -= 1`).
5. This process continues, printing pairs of values, with `i` increasing and `j` decreasing, until `i` is no longer less than `j`.

Therefore, the code will print pairs of numbers, starting from (1, 36), then (2, 35), and so on. This continues until i becomes greater than or equal to j.
