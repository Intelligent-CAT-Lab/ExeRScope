<<<Analysis>>>
1.  **Input:** The code reads an integer input and stores it in the variable `X`. In this case, X = 1.
2.  **Initialization:** 
    *   `i` is initialized to 1. This variable seems to be keeping track of the number of iterations.
    *   `a` is initialized to 0. This variable will be used to accumulate the sum of multiples of X.
3.  **Loop:** The code enters a `while True` loop, which will continue indefinitely until a `break` statement is encountered.
4.  **Inside the Loop:**
    *   `a = a + X`:  In each iteration, the value of `X` is added to `a`. Since X is 1, `a` will take on the values 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on.
    *   `if a % 360 == 0:` This condition checks if `a` is divisible by 360.
        *   If `a` is divisible by 360, it means we've added `X` enough times to get a multiple of 360. In this case, the code will print the current value of `i` (which represents how many times we've added `X`) and then break out of the loop.
        *   If `a` is not divisible by 360, the loop continues.
    *   `i += 1`: If the loop doesn't break, `i` is incremented by 1 before the next iteration.

**In this specific case:**

*   The loop will continue until `a` becomes a multiple of 360.
*   Since `X` is 1, this will happen when `a` reaches 360. 
*   At that point, `i` will be 360, and this value will be printed.
