<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an array as input and aims to generate a sequence of numbers based on specific calculations and conditions. Here's a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `arr` is initialized with the input values: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1].
   - `rem`, `ones` are initialized to 0.
   - `string` is initialized as an empty list, intended to store the generated sequence.

2. **First Loop (Lines 6-9):**
   - `ones` is calculated as the remainder when the last element of `arr` (1) is divided by the second element (1), resulting in `ones` being 0.
   - The loop runs for `arr[1]` (1) iteration.
   - In each iteration:
     - The floor division of the last element of `arr` by the second element (1 / 1 = 1) is calculated.
     - Since `ones` is 0, `(ones > 0)` evaluates to False, effectively adding 0.
     - The result (1) is appended to the `string` list. 

3. **Conditional Block (Lines 10-14):**
   - The condition checks if the first element of `arr` is not equal to the second element (1 != 1). This condition is False, so the code block is skipped.

4. **Second Loop (This loop is skipped):**
   - Since the condition in the previous step was False, this loop is not executed.

5. **Output (Lines 15-16):**
   - The code iterates through the `string` list (which contains only the element '1').
   - For each element, it prints the element followed by a space.
