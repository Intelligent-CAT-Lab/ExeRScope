<<<Analysis>>>
1.  **Input:** The code receives the input "8 8", which is a string containing two numbers separated by a space.
2.  **Split and Convert:** The `input().split()` part takes the input string and splits it into a list of two strings: \["8", "8"\]. The `map(int, ...)` part then converts each string in this list into an integer.
3. **Variable Assignment:** These two integers are assigned to the variables `t` and `h` respectively. So, `t = 8` and `h = 8`.
4.  **Calculation:** The code calculates `(h - 2) // (t - 1) + 1`, which, after substituting the values of `t` and `h`, becomes `(8 - 2) // (8 - 1) + 1`.
5.  **Floor Division:** `//` performs floor division. So, `6 // 7` equals 0.
6.  **Addition:** Finally, `0 + 1` results in `1`.
7. **Print:** The code prints the final result, which is `1`.
