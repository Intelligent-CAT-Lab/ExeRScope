1. **Input and Initialization:**
   - The input "5 5 3 2" is read and split into four integers, assigned to variables `x`, `y`, `a`, and `b` respectively. 
   - So, `x = 5`, `y = 5`, `a = 3`, and `b = 2`.

2. **List Comprehension:**
   - A list comprehension is used to create a list called `c`. This list will store pairs of numbers `[i, j]`.
   - **Outer Loop:** The outer loop iterates through values of `i` from `a` (3) to `x + 1` (6), which means `i` will take values 3, 4, and 5.
   - **Inner Loop:** For each value of `i`, the inner loop iterates through values of `j` from `b` (2) to `y + 1` (6), meaning `j` will take values 2, 3, 4, and 5.
   - **Condition:** The `if i > j` condition ensures that only pairs where `i` is strictly greater than `j` are added to the list `c`.

3. **Output:**
   - `print(len(c))`: This line prints the length of the list `c`, which represents the number of pairs satisfying the condition.
   - `[print(*i) for i in c]`: This list comprehension iterates through each pair `i` in the list `c`. For each pair, it prints the elements of the pair separated by a space.

**Let's break down how the pairs are formed:**

   - When `i = 3`, `j` takes values 2, 3, 4, and 5. Only the pair `[3, 2]` satisfies the condition `i > j`.
   - When `i = 4`, pairs `[4, 2]` and `[4, 3]` satisfy the condition.
   - When `i = 5`, pairs `[5, 2]`, `[5, 3]`, and `[5, 4]` satisfy the condition.

Therefore, the list `c` will be `[[3, 2], [4, 2], [4, 3], [5, 2], [5, 3], [5, 4]]`.
