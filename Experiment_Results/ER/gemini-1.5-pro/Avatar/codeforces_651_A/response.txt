1. **Initialization**:
   - `a1` and `a2` are initialized with the input values 100 and 25, respectively.
   - `t` is initialized to 0, which will track the number of iterations of the loop.
2. **Conditional Check**:
   - The code checks if both `a1` and `a2` are equal to 1. Since this is not the case, it proceeds to the `else` block.
3. **Loop Execution**:
   - The `while` loop continues as long as both `a1` and `a2` are greater than 0.
   - Inside the loop, there's a conditional check:
     - **If `a1` is greater than `a2`**:
       - `a2` is incremented by 1.
       - `a1` is decremented by 2.
     - **Otherwise (if `a2` is greater than or equal to `a1`):**
       - `a2` is decremented by 2.
       - `a1` is incremented by 1.
   - In each iteration, `t` is incremented by 1 to count the steps.
   - The loop continues until either `a1` or `a2` becomes zero or negative. 
4. **Output**:
   - After the loop completes, the value of `t` (which represents the number of iterations) is printed.

Let's trace the loop execution for the given input:

| Iteration | a1  | a2  | t  |
|----------|-----|-----|----|
| 0        | 100 | 25  | 0  |
| 1        | 98  | 26  | 1  |
| 2        | 96  | 27  | 2  |
| ...      | ... | ... | ...|
| 33       | 34  | 50  | 33 |
| 34       | 32  | 51  | 34 |
| 35       | 30  | 52  | 35 |
| 36       | 28  | 53  | 36 |
| 37       | 26  | 54  | 37 |
| 38       | 24  | 55  | 38 | 
| 39       | 22  | 56  | 39 |
| 40       | 20  | 57  | 40 |
| 41       | 18  | 58  | 41 |
| 42       | 16  | 59  | 42 |
| 43       | 14  | 60  | 43 |
| 44       | 12  | 61  | 44 |
| 45       | 10  | 62  | 45 |
| 46       | 8   | 63  | 46 |
| 47       | 6   | 64  | 47 |
| 48       | 4   | 65  | 48 |
| 49       | 2   | 66  | 49 |
| 50       | 0   | 67  | 50 | 

The loop terminates when `a1` becomes 0.
