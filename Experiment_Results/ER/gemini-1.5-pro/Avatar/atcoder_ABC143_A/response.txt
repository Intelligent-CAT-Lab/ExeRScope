<<<Analysis>>>
First, the input is read and split into two variables: A and B.
In this case, A will be assigned the value 75 and B will be assigned the value 25.
Then, the code calculates the value of  'ans' using the formula: ans = A - 2 * B
So, ans = 75 - 2 * 25 = 25.
The code then checks if the value of 'ans' is less than 0. If it is, then the value of 'ans' is set to 0. In this case, 25 is not less than 0.
Finally, the code prints the value of 'ans', which is 25.
<<<Output>>>
25
