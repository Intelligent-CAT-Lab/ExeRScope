1. **Input:** The code reads a line of input, which is expected to be a string. In this case, the input is "2 2".
2. **Counter:** It creates a Counter object `c` from the input string. A Counter object stores the frequency of each character in the string. In this case, `c` will be `Counter({'2': 2})`.
3. **Calculation:** It calculates `(c["g"] - c["p"]) // 2`. Since "g" and "p" are not present in the input string, their counts in the `c` Counter will be 0. Therefore, the expression becomes (0 - 0) // 2.
4. **Output:** The code prints the result of the calculation, which is 0.
