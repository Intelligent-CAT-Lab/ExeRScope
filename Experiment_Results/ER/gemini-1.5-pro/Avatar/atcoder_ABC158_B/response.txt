<<<Analysis>>>
1.  **Input:** The code takes three integer inputs: N, A, and B. In this case, they are assigned the values:
    *  N = 501719768609305159
    *  A = 370614275896614890
    *  B = 131105492712690269

2.  **Calculate Cycles:**
    *   `ans = N // (A + B) * A`: This line calculates how many times the sum (A + B) fits completely into N and multiplies that by A. This essentially counts the elements contributed by 'A' in complete cycles of (A + B).

3.  **Calculate Remainder:**
    *  `rem = N % (A + B)`: This line calculates the remainder after dividing N by (A + B). This represents the remaining elements after considering complete cycles.

4.  **Handle Remaining Elements:**
    *  `ans += min(rem, A)`:  This line adds the smaller value between 'rem' (remaining elements) and 'A' to 'ans'. This is because we can take at most 'A' elements from the remaining portion.

5.  **Output:** Finally, the code prints the value of 'ans', which represents the total count of elements considered.
