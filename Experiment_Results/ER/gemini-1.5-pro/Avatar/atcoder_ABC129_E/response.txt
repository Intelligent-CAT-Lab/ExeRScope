1. **Reverse the input string:**
   - `l = input()[::-1]` takes the input string and reverses it. For example, if the input is "101",  'l' will become "101".

2. **Initialize 'mod' for modulo operation:**
   - `mod = 10**9 + 7` sets 'mod' to a large prime number (1000000007). This is often used for modulo operations in competitive programming to prevent integer overflows.

3. **Calculate powers of 3 and store in 'pows':**
   - `pows = [1]` initializes a list 'pows' with 1. This list will store powers of 3.
   - The loop `for i in range(10**5 + 10)` iterates from 0 to 100010 (a large number to cover potential input string lengths).
   - Inside the loop,  `pows.append((pows[-1] * 3) % mod)` calculates the next power of 3, taking the modulo with 'mod' to prevent overflow, and appends it to the 'pows' list.

4. **Initialize 'dp' for dynamic programming:**
   - `dp = 1` initializes a variable 'dp' to 1. 'dp' will store intermediate calculation results during the dynamic programming process.

5. **Iterate through the reversed string and apply dynamic programming:**
   - `for i in range(len(l))` iterates through each character of the reversed string 'l'.
   - `if l[i] == '1'`:  If the current character is '1', then:
      - `dp = (pows[i] + dp * 2) % mod` updates 'dp'. It adds the current power of 3 (from 'pows') to twice the previous value of 'dp', and then applies the modulo operation.

6. **Print the final result:**
   - `print(dp)` prints the final value of 'dp' which represents the calculated result based on the input string.

**In essence, the code calculates the sum of powers of 3 for each position where there's a '1' in the input string. The powers of 3 are calculated in advance and stored in the 'pows' list for efficiency. The dynamic programming approach helps to calculate the sum efficiently by reusing previously computed results.**
