1. **input():** The code starts by executing the `input()` function, which waits for user input. In this case, the user inputs the character "c".

2. **ord():** The `ord("c")` function then returns the numerical Unicode representation of the character 'c', which is 99. 

3. **+1:**  1 is added to 99, resulting in 100.

4. **chr():** The `chr(100)` function converts the numerical value 100 back into its corresponding character, which is 'd'.

5. **print():** Finally, the `print()` function outputs the character 'd'.
