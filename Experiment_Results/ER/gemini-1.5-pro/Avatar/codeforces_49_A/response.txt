<<<Analysis>>>
This code determines if the last character of the input string, excluding spaces and question marks, is a vowel.
1. It takes an input string and stores it in the variable "sentence."
2. It initializes two variables: "start" to -1 (used to traverse the string from the end) and "letter" to an empty string.
3. It enters a while loop that continues as long as the condition holds true (and breaks when a suitable character is found).
4. Inside the loop, it checks if the character at the current index "start" in "sentence" is neither a space nor a question mark. If this condition is met, it assigns that character to "letter" and breaks the loop.
5. It decrements "start" by 1 to move to the preceding character in the string for the next iteration.
6. Finally, it checks if the lowercase version of "letter" exists within a list of vowels.
7. It prints "YES" if the last character (excluding spaces and question marks) is a vowel and "NO" otherwise.

For the input "BueDOlxgzeNlxrzRrMbKiQdmGujEKmGxclvaPpTuHmTqBp?", the last character, excluding spaces and question marks, is "p." Since "p" is not a vowel, the code will output "NO."
