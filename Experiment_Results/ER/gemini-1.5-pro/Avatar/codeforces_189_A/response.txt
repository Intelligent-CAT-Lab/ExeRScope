<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called `cutRibbon` that takes no arguments and calculates the maximum number of segments of equal length that can be cut from a ribbon. 

1. **Input and Initialization:**
   - The input is taken as a string of space-separated numbers: "29 27 18 2".
   - `arr` is initialized as a list containing these numbers converted to integers: [29, 27, 18, 2].
   - `length` is assigned the first element of `arr`, which is 29.
   - The sublist `arr[1:4]` (containing the ribbon segment lengths) is sorted in ascending order: [2, 18, 27].

2. **Checking for Direct Divisibility:**
   - The code checks if the ribbon's length (`length`) is directly divisible by the smallest segment length (`arr[0]`, which is 2). 
   - Since 29 is not divisible by 2, this condition fails.

3. **Iterative Calculation:**
   - The code enters the `else` block because the smallest two segment lengths are not equal (`arr[0] != arr[1]`).
   - It initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the maximum number of segments found.
   - It uses two nested loops to iterate through possible combinations of segments of lengths `arr[2]` (18) and `arr[1]` (2).
     - The outer loop iterates `i` from 0 to the maximum possible number of segments of length `arr[2]` that can fit within `length`.
     - The inner loop iterates `j` from 0 to the maximum possible number of segments of length `arr[1]` that can fit within the remaining length (`length - i * arr[2]`).
     - For each combination of `i` and `j`, it calculates the remaining length (`check`).
     - If `check` is non-negative and divisible by `arr[0]` (2), it calculates the number of segments of length `arr[0]` that can be cut from `check` (`k`).
     - It updates `ans` with the maximum value between the current `ans` and the total number of segments (`k + i + j`).

4. **Output:**
   - After all iterations, the code prints the value of `ans`, which represents the maximum number of segments of equal length that can be cut from the ribbon.
