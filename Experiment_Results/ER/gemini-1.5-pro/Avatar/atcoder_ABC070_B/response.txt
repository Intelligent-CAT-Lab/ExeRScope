<<<Analysis>>>
Four variables a, b, c, and d are assigned values from the user's input: 0, 50, 50, and 100 respectively.
The code then calculates the difference between the minimum of (b, d) and the maximum of (a, c).
- min(b, d) results in 50 (minimum of 50 and 100).
- max(a, c) results in 50 (maximum of 0 and 50).
Therefore, the difference is 50 - 50 = 0.
Finally, the code prints the maximum value between 0 and the calculated difference (which is 0 in this case).
