<<<Analysis>>>
1. The variable `a` is initialized with the input value `733035`.
2. The `for` loop iterates from `a` (733035) down to 1, decreasing by 1 in each iteration.
3. In each iteration, the code checks if `a` is divisible by `i` without remainder (`a % i == 0`).
4. If the condition is true, it means `i` is a divisor of `a`. The code then prints the divisor `i` followed by a space. 
5. Additionally, the value of `a` is updated to the current divisor `i`. This effectively means that in the subsequent iterations, the code will only be checking divisors of the latest `i`. 
6. This process continues until the loop reaches 1.

Therefore, the code will print the divisors of 733035 in descending order, but only until the latest divisor is found.
