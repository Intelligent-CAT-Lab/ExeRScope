<<<Analysis>>>
1.  **Input:** The code takes a single line input string '1000000000000 1000000000000 1000000000000'.
2.  **Parsing Input:** This input is then split into three strings based on three spaces ('   ') as the delimiter. These strings are then typecast into integers and assigned to variables 'a', 'b', and 'k' respectively. So, a = 1000000000000, b = 1000000000000, and k= 1000000000000.
3.  **Calculation:** The code calculates 'res' as the difference between 'a' and 'k', resulting in res = 0.
4. **Conditional Checks:** Since 'res' is not less than 0, the 'else' block is executed. 
5.  **Output:** Finally, the values of 'a' (which is 0) and 'b' (which remains 1000000000000) are printed with a space between them.
