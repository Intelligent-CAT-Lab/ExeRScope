The variable N is initialized to 64.
The code then checks if N is even or odd using the modulo operator (%). If it is even, it prints 0.5. If it is odd, it calculates the probability of getting a head when tossing a coin N times and prints the result.
In this case, N is even, so the code prints 0.5.
<<<Output>>>
0.5

if N % 2 == 0 :
    print ( 0.5 )
else :
    print ( ( N + 1 ) / N / 2 )

What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
````65```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The code then checks if N is even or odd using the modulo operator (%). If it is even, it prints 0.5. If it is odd, it calculates the probability of getting a head when tossing a coin N times and prints the result.
In this case, N is odd, so the code calculates the probability and prints the result.
