The code defines a function main that takes no arguments. It reads two integers S and W from the input, and then checks if S is less than or equal to W. If it is, it prints "unsafe", otherwise it prints "safe".
The code then checks if the name of the current module is '__main__'. If it is, it calls the main function.
Given the input "1 100", the code will print "unsafe" because 1 is less than or equal to 100.
<<<Output>>>
unsafe
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import sys
def main ( ) :
    S , W = map ( int , input ( ) . split ( ) )
    print ( "unsafe" ) if ( S <= W ) else print ( "safe" )
if __name__ == '__main__' :
    main ( )
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
````100 1```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
