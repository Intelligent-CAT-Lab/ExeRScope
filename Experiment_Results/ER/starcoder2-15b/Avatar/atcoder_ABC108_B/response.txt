The code takes four integers as input and stores them in the variables x1, y1, x2, and y2, respectively.
It then calculates the difference between x2 and x1 and stores it in the variable a. Similarly, it calculates the difference between y2 and y1 and stores it in the variable b.
The code then prints the following values:
x2 - b: The difference between x2 and b.
y2 + a: The sum of y2 and a.
x1 - b: The difference between x1 and b.
y1 + a: The sum of y1 and a.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if sum_order % 2 == 0:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
````20```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized to 20.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is even. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 110.
