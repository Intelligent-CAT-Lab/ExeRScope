The code takes two inputs, a and b, separated by a space. It then reverses the digits of b and stores it in b. Finally, it adds a and b and prints the result.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def func(a, b):
    if a == 0:
        return b
    return func(a - 1, a + b)
print(func(4, 2))

<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```````
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function func that takes two parameters a and b.
If a is equal to 0, the function returns b.
Otherwise, it calls itself with a - 1 and a + b as parameters, and returns the result.
The code then calls the func function with 4 and 2 as parameters, and prints the result.
The func function is called with a = 4 and b = 2.
Since a is not equal to 0, the function calls itself with a - 1 = 3 and a + b = 6 as parameters.
The func function is called with a = 3 and b = 6.
Since a is not equal to 0, the function calls itself with a - 1 = 2 and a + b = 9 as parameters.
The func function is called with a = 2 and b = 9.
Since a is not equal to 0, the function calls itself with a - 1 = 1 and a + b = 11 as parameters.
The func function is called with a = 1 and b = 11.
Since a is not equal to 0, the function calls itself with a - 1 = 0 and a + b = 12 as parameters.
The func function is called with a = 0 and b = 12.
Since a is equal to 0, the function returns b, which is 12.
The func function returns 12.
The func function returns 11.
The func function returns 9.
The func function returns 6.
The func function returns 2.
The code prints 2.
