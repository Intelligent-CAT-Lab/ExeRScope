The code takes a single character as input and adds 1 to its ASCII value.
The input character 'c' has an ASCII value of 99.
After adding 1, the ASCII value becomes 100, which corresponds to the character 'd'.
The code prints the resulting character 'd'.
<<<Output>>>
d

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def func(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * func(n-1)
print(func(5))
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
````None```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function func that takes an integer n as input and returns the factorial of n.
The function uses recursion to calculate the factorial of n.
When n is 0, the function returns 1.
When n is greater than 0, the function calls itself with n-1 as the argument and multiplies the result with n.
The code then calls the func function with 5 as the argument and prints the result, which is 120.
<<<Output>>>
120
