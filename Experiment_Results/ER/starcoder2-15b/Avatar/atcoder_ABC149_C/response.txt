The code defines a function hoge that takes an integer n as input and returns True if n is a prime number, and False otherwise.
The function checks if n is 2, and if so, returns True.
If n is not 2, the function iterates over all numbers x from 2 to the square root of n + 2, and checks if n is divisible by x. If it is, the function returns False.
If n is not divisible by any x, the function returns True.
The code then reads an integer N from the input and enters a loop that increments N by 1 each time.
For each value of N, the code calls the hoge function and checks if it returns True. If it does, the code prints N and exits the loop.
The code will continue to increment N until it finds a prime number, and then print it.
