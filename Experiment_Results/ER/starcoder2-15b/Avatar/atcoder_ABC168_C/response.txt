The code takes four inputs a, b, h, and m, which represent the length of the hour hand, the length of the minute hand, the hour, and the minute, respectively.
It then calculates the angle theta_h of the hour hand and the angle theta_m of the minute hand using the given formulas.
The code then calculates the coordinates of the hour hand (x_h, y_h) and the minute hand (x_m, y_m) using the cosine and sine functions.
Finally, it calculates the distance between the two hands using the coordinates and prints it.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import math
a , b , h , m = map ( int , input ( ) . split ( ) )
theta_h = 2.5 * math . pi - ( 2 * math . pi * ( ( h + ( m / 60 ) ) / 12 ) )
theta_m = 2.5 * math . pi - ( 2 * math . pi * ( m / 60 ) )
x_h = a * math . cos ( theta_h )
y_h = a * math . sin ( theta_h )
x_m = b * math . cos ( theta_m )
y_m = b * math . sin ( theta_m )
print ( ( ( x_h - x_m ) ** 2 + ( y_h - y_m ) ** 2 ) ** 0.5 )
