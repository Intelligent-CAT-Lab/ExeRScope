The variable k, variable n and variable w are initialized to 1000, 1000000000 and 1000, respectively.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to w (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 1000.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of the first i numbers multiplied by k and stores it in sum.
The code checks if sum is less than or equal to n. If it is, it prints 0. Otherwise, it prints the difference between sum and n.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum, which is 500500000.
<<<Output>>>
500500000

Consider the following code:
<Code>
n = int(input())
sum = 0
for i in range(1,n+1):
    sum += i
print(sum)

What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
````100```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The variable n is initialized to 100.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 100.
For each number i in this range, it adds i to sum.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum, which is 5050.
<<<Output>>>
5050
