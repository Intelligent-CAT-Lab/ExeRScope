The code takes two integers a and b as input, and initializes a variable c to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates twice.
For each iteration, it adds the maximum of a and b to c, and then subtracts 1 from the larger of a and b.
After the loop, the code prints the value of c, which is 14.
<<<Output>>>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
a , b = map ( int , input ( ) . split ( ) )
c = 0
for i in range ( 2 ) :
    c += max ( a , b )
    if a >= b :
        a -= 1
    else :
        b -= 1
print(c)
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
````6 6```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
