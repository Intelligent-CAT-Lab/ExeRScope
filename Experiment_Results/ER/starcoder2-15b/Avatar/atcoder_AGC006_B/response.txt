The variable N is initialized to 2 and the variable x is initialized to 1.
The code then checks if x is equal to 1 or 2 * N - 1, which is 3 in this case. Since x is equal to 1, the code prints "No" and exits.
<<<Output>>>
No

Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int ( input ( ) )
l = [ int ( i ) for i in input ( ) . split ( ) ]
l . sort ( )
for i in range ( N ) :
    if l [ i ] > l [ i + 1 ] :
        print ( "NO" )
        break
else :
    print ( "YES" )
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
````5
1 2 3 4 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized to 5 and the variable l is initialized to [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
The code then sorts the list l in ascending order.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to N - 1, meaning it will consider the first 5 elements of the list l.
For each element l[i] in this range, it checks if l[i] is greater than l[i+1]. Since l[i] is always less than or equal to l[i+1], the loop will not break and will continue to the else block.
The else block prints "YES" and the code exits.
<<<Output>>>
YES
