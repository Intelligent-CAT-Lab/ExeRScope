The code takes an integer input x and defines a function factorization that takes an integer n as an argument.
The function factorization finds the prime factors of n and returns them as a list of lists, where each list contains a prime factor and its corresponding exponent.
The code then calls the factorization function with x as the argument and stores the result in l.
The list l is then sorted in ascending order.
The code then initializes ans to 0 and enters a loop that iterates over the elements of l.
For each element, if the first element of the list is 1, the code continues to the next iteration.
Otherwise, the code initializes s to 0 and num to the second element of the list.
If num is 1, the code sets j to 1.
Otherwise, the code enters a loop that iterates over the range 1 to num - 1.
For each value of j, the code adds j to s and checks if s is equal to num.
If it is, the loop breaks.
If s is greater than num, the code decrements j by 1 and breaks the loop.
The code then adds j to ans.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the value of ans.
