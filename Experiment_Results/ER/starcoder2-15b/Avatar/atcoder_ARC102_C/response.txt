The variable K and N are initialized to 1 and 200000, respectively.
The variable mod is initialized to 998244353.
The function inved(a) calculates the modular inverse of a modulo mod.
The code initializes an array X of length 2 * K - 1, filled with zeros.
The code initializes an array frac with the factorials of numbers from 0 to N + K.
The code initializes an array invf with the modular inverses of the factorials in frac.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 2 to K + 2, which is 3 in this case.
For each value of k, the code calculates the sum S of certain products.
The code initializes sign to 1 and l to k // 2, which is 1.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to min(l + 1, N // 2 + 1), which is 1.
For each value of m, the code calculates a product prod.
The code multiplies prod by the modular inverse of the factorial of m, the modular inverse of the factorial of l - m, the modular inverse of the factorial of N - 2 * m, and the modular inverse of the factorial of K - 1.
The code adds prod to S and sets sign to -sign.
The code sets X[k - 2] and X[2 * K - k] to S.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 2 * K - 1, which is 1.
For each value of i, the code prints the value of X[i].
