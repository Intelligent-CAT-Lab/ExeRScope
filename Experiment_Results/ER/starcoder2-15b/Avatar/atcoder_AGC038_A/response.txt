The code defines a function solve that takes four parameters: H, W, A, and B. It then creates a 2D array of size H x W, where each element is initialized to "0".
The code then iterates through each element of the array and assigns a value based on the position of the element and the values of A and B. If the element is in the top-left quadrant (i.e., i < B and j < A), it is assigned the value "0". If it is in the top-right quadrant (i.e., i < B and j >= A), it is assigned the value "1". If it is in the bottom-left quadrant (i.e., i >= B and j < A), it is assigned the value "1". If it is in the bottom-right quadrant (i.e., i >= B and j >= A), it is assigned the value "0".
Finally, the code prints the array, where each element is separated by a space.
