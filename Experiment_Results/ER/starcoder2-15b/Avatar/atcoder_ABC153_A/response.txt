The code imports the math module and uses it to calculate the ceiling of a division.
The input is split into two variables, h and a, which are 10000 and 1, respectively.
The code then calculates the ceiling of h divided by a, which is 10000.
The output is the ceiling of the division, which is 10000.
<<<Output>>>
10000

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import math
h , a = map ( int , input ( ) . split ( ) )
print ( math . ceil ( h / a ) )
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
````10000 1000```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
