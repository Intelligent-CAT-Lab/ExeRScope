The variables anti, b, c, and d are initialized to 4, 0, 0, and 4, respectively.
The code then calculates the absolute difference between anti and c and stores it in l.
It also calculates the absolute difference between b and d and stores it in m.
The code then checks if anti is equal to c. If it is, it prints anti + m, b, c + m, and d.
If anti is not equal to c, it checks if b is equal to d. If it is, it prints anti, b + l, c, and d + l.
If neither of these conditions is met, it checks if l is not equal to m. If it is, it prints -1.
If all of these conditions are not met, it prints anti, d, c, and b.
In this case, anti is equal to c, so the code prints 4 4 4 4.
<<<Output>>>
4 4 4 4

Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if sum_order % 2 == 0:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
````20```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized to 20.
The variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is even. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 110.
<<<Output>>>
