The code defines several functions and variables, including mod, inf, and solve.
The solve function takes no arguments and returns nothing. It first reads an integer n from the input.
Then, it initializes ans to 0.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n + 1. For each i in this range, it calculates x as the integer division of n by i.
It then adds i * (1 + x) * x // 2 to ans.
After the loop, the code prints the value of ans.
The code then checks if the name of the current module is '__main__'. If it is, it calls the solve function.
The input is 9995083.
The code calls the solve function, which reads the input and initializes ans to 0.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n + 1, which is 9995084.
For each i in this range, it calculates x as the integer division of n by i.
It then adds i * (1 + x) * x // 2 to ans.
After the loop, the code prints the value of ans, which is 499754100000000.
