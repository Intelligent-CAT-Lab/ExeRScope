The code takes an integer input from the user and stores it in the variable x.
The code then checks if x is equal to 1. If it is, it prints 0. Otherwise, it prints 1.
Since the input is 0, the code prints 1 as the output.

What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
````1```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
