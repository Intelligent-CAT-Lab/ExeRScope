The variable K is initialized to 260522.
The code then checks if K is even. If it is, it prints -1 and exits the program.
If K is odd, the code enters a loop that iterates up to 10^6 times.
For each iteration, it increments cnt by 1 and calculates the remainder of (now * 10 + 7) modulo K.
The code checks if the remainder is 0. If it is, it prints cnt and exits the program.
If the loop finishes without finding a remainder of 0, it prints -1.
<<<Output>>>
-1

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import sys
from collections import defaultdict
K = int ( input ( ) )
cnt = 0
now = 0
if K % 2 == 0 :
    print (-1)
    sys . exit ( 0 )
for i in range ( 10 ** 6 ) :
    cnt += 1
    now = ( now * 10 + 7 ) % K
    if now == 0 :
        print (cnt)
        sys . exit ( 0 )
print (-1)
</Code>

What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
````260523```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
