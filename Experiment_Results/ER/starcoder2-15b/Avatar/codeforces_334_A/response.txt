The variable n is initialized to 6.
The code then initializes two variables i and j to 1 and n * n, respectively.
The code enters a while loop that continues to execute as long as i is less than j.
Inside the loop, it prints the values of i and j, then increments i by 1 and decrements j by 1.
The loop continues until i becomes equal to j, at which point the loop terminates.
The output of the code will be a series of pairs of numbers, starting with 1 and 36, and decreasing by 1 each time.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
n = int ( input ( ) )
i , j = 1 , n * n
while i < j :
    print ( i , j )
    i += 1
    j -= 1

What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
````10```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The code enters a while loop that continues to execute as long as i is less than j.
Inside the loop, it prints the values of i and j, then increments i by 1 and decrements j by 1.
Since i is already equal to j, the loop condition is not met and the loop does not execute.
The output of the code will be empty.
