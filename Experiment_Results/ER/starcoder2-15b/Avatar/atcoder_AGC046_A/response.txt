The variable X is initialized to 1.
The code then enters a while loop that will continue to execute until the break statement is reached.
Inside the loop, the variable a is incremented by X.
The code then checks if a is divisible by 360. If it is, it prints the value of i and breaks out of the loop.
Since X is 1, a will be incremented by 1 each time the loop runs.
When a is 360, the condition a % 360 == 0 will be met, and the loop will break.
The value of i at this point will be 360, so the code will print 360 as the output.
<<<Output>>>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int ( input ( ) )
i = 1
while i <= N :
    if i % 2 == 0 :
        print ( i )
    i += 1
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
````10```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized to 10.
The code then enters a while loop that will continue to execute until the condition i <= N is no longer true.
Inside the loop, the code checks if i is even by checking if i % 2 == 0. If it is, it prints the value of i.
The value of i is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration of the loop.
Since N is 10, the loop will run 10 times, printing the even numbers from 2 to 10.
