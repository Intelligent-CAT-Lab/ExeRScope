Inside the test() method, the SplitSentence() class is instantiated and assigned to the variable ss.
The split_sentences() method is called on ss with the argument "Who is A.B.C.? He is a teacher.".
Inside the split_sentences() method, the sentences_string argument is assigned to the variable sentences_string.
The re.split() function is called with the following arguments:
r'(?<!\w\.\w.)(?<![A-Z][a-z]\.)(?<=\.|\?)\s': This is a regular expression that matches a space character (\s) that is preceded by a period (\.), question mark (\?), or a combination of a period and a question mark (\.|\?). The (?<!\w\.\w.) and (?<![A-Z][a-z]\.)) parts of the expression are negative lookbehinds that ensure that the space character is not preceded by a period followed by a word character (\w) or a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter.
sentences_string: This is the string that will be split based on the regular expression.
The result of the re.split() function is assigned to the variable sentences.
The sentences variable is returned.
<<<Output>>>
['Who is A.B.C.', 'He is a teacher.']

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import unittest
import re


class SplitSentence:

    def split_sentences(self, sentences_string):
        sentences = re.split(r'(?<!\w\.\w.)(?<![A-Z][a-z]\.)(?<=\.|\?)\s', sentences_string)
        return sentences

    def count_words(self, sentence):
        sentence = re.sub(r'[^a-zA-Z\s]', '', sentence)
        words = sentence.split()
        return len(words)

    def process_text_file(self, sentences_string):
        sentences = self.split_sentences(sentences_string)
        max_count = 0
        for sentence in sentences:
            count = self.count_words(sentence)
            if count > max_count:
                max_count = count

        return max_count
class Test(unittest.TestCase):
    def test(self):
            ss = SplitSentence()
            lst = ss.split_sentences("Who is A.B.C.? He is a teacher.")
            return lst
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
