Inside the test() method, the read_excel() method is invoked with the test_file_name as the argument.
Inside the read_excel() method, the data list is initialized to an empty list.
A try-except block is used to handle any exceptions that may occur during the execution of the code.
Inside the try block, the openpyxl.load_workbook() function is used to load the Excel file specified by file_name.
The workbook object is then used to access the active sheet, which is stored in the sheet variable.
A for loop is used to iterate over the rows in the sheet, and the values_only=True argument is passed to the iter_rows() method to return only the values of the cells in each row.
The values of the cells in each row are appended to the data list.
The workbook.close() method is called to close the workbook.
The data list is returned.
If an exception occurs during the execution of the code, the except block is executed, and None is returned.

class ArrangementCalculator:
    def __init__(self, datas):
        self.datas = datas

    @staticmethod
    def count(n, m=None):
        if m is None or n == m:
            return ArrangementCalculator.factorial(n)
        else:
            return ArrangementCalculator.factorial(n) // ArrangementCalculator.factorial(n - m)

    @staticmethod
    def count_all(n):
        total = 0
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            total += ArrangementCalculator.count(n, i)
        return total

    def select(self, m=None):
        if m is None:
            m = len(self.datas)
        result = []
        for permutation in itertools.permutations(self.datas, m):
            result.append(list(permutation))
        return result

    def select_all(self):
        result = []
        for i in range(1, len(self.datas) + 1):
            result.extend(self.select(i))
        return result

    @staticmethod
    def factorial(n):
        result = 1
        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            result *= i
        return result
class Test(unittest.TestCase):
    def test(self):
            res = ArrangementCalculator.count_all(6)

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
Inside the test() method, the ArrangementCalculator.count_all(6) method is invoked. The purpose of this method is to calculate the total number of arrangements of a given number of elements. In this case, the number of elements is 6.
Inside the count_all() method, the total variable is initialized to 0.
A for loop iterates from 1 to n + 1 (which is 7 in this case), calling the ArrangementCalculator.count() method for each value of i.
The count() method is a static method that calculates the number of arrangements of m elements from a set of n elements. In this case, n is 6 and m is i, which is 1 to 6.
The count() method is implemented using the factorial() method, which calculates the factorial of a given number.
The factorial() method is implemented using a for loop that multiplies the result by each integer in the range from 2 to n + 1.
The count() method returns the result of the factorial() method.
The count_all() method adds the result of the count() method to the total variable.
After the loop completes, the method returns total, which is the total number of arrangements of 6 elements.
