Inside the test() method, the NLPDataProcessor class is instantiated and assigned to the self.processor variable.
The construct_stop_word_list() method is called on the self.processor object, and the returned value is assigned to the stop_word_list variable.
The expected_stop_words variable is initialized to a list containing the strings 'a', 'an', and 'the'.
The stop_word_list and expected_stop_words variables are returned as a tuple.
<<<Output>>>
(['a', 'an', 'the'], ['a', 'an', 'the'])

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import unittest
class NLPDataProcessor:

    def construct_stop_word_list(self):
        stop_word_list = ['a', 'an', 'the']
        return stop_word_list

<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method, the NLPDataProcessor class is instantiated and assigned to the self.processor variable.
The string_list variable is initialized to a list containing two strings: 'I am a boy' and 'You are a girl'.
The process() method is called on the self.processor object, passing in the string_list as an argument.
The construct_stop_word_list() method is called on the self.processor object, and the returned value is assigned to the stop_word_list variable.
The remove_stop_words() method is called on the self.processor object, passing in the string_list and stop_word_list as arguments.
Inside the remove_stop_words() method, the answer list is initialized to an empty list.
A for loop iterates over each string in the string_list.
For each string, the split() method is called on it, and the result is assigned to the string_split variable.
Another for loop iterates over each word in the string_split list.
If the word is in the stop_word_list, it is removed from the string_split list using the remove() method.
The string_split list is appended to the answer list.
The answer list is returned from the remove_stop_words() method.
The words_list variable is assigned the value returned from the process() method.
The expected_words_list variable is initialized to a list containing two lists: ['I', 'boy'] and ['You', 'girl'].
The words_list and expected_words_list variables are returned as a tuple.
<<<Output>>>
([['I', 'boy'], ['You', 'girl']], [['I', 'boy'], ['You', 'girl']])
