Inside the test() method, the TimeUtils() class is instantiated and assigned to the timeutils variable.
The add_seconds() method is called on the timeutils object, passing in the argument 300.
Inside the add_seconds() method, the datetime attribute of the timeutils object is added to a datetime.timedelta object with a seconds argument of 300.
The resulting datetime object is assigned to the new_datetime variable.
The new_datetime object is formatted using the "%H:%M:%S" format string and returned.
The datetime attribute of the timeutils object is also formatted using the "%H:%M:%S" format string and returned.

<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
