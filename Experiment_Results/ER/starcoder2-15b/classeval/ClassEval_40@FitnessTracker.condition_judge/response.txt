Inside the test() method, a FitnessTracker object is created with the following parameters:
height = 1.8
weight = 45
age = 20
sex = "female"
The condition_judge() method is then called on the object.
Inside the condition_judge() method, the get_BMI() method is called, which returns the BMI value of the object.
The BMI value is then compared to the BMI range for males and females.
Since the sex is "female", the BMI_range is set to [19, 24].
If the BMI is greater than 24, the method returns 1, indicating that the person is too fat.
If the BMI is less than 19, the method returns -1, indicating that the person is too thin.
If the BMI is between 19 and 24, the method returns 0, indicating that the person is in a normal weight range.
In this case, the BMI is 18.5, which is less than 19. Therefore, the method returns -1.
<<<Output>>>
-1

<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method, a FitnessTracker object is created with the following parameters:
height = 1.8
weight = 45
age = 20
sex = "female"
The calculate_calorie_intake() method is then called on the object.
Inside the calculate_calorie_intake() method, the condition_judge() method is called, which returns the condition of the person based on their BMI.
If the condition is 1, indicating that the person is too fat, the calorie_intake is set to BMR * 1.2, which is the calorie intake for a sedentary lifestyle.
If the condition is -1, indicating that the person is too thin, the calorie_intake is set to BMR * 1.6, which is the calorie intake for an active lifestyle.
If the condition is 0, indicating that the person is in a normal weight range, the calorie_intake is set to BMR * 1.4
