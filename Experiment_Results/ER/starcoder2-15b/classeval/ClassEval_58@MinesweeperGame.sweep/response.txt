Inside the test() method, a MinesweeperGame object is created with n = 3 and k = 1.
The generate_mine_sweeper_map() method is called, which generates a 3x3 matrix with some mines and numbers.
The generate_playerMap() method is called, which generates a 3x3 matrix with all '-' values.
The check_won() method is called, which checks if the player has won the game.
The sweep() method is called with x = 0 and y = 0.
Inside the sweep() method, the player_map[x][y] is set to the value of minesweeper_map[x][y], which is 'X'.
The score is incremented by 1.
The check_won() method is called again, which returns False because the player has not won the game yet.
The player_map is returned.
<<<Output>>>
([['X', '-', '-'], ['-', '-', '-'], ['-', '-', '-']], 1)

<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method, a LinkedList object is created.
The insert() method is called five times, inserting the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 into the linked list.
The reverse() method is called, which reverses the order of the nodes in the linked list.
The print_list() method is called, which prints the data of each node in the linked list.
<<<Output>>>
