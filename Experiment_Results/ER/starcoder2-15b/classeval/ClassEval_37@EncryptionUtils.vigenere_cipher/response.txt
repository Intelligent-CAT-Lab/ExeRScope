Inside the test() method, an EncryptionUtils object is created with the key "key".
The vigenere_cipher() method is called on the encryption_utils object with the argument "abc".
Inside the vigenere_cipher() method, the encrypted_text variable is initialized to an empty string.
The key_index variable is initialized to 0.
A for loop iterates over each character in the plain_text argument.
Inside the for loop, if the current character is an alphabetic character, the shift variable is calculated based on the current character of the key.
The encrypted_char variable is calculated based on the current character of the plain_text and the shift.
The encrypted_char variable is added to the encrypted_text variable.
If the current character is not an alphabetic character, it is added to the encrypted_text variable.
After the for loop, the encrypted_text variable is returned.

<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method, an EncryptionUtils object is created with the key "key".
The rail_fence_cipher() method is called on the encryption_utils object with the arguments "abc" and 2.
Inside the rail_fence_cipher() method, the fence variable is initialized to a list of lists, where each inner list contains '\n' characters.
The direction variable is initialized to -1.
The row and col variables are initialized to 0.
A for loop iterates over each character in the plain_text argument.
Inside the for loop, if the row variable is 0 or equal to rails - 1 (which is 2 - 1 = 1 in this case), the direction variable is set to -direction (which is -(-1) = 1).
The current character of the plain_text is assigned to the corresponding position in the fence variable.
The col variable is incremented by 1.
The row variable is incremented by direction (which is 1 in this case).
After the for loop, the encrypted_text variable is initialized to an empty string.
A nested for loop iterates over each row and column in the fence variable.
Inside the nested for loop, if the current character in the fence variable is not '\n', it is added
