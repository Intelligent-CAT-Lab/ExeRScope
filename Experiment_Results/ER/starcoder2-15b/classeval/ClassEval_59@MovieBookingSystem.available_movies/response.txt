Inside the test() method, the MovieBookingSystem class is instantiated and assigned to the self.system variable.
The add_movie() method is called twice, adding two movies to the system. The first movie is 'Batman', with a price of 49.9, starting at 17:05 and ending at 19:25, and a 3x3 seating arrangement. The second movie is 'Spiderman', with a price of 59.9, starting at 20:00 and ending at 22:30, and a 4x4 seating arrangement.
The available_movies() method is called with the arguments '20:00' and '23:00'. This means that we are looking for movies that start between 20:00 and 23:00.
Inside the available_movies() method, the start_time and end_time arguments are converted to datetime objects using the datetime.strptime() method.
An empty list, available_movies, is created to store the names of available movies.
A for loop iterates over each movie in the self.movies list.
Inside the loop, the start_time and end_time of the current movie are compared to the start_time and end_time arguments passed to the method. If the start_time of the movie is greater than or equal to the start_time argument and the end_time of the movie is less than or equal to the end_time argument, the name of the movie is appended to the available_movies list.
After the loop completes, the available_movies list is returned.

<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method, a LinkedList object is instantiated and assigned to the self.list variable.
The insert() method is called three times, inserting the values 1, 2, and 3 into the linked list.
The reverse() method is called, reversing the order of the nodes in the linked list.
The print_list() method is called, printing the data of each node in the linked list.
Inside the reverse() method, the prev, current, and next variables are initialized to None, self.head, and None, respectively.
A while loop iterates while current is not None.
Inside the loop, the next variable is assigned to the next node in the linked list.
The next node in the linked list is assigned to current.next.
The current node is assigned to prev.
The current node is assigned to current.
After the loop completes, the head of the linked list is assigned to prev.
Inside the print_list() method, the current variable is initialized to self.head.
A while loop iterates while current is not None.
Inside the loop, the data of the current node is printed.
The next node in the linked list is assigned to current.
After the loop completes, the method returns.
