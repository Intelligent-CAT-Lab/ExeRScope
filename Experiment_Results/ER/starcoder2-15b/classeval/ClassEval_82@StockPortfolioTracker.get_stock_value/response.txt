Inside the test() method, a StockPortfolioTracker object is created with a cash_balance of 10000.0.
The get_stock_value() method is invoked with a stock dictionary as an argument. The stock dictionary has the following values:
name: 'AAPL'
price: 0.0
quantity: 10
Inside the get_stock_value() method, the value of the stock is calculated by multiplying the price (0.0) and the quantity (10).
The method returns the calculated value, which is 0.0.
<<<Output>>>
0.0

<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method, a StockPortfolioTracker object is created with a cash_balance of 10000.0.
The add_stock() method is invoked twice with two different stock dictionaries as arguments.
The first stock dictionary has the following values:
name: 'AAPL'
price: 100.0
quantity: 10
The second stock dictionary has the following values:
name: 'AAPL'
price: 100.0
quantity: 10
Inside the add_stock() method, the portfolio list is iterated over.
For the first iteration, the stock dictionary's name ('AAPL') is compared to the name of the first stock in the portfolio list. Since they are the same, the quantity of the first stock in the portfolio list is increased by 10.
For the second iteration, the stock dictionary's name ('AAPL') is compared to the name of the second stock in the portfolio list. Since they are the same, the quantity of the second stock in the portfolio list is increased by 10.
After the add_stock() method is invoked twice, the portfolio list contains two stocks with the same name ('AAPL') and a total quantity of 20.
The get_portfolio_summary() method is invoked.
Inside the get_portfolio_summary() method, the summary list is initialized to an empty list.
