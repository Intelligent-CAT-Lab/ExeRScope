Inside the test() method, a GomokuGame object is created with a board size of 10. The check_winner() method is then called on the gomokuGame object.
Inside the check_winner() method, the directions variable is defined, which represents the four possible directions in which a player can win: horizontal, vertical, and two diagonal directions.
A nested for loop iterates over each cell in the board. For each cell, the _check_five_in_a_row() method is called with the current row, column, and each direction in the directions list.
Inside the _check_five_in_a_row() method, the dx and dy variables are assigned the values of the direction tuple. The count variable is initialized to 1, and the symbol variable is assigned the value of the symbol at the current row and column.
A for loop iterates from 1 to 4, representing the four directions in which a player can win. For each iteration, the new_row and new_col variables are calculated based on the current row, column, and direction.
If the new_row or new_col is outside the board, the loop continues to the next iteration.
If the symbol at the new_row and new_col is not the same as the current symbol, the loop continues to the next iteration.
If both conditions are met, the count variable is incremented by 1.
After the loop completes, the method returns True if count is equal to 5, indicating that the current player has won.

<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method, a GomokuGame object is created with a board size of 10. The make_move() method is called on the gomokuGame object with the coordinates (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), and (0, 4).
The make_move() method checks if the cell at the given coordinates is empty. If it is, it sets the cell to the current player's symbol ('X' or 'O') and switches the current player.
After the make_move() calls,
