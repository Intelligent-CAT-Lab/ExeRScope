Inside the test() method, a FitnessTracker object is created with the following parameters:
height = 1.72
weight = 65
age = 20
sex = "male"
The get_BMI() method is called on the object, which returns the BMI (Body Mass Index) of the person.
Inside the get_BMI() method, the BMI is calculated using the formula:
BMI = weight / height ** 2
In this case, the weight is 65 kg and the height is 1.72 m.
The height is squared using the ** operator, and the result is divided by the weight.
The result of the calculation is 21.991150442477876.

What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method, a FitnessTracker object is created with the following parameters:
height = 1.72
weight = 65
age = 20
sex = "male"
The condition_judge() method is called on the object, which returns the condition of the person based on their BMI.
Inside the condition_judge() method, the get_BMI() method is called to calculate the BMI of the person.
The BMI is calculated using the formula:
BMI = weight / height ** 2
In this case, the weight is 65 kg and the height is 1.72 m.
The height is squared using the ** operator, and the result is divided by the weight.
The result of the calculation is 21.991150442477876.
The BMI is then compared to the standard BMI ranges for males and females.
If the BMI is greater than the upper limit of the range, the person is considered "too fat" and the method returns 1.
If the BMI is less than the lower limit of the range, the person is considered "too thin" and the method returns -1.
If the BMI is within the range, the person is considered "normal" and the method returns 0.
In this case,
