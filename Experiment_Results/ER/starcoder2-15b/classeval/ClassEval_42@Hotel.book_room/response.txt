Inside the test() method, a Hotel object is created with the name 'peace hotel' and the available rooms dictionary {'single': 3, 'double': 2}.
The book_room() method is called with the arguments 'single', 2, and 'guest 1'.
Inside the book_room() method, the room_type 'single' is checked to see if it is in the available_rooms dictionary. It is, so the if statement is not executed.
The if statement checks if the room_number (2) is less than or equal to the number of available rooms for the room_type 'single' (3). It is, so the if statement is not executed.
The if statement checks if the room_type 'single' is in the booked_rooms dictionary. It is not, so the if statement is executed.
Inside the if statement, the room_type 'single' is added to the booked_rooms dictionary as a key with an empty dictionary as its value.
The booked_rooms dictionary is updated to {'single': {'guest 1': 2}}.
The available_rooms dictionary is updated to {'single': 1, 'double': 2}.
The book_room() method returns 'Success!'.
<<<Output>>>
('Success!', {'single': {'guest 1': 2}}, {'single': 1, 'double': 2})

<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
