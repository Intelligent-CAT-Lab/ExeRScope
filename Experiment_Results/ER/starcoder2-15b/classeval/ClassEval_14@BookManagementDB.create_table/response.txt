Inside the test() method, the BookManagementDB class is instantiated with the db_name "test.db".
The connection to the database is established using the sqlite3 module.
The cursor object is created to execute SQL queries.
The create_table() method is called to create the "books" table if it does not exist.
The search_books() method is called to retrieve all books from the database.
The cursor.execute() method is used to execute an SQL query to select all rows from the "books" table.
The cursor.fetchall() method is used to retrieve all rows from the result set.
The books variable is assigned the result of the cursor.fetchall() method.
The books variable is returned as the result of the test() method.

<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
