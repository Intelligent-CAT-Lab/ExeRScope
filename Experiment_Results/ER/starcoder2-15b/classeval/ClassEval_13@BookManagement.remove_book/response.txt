Inside the test() method, the BookManagement class is instantiated and assigned to the bookManagement variable.
The add_book() method is called twice on the bookManagement object, adding two books to the inventory. The first book is "book1" with a quantity of 2, and the second book is "book2" with a quantity of 1.
The remove_book() method is called on the bookManagement object, removing 2 copies of "book1" from the inventory.
The view_inventory() method is called on the bookManagement object, returning the inventory dictionary.
<<<Output>>>
{'book2': 1}

    def __init__(self):
        self.inventory = {}

    def add_book(self, title, quantity=1):
        if title in self.inventory:

        if title not in self.inventory or self.inventory[title] < quantity:
            raise False
        self.inventory[title] -= quantity
        if self.inventory[title] == 0:
            del (self.inventory[title])

    def view_inventory(self):
        return self.inventory

    def view_book_quantity(self, title):

            self.bookManagement.add_book("book1", 2)
            self.bookManagement.add_book("book2")
            self.bookManagement.remove_book("book1", 2)

<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
