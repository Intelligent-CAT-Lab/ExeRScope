Inside the test() method, the DataStatistics class is instantiated and assigned to the ds variable.
The median() method is called on the ds object, passing in the list [2, 5, 1, 3, 4] as the data parameter.
Inside the median() method, the data parameter is sorted using the sorted() built-in function.
The sorted_data variable is assigned the sorted list.
The length of the sorted_data list is calculated and assigned to the n variable.
The n variable is checked to see if it is even or odd.
If n is even, the middle index is calculated by dividing n by 2.
The middle index is used to calculate the average of the two middle elements in the sorted_data list.
The average is rounded to two decimal places and returned.
If n is odd, the middle index is calculated by dividing n by 2.
The middle element in the sorted_data list is returned.

            return sorted_data[middle]

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Inside the test() method, the DataStatistics class is instantiated and assigned to the ds variable.
The mode() method is called on the ds object, passing in the list [2, 5, 1, 3, 4] as the data parameter.
Inside the mode() method, the Counter class is imported from the collections module.
The Counter class is used to count the occurrences of each element in the data parameter.
The most common element in the data parameter is determined using the max() built-in function.
A list comprehension is used to filter the elements in the data parameter that have the same count as the most common element.
The list comprehension creates a new list that contains the elements that have the same count as the most common element.
The list comprehension iterates over the items in the counter object and checks if the count of each element is equal to the most common count.
If the count of an element is equal to the most common count, the element is added to the new list.
The new list is returned as the mode of the data parameter.
