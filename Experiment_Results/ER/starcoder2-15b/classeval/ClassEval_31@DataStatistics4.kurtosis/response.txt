Inside the test() method, the DataStatistics4.kurtosis([1, 5, 3]) method is invoked. The purpose of this method is to calculate the kurtosis of a given list of numbers. In this case, the list is [1, 5, 3].
Inside the kurtosis() method, the n variable is set to the length of the data list, which is 3.
The mean variable is set to the mean of the data list, which is the sum of the elements divided by the length of the list.
The std_dev variable is set to the standard deviation of the data list, which is the square root of the sum of the squared differences between each element and the mean, divided by the length of the list.
The centered_data variable is set to a list of the differences between each element in the data list and the mean.
The fourth_moment variable is set to the sum of the fourth power of each element in the centered_data list, divided by the length of the list.
The kurtosis_value variable is set to the difference between the fourth_moment divided by the standard deviation to the fourth power and 3.
The method returns the kurtosis_value.

<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
