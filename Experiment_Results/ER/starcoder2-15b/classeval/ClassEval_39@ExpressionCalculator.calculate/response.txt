Inside the test() method, the calculate() method is invoked with the argument "2 * 3 * 4".
Inside the calculate() method, the transform() method is invoked with the argument "2 * 3 * 4".
Inside the transform() method, the expression is first cleaned up by removing any whitespace characters and the trailing '=' character.
The expression is then converted to a list of characters.
A for loop iterates over the characters in the expression.
Inside the loop, if the current character is a '-', it is replaced with a '~' if it is the first character or if the previous character is one of '+', '-', '*', '/', '(', 'E', or 'e'.
If the first character is a '~' and the second character is a '(', the first character is replaced with a '-' and the expression is returned as "0" + the expression.
Otherwise, the expression is returned as is.
In this case, the expression is transformed to "2*3*4".
The calculate() method then calls the prepare() method with the transformed expression.
Inside the prepare() method, a deque is created to store the postfix expression.
A deque is a double-ended queue, which is a data structure that allows elements to be added and removed from both ends.
A deque is created to store the operators in the expression.
The expression is converted to a list of characters.
A variable current_index is initialized to 0.
A variable count is initialized to 0.
A for loop iterates over the characters in the expression.
Inside the loop, if the current character is an operator, the substring from current_index to current_index + count is appended to the postfix_stack.
The count variable is reset to 0.
The current_index variable is set to i + 1.
If the current character is a ')', the while loop is entered.
Inside the while loop, the last operator in the op_stack is popped and appended to the postfix_stack.
The loop continues until the last operator in the op_stack is '('.
The '(' operator is then popped from the op_stack.
If the current character is not a ')', the while loop is entered.
Inside the while loop, the last operator in the op_stack is popped and compared to the current operator using the compare() method.
If the current operator has a higher or equal priority than the last operator in the op_stack, the current operator is appended to the op_stack.
Otherwise, the last operator in the op_stack is appended to the postfix_stack and the loop continues.
If the current character is not an operator, the count variable is incremented by 1.
After the for loop, if count is greater than 1 or if count is 1 and the last character in the expression is not an operator, the substring from current_index to current_index + count is appended to the postfix_stack.
The while loop is entered.
Inside the while loop, the last operator in the op_stack is popped and appended to the postfix_stack.
The loop continues until the last operator in the op_stack is ','.
The ',' operator is then popped from the op_stack.
The postfix_stack is reversed.
A deque is created to store the result of the calculation.
A while loop is entered.
Inside the while loop, the last element in the postfix_stack is popped and stored in current_op.
If current_op is not an operator, it is appended to the result_stack.
Otherwise, the last two elements in the result_stack are popped and stored in second_value and first_value, respectively.
The first_value and second_value are modified by replacing any '~' characters with '-'.
The _calculate() method is invoked with first_value, second_value, and current_op as arguments.
The result of the calculation is stored in temp_result.
temp_result is appended to the result_stack.
After the while loop, the result_stack is converted to a list and the elements are joined together using the '*' operator.
The resulting string is evaluated using the eval() function.
The result of the evaluation is returned.
In this case, the calculate() method returns 24.
