Inside the test() method, the TextFileProcessor class is instantiated with the file_path 'test_1.txt'.
The write_file() method is called with the content '123aac\n&^(*&43'.
The content is written to the file 'test_1.txt'.
The read_file() method is called, which reads the content of the file 'test_1.txt'.
The content is returned as a string.
<<<Output>>>
'123aac\n&^(*&43', '123aac\n&^(*&43'

<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
