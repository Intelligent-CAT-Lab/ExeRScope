Inside the test() method, a list of file names and corresponding contents are defined.
A for loop iterates over the list of file names, opening each file in write mode and writing the corresponding content to it.
A TextFileProcessor object is created, passing the first file name in the list as the file_path argument.
The read_file_as_json() method is called on the TextFileProcessor object, which reads the file as JSON and returns the parsed data.
The expected data is defined as a dictionary with the keys "name" and "age".
The type of the data returned by read_file_as_json() is checked.
The expected and actual data are returned.
<<<Output>>>
dict,dict,{'name': 'test', 'age': 12},{'name': 'test', 'age': 12}

<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
