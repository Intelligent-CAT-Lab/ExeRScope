Inside the test() method, the Statistics3() class is instantiated.
Inside the Statistics3 class, the mean() method is defined.
The mean() method takes a data parameter, which is an empty list in this case.
If the length of data is 0, the method returns None.
Otherwise, the method returns the sum of the elements in data divided by the length of data.
In this case, the data parameter is an empty list, so the sum of the elements in data is 0. The length of data is 0, so the method returns None.
<<<Output>>>
None

What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
