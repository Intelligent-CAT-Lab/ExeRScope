Inside the test() method, a ShoppingCart object is created and assigned to the shoppingcart variable.
The add_item() method is called twice on the shoppingcart object, adding two items to the cart. The first item is "apple", with a price of 1 and a quantity of 1. The second item is "banana", with a price of 2 and a quantity of 1.
The total_price() method is called on the shoppingcart object, which returns the total price of all items in the cart.
In this case, the total price is 3, which is the sum of the prices of the two items (1 + 2).

    def remove_item(self, item, quantity=1):

            self.items[item]['quantity'] -= quantity
        else:
            pass

    def view_items(self) -> dict:

    def total_price(self) -> float:
        return sum([item['quantity'] * item['price'] for item in self.items.values()])

<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The remove_item() method is called on the shoppingcart object, removing one "apple" from the cart.
The total_price() method is called on the shoppingcart object, which returns the total price of all items in the cart.
In this case, the total price is 2, which is the sum of the prices of the remaining item (2).
