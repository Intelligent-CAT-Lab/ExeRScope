Inside the test() method, a Server object is created and assigned to the server variable.
The recv() method is called on the server object with a dictionary as an argument. The dictionary contains two keys: "content" and "addr". The value of the "content" key is "abc" and the value of the "addr" key is not specified.
Inside the recv() method, the following checks are performed:
If info is not a dictionary, or if "addr" or "content" are not keys in the dictionary, the method returns -1.
The addr and content variables are assigned the values of the "addr" and "content" keys in the dictionary, respectively.
If addr is not in the white_list, the method returns False.
The receive_struct dictionary is assigned a new dictionary with the keys "addr" and "content", and the values of the addr and content variables, respectively.
The content variable is returned.
Since the "addr" key is not in the dictionary, the recv() method returns -1.
<<<Output>>>
{'addr': None, 'content': None}, -1

<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method, a Server object is created and assigned to the server variable.
The add_white_list() method is called on the server object with the argument "127.0.0.1".
Inside the add_white_list() method, the following checks are performed:
If addr is already in the white_list, the method returns False.
The addr is appended to the white_list.
The white_list is returned.
Since addr is not in the white_list, the add_white_list() method returns the white_list, which is now ["127.0.0.1"].
The recv() method is called on the server object with a dictionary as an argument. The dictionary contains two keys: "addr" and "content". The value of the "addr" key is "127.0.0.1" and the value of the "content" key is "abc".
Inside the recv() method, the following checks are performed:
If info is not a dictionary, or if "addr" or "content" are not keys in the dictionary, the method returns -1.
The addr and content variables are assigned the values of the "addr" and "content" keys in the dictionary, respectively.
If addr is not in the white_list, the method returns False.
The receive_struct dictionary is assigned a new dictionary with the keys "addr" and "content", and the values of the addr
