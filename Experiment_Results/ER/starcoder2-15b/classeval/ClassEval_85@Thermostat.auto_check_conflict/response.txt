Inside the test() method, a Thermostat object is created with the following parameters:
current_temperature = 25
target_temperature = 25
mode = 'cool'
The auto_check_conflict() method is called on the object.
Inside the auto_check_conflict() method, the current_temperature and target_temperature attributes of the object are compared. Since they are equal, the if statement is not executed.
The else statement is executed, calling the auto_set_mode() method.
Inside the auto_set_mode() method, the current_temperature and target_temperature attributes of the object are compared. Since they are equal, the if statement is not executed.
The else statement is executed, setting the mode attribute of the object to 'cool'.
The auto_check_conflict() method returns True, indicating that there is no conflict.
The test() method returns a tuple containing the return value of auto_check_conflict() and the mode attribute of the object.
<<<Output>>>
(True, 'cool')

<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Inside the test() method, a Calculator object is created with the following parameters:
a = 10
b = 5
The add(), subtract(), multiply(), and divide() methods are called on the object.
Inside the add() method, the a and b attributes of the object are added and returned.
Inside the subtract() method, the a and b attributes of the object are subtracted and returned.
Inside the multiply() method, the a and b attributes of the object are multiplied and returned.
Inside the divide() method, the a and b attributes of the object are divided and returned.
The test() method returns a tuple containing the return values of the add(), subtract(), multiply(), and divide() methods.
<<<Output>>>
