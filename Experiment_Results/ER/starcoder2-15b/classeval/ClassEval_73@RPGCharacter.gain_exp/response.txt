Inside the test() method, a new RPGCharacter object is created with the name "John", hp = 100, attack_power = 20, defense = 10, and level = 1.
The gain_exp() method is called on the character object, passing in the amount of experience points to gain, which is 400.
Inside the gain_exp() method, a while loop is used to process the experience points.
The loop continues as long as the amount of experience points to gain is not 0.
Inside the loop, if the current experience points plus the amount to gain is greater than or equal to the current level multiplied by 100, then the amount to gain is reduced by the difference between the current level multiplied by 100 and the current experience points.
The level_up() method is called, which increases the character's level, resets the experience points to 0, increases the hp by 20, increases the attack_power by 5, and increases the defense by 5.
If the current experience points plus the amount to gain is less than the current level multiplied by 100, then the experience points are increased by the amount to gain, and the amount to gain is set to 0.
After the loop completes, the method returns the character's level and experience points.

<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
