Inside the test() method, a Snake object is created with the following parameters:
SCREEN_WIDTH = 100
SCREEN_HEIGHT = 100
BLOCK_SIZE = 1
food_position = (51, 51)
The Snake object is then used to call the eat_food() method four times.
Inside the eat_food() method, the length of the snake is increased by 1, the score is increased by 100, and a new food position is generated using the random_food_position() method.
After the first call to eat_food(), the length of the snake is 2, the score is 100, and the food position is (51, 51).
After the second call to eat_food(), the length of the snake is 3, the score is 200, and the food position is (51, 51).
After the third call to eat_food(), the length of the snake is 4, the score is 300, and the food position is (51, 51).
After the fourth call to eat_food(), the length of the snake is 5, the score is 400, and the food position is (51, 51).

<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
