Inside the test() method, a URLHandler object is created with the URL "https://aaa.com/openai/human-eval".
The get_host() method is called on the URLHandler object.
Inside the get_host() method, the scheme_end variable is initialized to the index of the "://" substring in the URL.
If scheme_end is not -1, the URL is split into two parts: the scheme and the rest of the URL.
The url_without_scheme variable is initialized to the part of the URL after the "://" substring.
The host_end variable is initialized to the index of the first "/" character in the url_without_scheme.
If host_end is not -1, the host is returned as the part of the URL before the first "/" character.
If host_end is -1, the entire url_without_scheme is returned as the host.
In this case, the URL is "https://aaa.com/openai/human-eval", so the scheme_end is 5.
The url_without_scheme is "aaa.com/openai/human-eval".
The host_end is 8.
The host is returned as "aaa.com".
<<<Output>>>
aaa.com

<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
