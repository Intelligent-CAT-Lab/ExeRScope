Inside the test() method, the SQLGenerator class is instantiated with the table name 'table1'.
The insert() method is called with a dictionary of field names and values.
Inside the insert() method, the fields and values are extracted from the data dictionary.
The fields are joined with a comma and space, and the values are joined with a comma and space, and each value is enclosed in single quotes.
The sql variable is then constructed using the table name, fields, and values.
The sql variable is returned, with a semicolon appended to it.
<<<Output>>>
INSERT INTO table1 (field1, field2, field3, field4, field5) VALUES ('value1', 'value2', 'value3', 'value4', 'value5');

<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method, the SQLGenerator class is instantiated with the table name 'table1'.
The select_female_under_age() method is called with an age of 20.
Inside the select_female_under_age() method, the condition variable is constructed using the age and gender.
The select() method is called with the condition as an argument.
Inside the select() method, the sql variable is constructed using the table name, fields, and condition.
The sql variable is returned, with a semicolon appended to it.
<<<Output>>>
SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE age < 20 AND gender = 'female';
