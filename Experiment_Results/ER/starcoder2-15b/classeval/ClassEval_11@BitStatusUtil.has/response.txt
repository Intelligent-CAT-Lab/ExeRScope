Inside the test() method, the BitStatusUtil() class is instantiated. This creates an instance of the BitStatusUtil class, which is assigned to the variable bit_status_util.
The has() method is then called on the bit_status_util instance, passing in the arguments 6 and 4.
Inside the has() method, the check() method is called, passing in a list containing the arguments states and stat.
Inside the check() method, a for loop iterates over the elements in the args list. For each element, the following checks are performed:
If the element is less than 0, a ValueError is raised with the message "{arg} must be greater than or equal to 0".
If the element is not even, a ValueError is raised with the message "{arg} not even".
After the loop completes, the method returns None.
The has() method then continues.
The states and stat variables are assigned the values 6 and 4, respectively.
The has() method then returns the result of the expression (states & stat) == stat.
The & operator performs a bitwise AND operation on the states and stat variables. This returns a new integer that contains only the bits that are set in both states and stat.
The == operator checks if the result of the bitwise AND operation is equal to stat.
Since 6 & 4 is 4, and 4 == 4, the has() method returns True.

True

Consider the following code:

import unittest
class BitStatusUtil:
    @staticmethod
    def add(states, stat):
        BitStatusUtil.check([states, stat])
        return states | stat

    @staticmethod
    def has(states, stat):
        BitStatusUtil.check([states, stat])
        return (states & stat) == stat

    @staticmethod
    def remove(states, stat):
        BitStatusUtil.check([states, stat])
        if BitStatusUtil.has(states, stat):
            return states ^ stat
        return states

    @staticmethod
    def check(args):
        for arg in args:
            if arg < 0:
                raise ValueError(f"{arg} must be greater than or equal to 0")
            if arg % 2 != 0:
                raise ValueError(f"{arg} not even")
class Test(unittest.TestCase):
    def test(self):
            bit_status_util = BitStatusUtil()
            return bit_status_util.remove(6, 4)

What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
