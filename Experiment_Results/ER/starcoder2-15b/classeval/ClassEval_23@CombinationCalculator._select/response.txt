Inside the test() method, a CombinationCalculator object is created with the list ["A", "B", "C", "D"] as the input.
The _select() method is then called with the following arguments:
dataIndex: 0
resultList: [None] * 0
resultIndex: 0
result: []
Inside the _select() method, the resultLen variable is set to the length of the resultList, which is 0.
The resultCount variable is set to the resultIndex + 1, which is 1.
The if statement checks if resultCount is greater than resultLen, which is not the case.
The for loop iterates over the range from dataIndex to len(self.datas) + resultCount - resultLen, which is 4.
The resultList[resultIndex] is set to self.datas[i], which is "A".
The _select() method is called recursively with the following arguments:
dataIndex: i + 1, which is 1
resultList: resultList, which is [None]
resultIndex: resultIndex + 1, which is 1
result: result, which is []
Inside the _select() method, the resultLen variable is set to the length of the resultList, which is 1.
The resultCount variable is set to the resultIndex + 1, which is 2.
The if statement checks if resultCount is greater than resultLen, which is not the case.
The for loop iterates over the range from dataIndex to len(self.datas) + resultCount - resultLen, which is 3.
The resultList[resultIndex] is set to self.datas[i], which is "B".
The _select() method is called recursively with the following arguments:
dataIndex: i + 1, which is 2
resultList: resultList, which is [None, "B"]
resultIndex: resultIndex + 1, which is 2
result: result, which is []
Inside the _select() method, the resultLen variable is set to the length of the resultList, which is 2.
The resultCount variable is set to the resultIndex + 1, which is 3.
The if statement checks if resultCount is greater than resultLen, which is not the case.
The for loop iterates over the range from dataIndex to len(self.datas) + resultCount - resultLen, which is 2.
The resultList[resultIndex] is set to self.datas[i], which is "C".
The _select() method is called recursively with the following arguments:
dataIndex: i + 1, which is 3
resultList: resultList, which is [None, "B", "C"]
resultIndex: resultIndex + 1, which is 3
result: result, which is []
Inside the _select() method, the resultLen variable is set to the length of the resultList, which is 3.
The resultCount variable is set to the resultIndex + 1, which is 4.
The if statement checks if resultCount is greater than resultLen, which is not the case.
The for loop iterates over the range from dataIndex to len(self.datas) + resultCount - resultLen, which is 1.
The resultList[resultIndex] is set to self.datas[i], which is "D".
The _select() method is called recursively with the following arguments:
dataIndex: i + 1, which is 4
resultList: resultList, which is [None, "B", "C", "D"]
resultIndex: resultIndex + 1, which is 4
result: result, which is []
Inside the _select() method, the resultLen variable is set to the length of the resultList, which is 4.
The resultCount variable is set to the resultIndex + 1, which is 5.
The if statement checks if resultCount is greater than resultLen, which is not the case.
The for loop iterates over the range from dataIndex to len(self.datas) + resultCount - resultLen, which is 0.
The resultList[resultIndex] is set to self.datas[i], which is None.
The _select() method is called recursively with the following arguments:
dataIndex: i + 1, which is 5
resultList: resultList, which is [None, "B", "C", "D", None]
resultIndex: resultIndex + 1, which is 5
result: result, which is []
Inside the _select() method, the resultLen variable is set to the length of the resultList, which
