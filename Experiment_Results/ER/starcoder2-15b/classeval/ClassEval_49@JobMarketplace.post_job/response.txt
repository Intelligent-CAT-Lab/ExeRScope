Inside the test() method, a JobMarketplace object is created and assigned to the jobMarketplace variable.
The post_job() method is called three times on the jobMarketplace object, passing in different job titles, companies, and requirements.
The first call to post_job() passes in "Software Engineer" as the job title, "ABC Company" as the company, and a list of two requirements as the requirements.
The second call to post_job() passes in "Mechanical Engineer" as the job title, "XYZ Company" as the company, and a list of two requirements as the requirements.
The third call to post_job() passes in "Software Engineer" as the job title, "ABC Company" as the company, and a list of two requirements as the requirements.
After the three calls to post_job(), the job_listings attribute of the jobMarketplace object is returned.
<<<Output>>>
[{'job_title': 'Software Engineer', 'company': 'ABC Company', 'requirements': ['requirement1', 'requirement2']}, {'job_title': 'Mechanical Engineer', 'company': 'XYZ Company', 'requirements': ['requirement3', 'requirement4']}, {'job_title': 'Software Engineer', 'company': 'ABC Company', 'requirements': ['requirement1', 'requirement2']}]
