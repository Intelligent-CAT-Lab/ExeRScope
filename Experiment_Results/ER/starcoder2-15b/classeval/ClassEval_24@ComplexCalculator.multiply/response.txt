Inside the test() method, the ComplexCalculator class is instantiated and assigned to the complexCalculator variable.
The multiply() method is called on the complexCalculator object, passing in two complex numbers as arguments.
The first complex number is (1 + 2j), and the second is (3 + 4j).
Inside the multiply() method, the real and imaginary parts of the result are calculated using the formula for complex multiplication.
The real part is calculated as:
real = c1.real * c2.real - c1.imag * c2.imag
The imaginary part is calculated as:
imaginary = c1.real * c2.imag + c1.imag * c2.real
In this case, c1 is (1 + 2j), and c2 is (3 + 4j).
Substituting the values of c1 and c2 into the formula, we get:
real = 1 * 3 - 2 * 4 = -5
imaginary = 1 * 4 + 2 * 3 = 10
The multiply() method returns a complex number with real part -5 and imaginary part 10.
<<<Output>>>
(-5+10j)

What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Inside the test() method, the Calculator class is instantiated and assigned to the calculator variable.
The multiply() method is called on the calculator object, passing in two numbers as arguments.
The first number is 2, and the second is 3.
Inside the multiply() method, the product of the two numbers is calculated and returned.
In this case, the product is 2 * 3 = 6.
