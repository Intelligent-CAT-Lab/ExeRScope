Inside the test() method, the BookManagementDB class is instantiated with the database name "test.db".
The connection to the database is established using the sqlite3 module.
A book is added to the database using the add_book() method. The title of the book is "Book to Borrow" and the author is "".
The borrow_book() method is called with the book ID of 1, which is the ID of the book that was just added.
The borrow_book() method updates the available column of the books table to 0 for the book with the given ID.
The cursor is used to execute a SQL query to select the available column of the books table where the ID is 1.
The fetchone() method is called on the cursor to retrieve the first row of the result set.
The available column of the first row is returned as the result of the test() method.

Consider the following code:

import unittest

class Calculator:
    def __init__(self, a, b):
        self.a = a
        self.b = b

    def add(self):
        return self.a + self.b

    def subtract(self):
        return self.a - self.b

    def multiply(self):
        return self.a * self.b

    def divide(self):
        return self.a / self.b
class Test(unittest.TestCase):
    def test(self):
            calculator = Calculator(10, 5)
            result = calculator.add()
            return result
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method, a Calculator object is instantiated with the values 10 and 5.
The add() method is called on the calculator object, which returns the sum of the a and b attributes of the calculator object.
In this case, the a attribute is 10 and the b attribute is 5, so the add() method returns 15.
The result of the add() method is returned as the result of the test() method.
<<<Output>>>
15

The subtract() method is called on the calculator object, which returns the difference of the a and b attributes of the calculator object.
In this case, the a attribute is 10 and the b attribute is 5, so the subtract() method returns 5.
The result of the subtract() method is returned as the result of the test() method.
