Inside the test() method, the ClassRegistrationSystem class is instantiated and assigned to the self.registration_system variable.
The students attribute of the self.registration_system object is assigned a list of dictionaries, each representing a student with their name and major.
The get_students_by_major() method is called twice, once with the argument "Computer Science" and once with the argument "Mathematics".
Inside the get_students_by_major() method, a student_list variable is initialized to an empty list.
A for loop iterates over the self.students attribute of the self.registration_system object.
Inside the loop, if the student's major matches the major argument passed to the method, the student's name is appended to the student_list.
After the loop completes, the student_list is returned.

What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
