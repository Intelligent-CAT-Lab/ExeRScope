Inside the test() method, the get_all_major() method is invoked.
The purpose of this method is to return a list of all the majors in the registration system.
Inside the get_all_major() method, the major_list variable is initialized to an empty list.
A for loop iterates over each student in the self.students list.
Inside the loop, if the student's major is not already in the major_list, it is added to the list.
After the loop completes, the method returns the major_list, which contains all the unique majors in the registration system.

What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method, the get_most_popular_class_in_major() method is invoked with the argument "Computer Science".
The purpose of this method is to return the most popular class among students in the given major.
Inside the get_most_popular_class_in_major() method, the class_list variable is initialized to an empty list.
A for loop iterates over each student in the self.students list.
Inside the loop, if the student's major matches the given major, the student's registered classes are added to the class_list.
After the loop completes, the class_list contains all the classes registered by students in the given major.
The max() function is used to find the most popular class in the class_list. It takes two arguments:
set(class_list): This creates a set of unique classes in the class_list.
key=class_list.count: This specifies that the most popular class should be determined based on the number of occurrences of each class in the class_list.
After the max() function is
