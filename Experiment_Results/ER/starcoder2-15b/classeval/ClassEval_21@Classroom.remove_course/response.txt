Inside the test() method, a Classroom object is created with an id of 1.
A course dictionary is created with a name of 'Art', a start_time of '14:00', and an end_time of '15:00'.
The add_course() method is called on the classroom object, passing in the course dictionary.
The remove_course() method is called on the classroom object, passing in the course dictionary.
The course dictionary is returned, along with an empty list of courses in the classroom object.
<<<Output>>>
({'name': 'Art', 'start_time': '14:00', 'end_time': '15:00'}, [])

class Calculator:
    def __init__(self, a, b):
        self.a = a
        self.b = b

    def add(self):
        return self.a + self.b

    def subtract(self):
        return self.a - self.b

    def multiply(self):
        return self.a * self.b

    def divide(self):
        return self.a / self.b
class Test(unittest.TestCase):
    def test(self):
            calculator = Calculator(10, 5)
            return calculator.add(),calculator.subtract(),calculator.multiply(),calculator.divide()
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method, a Calculator object is created with a and b set to 10 and 5, respectively.
The add() method is called on the calculator object, and the result is returned.
The subtract() method is called on the calculator object, and the result is returned.
The multiply() method is called on the calculator object, and the result is returned.
The divide() method is called on the calculator object, and the result is returned.
