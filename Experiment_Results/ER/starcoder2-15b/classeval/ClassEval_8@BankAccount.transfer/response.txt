Inside the test() method, two BankAccount objects are created: account1 and account2.
The balance of account1 is set to 500, and the balance of account2 is set to 1000.
The transfer() method is called on account1, passing account2 and 500 as arguments.
Inside the transfer() method, the withdraw() method is called on account1, passing 500 as an argument.
Inside the withdraw() method, the balance of account1 is decreased by 500.
The deposit() method is called on account2, passing 500 as an argument.
Inside the deposit() method, the balance of account2 is increased by 500.
After the transfer() method completes, the view_balance() method is called on both account1 and account2.
The balance of account1 is returned as 0, and the balance of account2 is returned as 1500.
<<<Output>>>
(0, 1500)

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import unittest
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, balance=0):
        self.balance = balance

    def deposit(self, amount):
        if amount < 0:
            raise ValueError("Invalid amount")
        self.balance += amount
        return self.balance

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        if amount < 0:
            raise ValueError("Invalid amount")
        if amount > self.balance:
            raise ValueError("Insufficient balance.")
        self.balance -= amount
        return self.balance

    def view_balance(self):
        return self.balance

    def transfer(self, other_account, amount):
        self.withdraw(amount)
        other_account.deposit(amount)
class Test(unittest.TestCase):
    def test(self):
            account1 = BankAccount()
            account2 = BankAccount()
            account1.balance = 500
            account2.balance = 1000
            account1.transfer(account2, 500)
            return account1.view_balance(),account2.view_balance()

<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
