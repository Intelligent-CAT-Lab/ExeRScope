Inside the test() method, the MovieBookingSystem class is instantiated and assigned to the self.system variable.
The add_movie() method is called on the self.system object, passing in the following arguments:
name: 'Batman'
price: 49.9
start_time: '17:05'
end_time: '19:25'
n: 3
The add_movie() method adds a new movie to the self.system object's movies list. The movie dictionary contains the following keys and values:
name: 'Batman'
price: 49.9
start_time: datetime object representing 17:05
end_time: datetime object representing 19:25
seats: a 3x3 numpy array of zeros
The book_ticket() method is called on the self.system object, passing in the following arguments:
name: 'Batman'
seats_to_book: [(0, 0)]
The book_ticket() method attempts to book a ticket for the 'Batman' movie at seat (0, 0).
The for loop iterates over the self.system.movies list, searching for a movie with the name 'Batman'.
When the movie is found, the for loop iterates over the seats_to_book list, which contains a single seat tuple: (0, 0).
The if statement checks if the seat at (0, 0) is available (i.e., if it is equal to 0).
Since the seat is available, it is booked by setting the value at (0, 0) to 1.
The return statement returns the string "Booking success."
The book_ticket() method is called again, passing in the same arguments as before.
The for loop iterates over the self.system.movies list, searching for a movie with the name 'Batman'.
When the movie is found, the for loop iterates over the seats_to_book list, which contains a single seat tuple: (0, 0).
The if statement checks if the seat at (0, 0) is available (i.e., if it is equal to 1).
Since the seat is already booked, the return statement returns the string "Booking failed."
The return statement returns the string "Booking failed." and the value of the first seat in the 'Batman' movie's seats array.
<<<Output>>>
Booking failed.,1.0

<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method, a LinkedList object is instantiated and assigned to the llist variable.
The insert() method is called on the llist object, passing in the following arguments:
data: 1
The insert() method creates a new Node object with the data 1 and inserts it into the linked list.
The insert() method is called again, passing in the following arguments:
data: 2
The insert() method creates a new Node object with the data 2 and inserts it into the linked list.
The insert() method is called again, passing in
