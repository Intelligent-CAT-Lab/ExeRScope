Inside the test() method, a BookManagement object is created and assigned to the bookManagement variable.
The add_book() method is called twice on the bookManagement object. The first call adds "book1" to the inventory dictionary with a quantity of 2. The second call adds "book1" to the inventory dictionary with a quantity of 1.
The inventory dictionary is returned as the result of the test() method.
<<<Output>>>
{'book1': 3}

<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
