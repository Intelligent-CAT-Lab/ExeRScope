Inside the test() method, the Lemmatization class is instantiated.
The remove_punctuation() method is called with the argument "Is this a test? I hope it is...".
Inside the remove_punctuation() method, the sentence is first translated using the translate() method. The maketrans() method is used to create a translation table that maps all punctuation characters to the empty string.
The translate() method then replaces all punctuation characters in the sentence with the empty string, effectively removing them.
The resulting sentence is returned.

<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method, the Lemmatization class is instantiated.
The get_pos_tag() method is called with the argument "Is this a test? I hope it is...".
Inside the get_pos_tag() method, the remove_punctuation() method is called with the same argument.
Inside the remove_punctuation() method, the sentence is first translated using the translate() method. The maketrans() method is used to create a translation table that maps all punctuation characters to the empty string.
The translate() method then replaces all punctuation characters in the sentence with the empty string, effectively removing them.
The resulting sentence is then tokenized using the word_tokenize() method.
The pos_tag() method is then called on the tokenized sentence, which returns a list of tuples containing the words and their corresponding part-of-speech tags.
The for loop iterates over the tagged_words list, and for each tagged_word, the pos_tag is appended to the pos_tags list.
The pos_tags list is then returned.
