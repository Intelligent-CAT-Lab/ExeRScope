Inside the test() method, a UrlPath object is created and assigned to the url_path variable.
The add() method is called on the url_path object, passing the string '123' as the argument.
Inside the add() method, the fix_path() method is called with the argument '123'.
Inside the fix_path() method, the path parameter is checked for a falsy value. Since '123' is a non-empty string, the if statement is not executed.
The path parameter is then stripped of leading and trailing slashes using the strip() method. The '/' character is passed as the argument to the strip() method.
The stripped path is then returned.
The add() method appends the returned value to the segments list of the url_path object.
The segments list is initialized to an empty list in the __init__() method.
The add() method appends the fixed path to the segments list.
The fixed path is '123' in this case.
After the add() method completes, the segments list of the url_path object contains the string '123'.
The test() method returns the segments list of the url_path object.
<<<Output>>>
['123']

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import unittest
import re


class Regex:
    def __init__(self, pattern):
        self.pattern = pattern

    def match(self, text):
        return re.match(self.pattern, text)

    def search(self, text):
        return re.search(self.pattern, text)

    def findall(self, text):
        return re.findall(self.pattern, text)

    def split(self, text):
        return re.split(self.pattern, text)

    def sub(self, repl, text):
        return re.sub(self.pattern, repl, text)
class Test(unittest.TestCase):
    def test(self):
            regex = Regex(r'(\d{4})-(\d{2})-(\d{2})')
            return regex.findall('2022-01-01')

What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method, a Regex object is created and assigned to the regex variable.
The Regex object is initialized with the pattern r'(\d{4})-(\d{2})-(\d{2})'.
The findall() method is called on the regex object, passing the string '2022-01-01' as the argument.
Inside the findall() method, the re.findall() function is called with the pattern and text as arguments.
The pattern is the regular expression r'(\d{4})-(\d{2})-(\d{2})', which matches a date in the format YYYY-MM-DD.
The text is the string '2022-01-01'.
The re.findall() function returns a list of all non-overlapping matches of the pattern in the text.
In this case, the pattern matches the entire string '2022-01-01', so the list returned by re.findall() contains a single element: ['2022-01-01'].
The test() method returns the list returned by the findall() method.
<<<Output>>>
['2022-01-01']
