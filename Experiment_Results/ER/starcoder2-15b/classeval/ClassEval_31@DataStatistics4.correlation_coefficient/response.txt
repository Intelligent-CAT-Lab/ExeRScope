Inside the test() method, the DataStatistics4.correlation_coefficient() method is invoked with the arguments [1, 2, 3] and [1, 2, 4].
Inside the correlation_coefficient() method, the following variables are defined:
n: The length of data1, which is 3.
mean1: The mean of data1, which is 2.
mean2: The mean of data2, which is 2.5.
numerator: The sum of the product of (data1[i] - mean1) and (data2[i] - mean2) for each i in the range from 0 to n-1.
denominator: The square root of the product of the sum of (data1[i] - mean1) ** 2 for each i in the range from 0 to n-1 and the sum of (data2[i] - mean2) ** 2 for each i in the range from 0 to n-1.
The correlation_coefficient() method returns numerator / denominator if denominator is not equal to 0, otherwise it returns 0.

<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
