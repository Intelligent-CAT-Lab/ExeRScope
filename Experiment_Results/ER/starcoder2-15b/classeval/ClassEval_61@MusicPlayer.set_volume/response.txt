Inside the test() method, the MusicPlayer class is instantiated and assigned to the musicPlayer variable.
The set_volume() method is called on the musicPlayer object, passing in the value 100 as the argument.
Inside the set_volume() method, the volume attribute of the musicPlayer object is set to the value passed in as the argument.
The return statement returns the value of the volume attribute, which is 100.
<<<Output>>>
(True, 100)

<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
