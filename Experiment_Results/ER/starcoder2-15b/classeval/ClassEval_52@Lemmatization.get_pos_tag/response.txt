Inside the test() method, the Lemmatization class is instantiated.
The lemmatize_sentence() method is called with the input sentence "The dog's barked at the mailman.".
Inside the lemmatize_sentence() method, the remove_punctuation() method is called with the input sentence.
Inside the remove_punctuation() method, the translate() method is called with the input sentence and a translation table.
The translation table is created using the maketrans() method, which takes three arguments: two strings of equal length and a third string.
The first string contains the characters to be replaced, the second string contains the replacement characters, and the third string contains the characters to be deleted.
In this case, the first string contains all the punctuation characters, the second string is empty, and the third string is also empty.
This means that all the punctuation characters in the input sentence will be replaced with empty strings, effectively removing them.
The resulting sentence is returned by the remove_punctuation() method.
The lemmatize_sentence() method then tokenizes the sentence using the word_tokenize() method from the nltk library.
The tokenized words are then tagged using the pos_tag() method from the nltk library.
For each word in the sentence, the lemmatize_sentence() method checks the part-of-speech tag of the word using the tag.startswith() method.
If the tag starts with 'V', 'J', or 'R', the word is lemmatized using the lemmatize() method from the WordNetLemmatizer class.
The lemmatized word is appended to the lemmatized_words list.
If the tag does not start with 'V', 'J', or 'R', the word is lemmatized using the lemmatize() method from the WordNetLemmatizer class without specifying the part-of-speech tag.
The lemmatized word is appended to the lemmatized_words list.
The lemmatized_words list is returned by the lemmatize_sentence() method.
The get_pos_tag() method is called with the input sentence "The dog's barked at the mailman.".
Inside the get_pos_tag() method, the remove_punctuation() method is called with the input sentence.
The remove_punctuation() method removes the punctuation from the input sentence and returns the resulting sentence.
The get_pos_tag() method then tokenizes the sentence using the word_tokenize() method from the nltk library.
The tokenized words are then tagged using the pos_tag() method from the nltk library.
For each word in the sentence, the get_pos_tag() method extracts the part-of-speech tag of the word using the tag[1] indexing.
The part-of-speech tag is appended to the pos_tags list.
The pos_tags list is returned by the get_pos_tag() method.
The test() method then returns the result of the get_pos_tag() method, which is a list of part-of-speech tags for the input sentence.
