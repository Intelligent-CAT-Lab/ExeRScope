Inside the test() method, the SQLGenerator class is instantiated with the table name 'table1'.
The update() method is called on the instance of SQLGenerator, passing in two arguments: a dictionary and a string.
The dictionary contains the fields and their corresponding values to be updated.
The string is the condition for the update statement.
Inside the update() method, the set_clause variable is created by joining the keys and values of the dictionary using a comma and an equal sign.
The sql variable is created by concatenating the table name, the set_clause, and the condition.
The sql variable is returned, with a semicolon appended to it.
<<<Output>>>
UPDATE table1 SET field1 = 'new_value1', field2 = 'new_value2', field3 = 'new_value3', field4 = 'new_value4' WHERE field5 = value1;

<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method, the SQLGenerator class is instantiated with the table name 'table1'.
The select_female_under_age() method is called on the instance of SQLGenerator, passing in an argument of 20.
Inside the select_female_under_age() method, the condition variable is created by concatenating the string 'age < ' with the age argument (which is 20 in this case) and the string ' AND gender = 'female'.
The select() method is called on the instance of SQLGenerator, passing in the condition variable as the condition argument.
Inside the select() method, the sql variable is created by concatenating the table name, the condition, and a semicolon.
The sql variable is returned.
<<<Output>>>
SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE age < 20 AND gender = 'female';
