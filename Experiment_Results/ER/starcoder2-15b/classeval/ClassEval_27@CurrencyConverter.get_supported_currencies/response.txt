Inside the test() method, the CurrencyConverter class is instantiated.
The CurrencyConverter class has a constructor that initializes the rates dictionary with the exchange rates for various currencies.
The get_supported_currencies() method is called on the cc object.
Inside the get_supported_currencies() method, the keys() method is called on the rates dictionary, which returns a list of the keys in the dictionary.
The list of keys is returned from the method.

<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method, the CurrencyConverter class is instantiated.
The CurrencyConverter class has a constructor that initializes the rates dictionary with the exchange rates for various currencies.
The convert() method is called on the cc object, passing in the amount 100, the from_currency 'USD', and the to_currency 'EUR'.
Inside the convert() method, the from_currency and to_currency are checked to see if they are the same. Since they are not, the code continues.
The from_currency and to_currency are checked to see if they are in the rates dictionary. Since they are, the code continues.
The from_rate and to_rate are retrieved from the rates dictionary using the from_currency and to_currency as keys.
The converted_amount is calculated by dividing the amount by the from_rate and multiplying it by the to_rate.
The converted_amount is returned from the method.
