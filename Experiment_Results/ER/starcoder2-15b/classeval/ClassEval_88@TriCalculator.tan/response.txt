Inside the test() method, the TriCalculator() class is instantiated and assigned to the tricalculator variable.
The tricalculator.tan(60) method is invoked, passing 60 as an argument.
Inside the tan() method, the sin() and cos() methods are invoked, passing 60 as an argument.
Inside the sin() method, the x variable is set to 60 / 180 * pi, which is approximately 0.10471975511965977.
The g variable is initialized to 0.
The t variable is set to x, which is 0.10471975511965977.
The n variable is set to 1.
The fabs() function is used to get the absolute value of t, which is 0.10471975511965977.
The while loop is entered because fabs(t) is greater than or equal to 1e-15, which is 1.0 * 10^-15.
Inside the loop, g is incremented by t, which is 0.10471975511965977.
The n variable is incremented by 1, which makes n equal to 2.
The t variable is set to -t * x * x / (2 * n - 1) / (2 * n - 2), which is approximately -0.00017453292519943295.
The loop is exited because fabs(t) is less than 1e-15, which is 1.0 * 10^-15.
The g variable is returned, which is approximately 0.10471975511965977.
Inside the cos() method, the taylor() method is invoked, passing 60 and 50 as arguments.
Inside the taylor() method, the x variable is set to 60 / 180 * pi, which is approximately 0.10471975511965977.
The a variable is initialized to 1.
The count variable is initialized to 1.
The for loop iterates from 1 to 50 (which is the value of n), incrementing k each time.
Inside the loop, if count is odd, a is decremented by (x ** (2 * k)) / self.factorial(2 * k), which is approximately 0.00017453292519943295.
Otherwise, a is incremented by (x ** (2 * k)) / self.factorial(2 * k), which is approximately 0.00017453292519943295.
The count variable is incremented by 1.
After the loop completes, a is returned, which is approximately 0.9998254670748005.
Inside the tan() method, if self.cos(x) is not equal to 0, the result variable is set to self.sin(x) / self.cos(x), which is approximately 0.10471975511965977.
The result variable is returned, which is approximately 0.10471975511965977.
