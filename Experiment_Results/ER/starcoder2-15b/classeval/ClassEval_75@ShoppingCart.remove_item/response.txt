Inside the test() method, a ShoppingCart object is created and assigned to the shoppingcart variable.
The add_item() method is called on the shoppingcart object, passing in the string "apple", the integer 1, and the integer 5 as arguments.
The remove_item() method is called on the shoppingcart object, passing in the string "banana" and the integer 4 as arguments.
The view_items() method is called on the shoppingcart object, and the return value is assigned to the items variable.
The total_price() method is called on the shoppingcart object, and the return value is assigned to the total_price variable.
<<<Output>>>
{'apple': {'price': 1, 'quantity': 5}}

Consider the following code:

import unittest
class ShoppingCart:
    def __init__(self):
        self.items = {}

    def add_item(self, item, price, quantity=1):

        else:
            self.items[item] = {'price': price, 'quantity': quantity}

    def remove_item(self, item, quantity=1):
        if item in self.items:
            self.items[item]['quantity'] -= quantity
        else:
            pass

    def view_items(self) -> dict:
        return self.items

    def total_price(self) -> float:
        return sum([item['quantity'] * item['price'] for item in self.items.values()])
class Test(unittest.TestCase):
    def test(self):
            shoppingcart = ShoppingCart()
            shoppingcart.add_item("apple", 1, 5)
            shoppingcart.remove_item("banana", 4)
            return shoppingcart.total_price()
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
