Inside the test() method, the BitStatusUtil() class is instantiated. This creates an instance of the BitStatusUtil class, which is assigned to the variable bit_status_util.
The remove() method is then called on the bit_status_util instance, passing in the arguments 6 and 2.
Inside the remove() method, the check() method is called, passing in a list containing the arguments states and stat.
Inside the check() method, a for loop iterates over the elements in the args list. For each element, the following checks are performed:
If the element is less than 0, a ValueError is raised with the message "{arg} must be greater than or equal to 0".
If the element is not even, a ValueError is raised with the message "{arg} not even".
After the loop completes, the method returns None.
The remove() method then continues. It checks if the result of calling the has() method on the bit_status_util instance with the arguments states and stat is equal to stat.
Inside the has() method, the check() method is called, passing in a list containing the arguments states and stat.
Inside the check() method, a for loop iterates over the elements in the args list. For each element, the following checks are performed:
If the element is less than 0, a ValueError is raised with the message "{arg} must be greater than or equal to 0".
If the element is not even, a ValueError is raised with the message "{arg} not even".
After the loop completes, the method returns None.
The has() method then continues. It checks if the result of calling the & (bitwise AND) operator on states and stat is equal to stat.
Inside the & operator, the bits of states and stat are compared, and the result is a new integer with the bits set to 1 where both states and stat have a 1 bit.
The has() method then returns the result of the comparison.
The remove() method then continues. If the result of the has() method is equal to stat, the result of calling the ^ (bitwise XOR) operator on states and stat is returned.
Inside the ^ operator, the bits of states and stat are compared, and the result is a new integer with the bits set to 1 where states and stat have different bits.
The remove() method then returns the result of the comparison.
If the result of the has() method is not equal to stat, states is returned.

Consider the following code:

        BitStatusUtil.check([states, stat])

        return (states & stat) == stat

    @staticmethod
    def remove(states, stat):
        BitStatusUtil.check([states, stat])
        if BitStatusUtil.has(states, stat):
            return states ^ stat
        return states

    @staticmethod
    def check(args):
        for arg in args:
            if arg < 0:
                raise ValueError(f"{arg} must be greater than or equal to 0")
            if arg % 2 != 0:
                raise ValueError(f"{arg} not even")
class Test(unittest.TestCase):

            bit_status_util = BitStatusUtil()
            return bit_status_util.has(6, 2)

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
