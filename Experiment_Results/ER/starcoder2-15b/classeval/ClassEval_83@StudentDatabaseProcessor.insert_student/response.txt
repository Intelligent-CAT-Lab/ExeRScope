Inside the test() method, the StudentDatabaseProcessor class is instantiated with the database name "test_database.db".
The create_student_table() method is called, which creates a table named "students" in the database if it does not already exist.
A dictionary student_data is defined, containing the name, age, gender, and grade of a student.
The insert_student() method is called, passing in the student_data dictionary. This inserts a new student record into the "students" table in the database.
The search_student_by_name() method is called, passing in the name "Bob". This searches for a student record in the "students" table with the name "Bob".
The delete_student_by_name() method is called, passing in the name "Bob". This deletes the student record from the "students" table with the name "Bob".

<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
