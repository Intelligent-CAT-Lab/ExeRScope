Inside the test() method, a Calculator object is created and assigned to the calculator variable.
The calculate() method is called on the calculator object, passing in the string '1+2*3' as an argument.
Inside the calculate() method, the expression argument is iterated over, and each character is processed according to the following rules:
If the character is a digit or a decimal point (.), the num_buffer variable is appended with the character.
If the character is an operator (+, -, *, /, or ^), the num_buffer variable is converted to a float and appended to the operand_stack. The num_buffer variable is then reset to an empty string.
The operator is then pushed onto the operator_stack.
If the character is an opening parenthesis (,), the operator is pushed onto the operator_stack.
If the character is a closing parenthesis ), the operator_stack is popped until the opening parenthesis ( is found.
If the num_buffer variable is not empty, the float value of num_buffer is appended to the operand_stack.
While the operator_stack is not empty, the apply_operator() method is called to apply the operator at the top of the stack to the operands at the top of the operand_stack.
The result of the operation is pushed onto the operand_stack.
Finally, the last operand in the operand_stack is returned as the result of the calculate() method.

<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
