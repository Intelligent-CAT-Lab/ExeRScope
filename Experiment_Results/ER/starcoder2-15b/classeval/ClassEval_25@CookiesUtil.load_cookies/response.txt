Inside the test() method, the CookiesUtil class is instantiated with the cookies_file parameter set to 'cookies.json'.
The cookies_util.cookies attribute is set to a dictionary with two key-value pairs: 'key1' and 'value1', and 'key2' and 'value2'.
The load_cookies() method is called on the cookies_util object.
Inside the load_cookies() method, a try-except block is used to handle the case where the cookies_file file does not exist.
If the file does not exist, an empty dictionary is returned.
If the file exists, the contents of the file are read and parsed using the json.load() function.
The contents of the file are returned as a dictionary.
<<<Output>>>
{'cookies': {'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2'}}

What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
