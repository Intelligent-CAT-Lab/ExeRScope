Inside the test() method, a Server object is created and assigned to the server variable.
The add_white_list() method is called on the server object, passing the integer 66 as an argument.
The send() method is called on the server object, passing a dictionary as an argument. The dictionary has two keys: "addr" and "content". The value of "addr" is 22, and the value of "content" is "abc".
The recv() method is called on the server object, passing a dictionary as an argument. The dictionary has two keys: "addr" and "content". The value of "addr" is 66, and the value of "content" is "ABC".
The show() method is called on the server object, passing the string "send" as an argument.
Inside the add_white_list() method, the addr argument is checked to see if it is already in the white_list list. If it is, False is returned. Otherwise, addr is added to the white_list list and the updated white_list is returned.
Inside the del_white_list() method, the addr argument is checked to see if it is in the white_list list. If it is not, False is returned. Otherwise, addr is removed from the white_list list and the updated white_list is returned.
Inside the recv() method, the info argument is checked to see if it is a dictionary and if it contains the keys "addr" and "content". If it does not, -1 is returned. Otherwise, the values of "addr" and "content" are extracted and assigned to the addr and content variables, respectively.
The addr variable is then checked to see if it is in the white_list list. If it is not, False is returned. Otherwise, the addr and content values are assigned to the "addr" and "content" keys of the receive_struct dictionary, respectively, and the content value is returned.
Inside the send() method, the info argument is checked to see if it is a dictionary and if it contains the keys "addr" and "content". If it does not, the string "info structure is not correct" is returned. Otherwise, the values of "addr" and "content" are extracted and assigned to the "addr" and "content" keys of the send_struct dictionary, respectively.
Inside the show() method, the type argument is checked to see if it is equal to "send". If it is, the send_struct dictionary is returned. Otherwise, if type is equal to "receive", the receive_struct dictionary is returned. Otherwise, False is returned.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import unittest

            self.white_list.append(addr)
            return self.white_list

    def del_white_list(self, addr):
        if addr not in self.white_list:
            return False
        else:
            self.white_list.remove(addr)
            return self.white_list

    def recv(self, info):
        if not isinstance(info, dict) or "addr" not in info or "content" not in info:
            return -1
        addr = info["addr"]
        content = info["content"]
        if addr not in self.white_list:
            return False
        else:
            self.receive_struct = {"addr": addr, "content": content}
            return self.receive_struct["content"]

    def send(self, info):

            return "info structure is not correct"
        self.send_struct = {"addr": info["addr"], "content": info["content"]}

    def show(self, type):
        if type == "send":
            return self.send_struct
        elif type == "receive":
            return self.receive_struct
        else:
            return False
class Test(unittest.TestCase):
    def test(self):
            server = Server()
            server.add_white_list(66)
            server.send({"addr": 22, "content": "abc"})
            server.recv({"addr": 66, "content": "ABC"})
            return server.show('receive')
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
