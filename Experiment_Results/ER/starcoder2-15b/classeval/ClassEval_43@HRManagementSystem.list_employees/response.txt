Inside the test() method, a HRManagementSystem object is created and assigned to the hr_system variable.
The employees attribute of hr_system is set to a dictionary with two employee records.
The employees attribute of hr_system is set to a dictionary with one employee record.
The list_employees() method is called on hr_system twice, and the return value is assigned to the variables res1 and res2 respectively.
Inside the list_employees() method, the employee_data dictionary is initialized to an empty dictionary.
The employees attribute of hr_system is checked to see if it is not empty.
A for loop iterates over the keys and values of the employees attribute of hr_system.
For each employee, an employee_details dictionary is created.
The employee_id is added to the employee_details dictionary with the key "employee_ID".
A for loop iterates over the keys and values of the employee_info dictionary.
For each key-value pair, the key and value are added to the employee_details dictionary.
The employee_details dictionary is added to the employee_data dictionary with the employee_id as the key.
After the loop completes, the employee_data dictionary is returned.
