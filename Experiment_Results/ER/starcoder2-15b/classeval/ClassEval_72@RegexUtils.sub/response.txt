Inside the test() method, the RegexUtils() class is instantiated and assigned to the variable ru.
The sub() method is called on the ru object, passing in the following arguments:
r'\b\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}\b': This is a regular expression pattern that matches a phone number in the format XXX-XXX-XXXX, where X represents a digit.
'phone num': This is the replacement string that will be used to replace the matched phone numbers.
"1234567890 abiguygusu 8762869876 kjgufwycs 9877629767": This is the text string that will be searched for phone numbers.
Inside the sub() method, the generate_phone_number_pattern() method is called to generate a regular expression pattern that matches a phone number in the format XXX-XXX-XXXX, where X represents a digit.
The match() method is called on the ru object, passing in the generated pattern and the text string.
If a match is found, the match object is returned. Otherwise, None is returned.
The match object is then used to replace the matched phone numbers with the replacement string 'phone num'.
<<<Output>>>
phone num abiguygusu phone num kjgufwycs phone num

<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method, the RegexUtils() class is instantiated and assigned to the variable ru.
The split_sentences() method is called on the ru object, passing in the following arguments:
"Hello, my name is John. I am 25 years old. I live in New York. I work as a software engineer.": This is the text string that will be split into sentences.
Inside the split_sentences() method, the generate_split_sentences_pattern() method is called to generate a regular expression pattern that matches the end of a sentence.
The pattern matches one of the following characters: ., or ?
The pattern also matches one or more whitespace characters (\s) followed by a capital letter ([A-Z]).
The split() method is called on the ru object, passing in the generated pattern and the text string.
The split() method uses the pattern to split the text string into a list of sentences.
<<<Output>>>
['Hello, my name is John.', 'I am 25 years old.', 'I live in New York.', 'I work as a software engineer.']
