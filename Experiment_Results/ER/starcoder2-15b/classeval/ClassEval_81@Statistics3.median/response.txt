Inside the test() method, the Statistics3() class is instantiated and assigned to the statistics3 variable.
The median() method is called on the statistics3 object, passing in the list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] as the data argument.
Inside the median() method, the data argument is sorted using the sorted() built-in function.
The sorted_data variable is assigned the sorted list.
The length of the sorted_data list is calculated using the len() built-in function and assigned to the n variable.
The n variable is checked to see if it is odd or even using the modulo operator (%).
If n is odd, the median is calculated by returning the element at the middle index of the sorted_data list.
If n is even, the median is calculated by returning the average of the two middle elements of the sorted_data list.
In this case, n is 8, which is even.
The median is calculated by returning the average of the two middle elements of the sorted_data list.
The middle index of the sorted_data list is calculated by dividing n by 2 and subtracting 1.
The two middle elements of the sorted_data list are the elements at the middle index and the index one less than the middle index.
The average of these two elements is calculated by adding them together and dividing by 2.
In this case, the middle index is 3 and the two middle elements are 4 and 5.
The average of these two elements is calculated by adding them together and dividing by 2, which is 4.5.
The median is returned, which is 4.5.
