Inside the test() method, the EncryptionUtils class is instantiated with the key "key".
The caesar_cipher() method is called with the arguments 'abcxyz' and 27.
Inside the caesar_cipher() method, the variable ciphertext is initialized to an empty string.
A for loop iterates over each character in plaintext.
Inside the for loop, if the current character is a letter (using the isalpha() method), the following code is executed:
If the character is uppercase (using the isupper() method), the variable ascii_offset is set to 65. Otherwise, it is set to 97.
The shifted_char variable is set to the result of applying the Caesar cipher to the current character.
The Caesar cipher shifts each letter by a certain number of positions. In this case, the shift is 27.
The shifted character is calculated by taking the ASCII value of the current character, subtracting the ascii_offset, adding the shift, and then taking the remainder of the result when divided by 26. The result is then added to the ascii_offset and converted back to a character using the chr() function.
The shifted character is added to the ciphertext variable.
If the current character is not a letter (using the isalpha() method), it is added to the ciphertext variable without modification.
After the for loop, the method returns the ciphertext variable.

What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
