Inside the test() method, the NLPDataProcessor class is instantiated and assigned to the self.processor variable.
The string_list variable is initialized to a list of three strings.
The stop_word_list variable is initialized to an empty list.
The remove_stop_words() method is called with string_list and stop_word_list as arguments.
Inside the remove_stop_words() method, the answer list is initialized to an empty list.
A for loop iterates over each string in string_list.
Inside the for loop, the string is split into a list of words using the split() method.
Another for loop iterates over each word in the string_split list.
Inside the inner for loop, if the word is in stop_word_list, it is removed from the string_split list using the remove() method.
After the inner for loop, the string_split list is appended to the answer list.
After the outer for loop, the answer list is returned.

<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
