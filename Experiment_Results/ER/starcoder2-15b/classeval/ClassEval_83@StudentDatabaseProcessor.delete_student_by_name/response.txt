Inside the test() method, the StudentDatabaseProcessor class is instantiated with the database name "test_database.db".
The create_student_table() method is called to create a table named "students" in the database.
A student_data dictionary is defined with the following key-value pairs:
'name': 'Alice'
'age': 20
'gender': 'female'
'grade': 90
The insert_student() method is called with the student_data dictionary as an argument. This inserts a new student record into the "students" table in the database.
A connection to the database is established using the sqlite3 module.
A cursor object is created to execute SQL queries on the database.
An SQL query is executed to select all student records from the "students" table where the name is 'Alice'.
The result of the query is fetched using the fetchall() method.
The connection to the database is closed.
The length of the result is returned.
The insert_student() method is called again with a new student_data dictionary.
The search_student_by_name() method is called with the name 'Bob' as an argument. This searches for a student record in the "students" table in the database with the name 'Bob'.
The length of the result is returned.
The insert_student() method is called again with a new student_data dictionary.
The delete_student_by_name() method is called with the name 'Charlie' as an argument. This deletes a student record from the "students" table in the database with the name 'Charlie'.
A connection to the database is established using the sqlite3 module.
A cursor object is created to execute SQL queries on the database.
An SQL query is executed to select all student records from the "students" table where the name is 'Charlie'.
The result of the query is fetched using the fetchall() method.
The connection to the database is closed.
The length of the result is returned.
