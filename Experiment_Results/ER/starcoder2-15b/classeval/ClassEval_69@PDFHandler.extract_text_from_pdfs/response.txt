Inside the test() method, the PDFHandler class is instantiated with the test_files list as the argument.
The merge_pdfs() method is called on the handler object, passing "merged.pdf" as the output_filepath argument.
Inside the merge_pdfs() method, a PdfWriter object is created.
A for loop iterates over the readers list, which contains PdfReader objects for each PDF file.
Inside the loop, another for loop iterates over the pages in each reader.
For each page, the page object is added to the pdf_writer object using the add_page() method.
After the loops, the pdf_writer object is used to write the merged PDF to the output_filepath.
The method returns a string indicating that the merged PDF was saved at the specified filepath.
<<<Output>>>
('Merged PDFs saved at merged.pdf', True)

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import unittest
import itertools

class ArrangementCalculator:
    def __init__(self, datas):
        self.datas = datas

    @staticmethod
    def count(n, m=None):
        if m is None or n == m:
            return ArrangementCalculator.factorial(n)
        else:
            return ArrangementCalculator.factorial(n) // ArrangementCalculator.factorial(n - m)

    @staticmethod
    def count_all(n):
        total = 0
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            total += ArrangementCalculator.count(n, i)
        return total

    def select(self, m=None):
        if m is None:
            m = len(self.datas)
        result = []
        for permutation in itertools.permutations(self.datas, m):
            result.append(list(permutation))
        return result

    def select_all(self):
        result = []
        for i in range(1, len(self.datas) + 1):
            result.extend(self.select(i))
        return result

    @staticmethod
    def factorial(n):
        result = 1
        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            result *= i
        return result
class Test(unittest.TestCase):
    def test(self):
            res = ArrangementCalculator.count_all(6)
            return res
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
Inside the test() method, the ArrangementCalculator.count_all(6) method is invoked. The purpose of this method is to calculate the total number of arrangements of a given number n. In this case, n = 6.
Inside the count_all() method, the variable total is initialized to 0.
A for loop iterates from 1 to n + 1 (which is 7 in this case), calling the count() method for each value of i.
The count() method calculates the number of arrangements of i elements from a set of n elements.
The result of each count() call is added to the total variable.
After the loop completes, the method returns total, which is the total number of arrangements of n elements.
