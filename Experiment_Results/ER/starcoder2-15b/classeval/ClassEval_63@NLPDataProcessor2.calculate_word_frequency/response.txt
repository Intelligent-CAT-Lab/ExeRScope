Inside the test() method, the calculate_word_frequency() method is invoked with the words_list argument.
Inside the calculate_word_frequency() method, the word_frequency variable is initialized to an empty Counter object.
A for loop iterates over each words in words_list.
Inside the loop, the update() method of the word_frequency Counter object is called with the words argument. This method updates the counter with elements from an iterable and increments the count for each element.
After the loop completes, the method returns word_frequency, which is a Counter object.
<<<Output>>>
Counter({'hello': 4, 'world': 3, 'this': 2, 'is': 2, 'test': 2})

<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method, the insert() method is called five times with the arguments 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
Inside the insert() method, a new Node object is created with the data argument.
If the head attribute of the LinkedList object is None, the head attribute is set to the new node.
Otherwise, a while loop is entered, iterating over each node in the linked list.
Inside the loop, the next attribute of the current node is set to the new node.
After the loop completes, the reverse() method is called.
Inside the reverse() method, the prev and current variables are initialized to None and the head attribute of the LinkedList object, respectively.
A while loop is entered, iterating over each node in the linked list.
Inside the loop, the next variable is set to the next attribute of the current node.
The next attribute of the current node is set to the prev variable.
The prev variable is set to the current node.
The current variable is set to the next variable.
After the loop completes, the head attribute of the LinkedList object is set to the prev variable.
The print_list() method is called.
Inside the print_list() method, the current variable is set to the head attribute of the LinkedList object.
A while loop is entered, iterating over each node in the linked list.
Inside the loop, the data attribute of the current node is printed.
The current variable is set to the next attribute of the current node.
After the loop completes, the method returns.
