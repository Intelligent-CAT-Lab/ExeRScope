Inside the test() method, a new RPGCharacter object is created with the name "John", hp = 100, attack_power = 20, defense = 10, and level = 1.
The hp attribute of the character object is set to 10.
The heal() method is called on the character object.
Inside the heal() method, the hp attribute of the character object is increased by 10.
The if statement checks if the hp attribute is greater than 100. Since the hp attribute is now 20, the if statement is not executed.
The method returns the updated hp attribute, which is 20.

<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
