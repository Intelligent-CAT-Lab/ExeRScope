Inside the test() method, the ExcelProcessor class is instantiated and assigned to the processor variable.
The write_excel() method is called on the processor object, passing in the new_data and save_file_name as arguments.
The new_data is a list of tuples, each containing a name, age, and country.
The save_file_name is an empty string.
Inside the write_excel() method, a try-except block is used to handle any exceptions that may occur when opening and writing to the Excel file.
The workbook variable is created using the openpyxl.Workbook() function.
The sheet variable is set to the active sheet of the workbook.
A for loop is used to iterate over the new_data list and append each row to the sheet.
The workbook is saved to the save_file_name using the save() method.
The workbook is closed using the close() method.
The method returns 1 if the file was successfully written, or 0 if an exception occurred.
