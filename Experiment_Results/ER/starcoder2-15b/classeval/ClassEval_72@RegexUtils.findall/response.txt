Inside the test() method, the RegexUtils() class is instantiated and assigned to the variable ru.
The findall() method is called on the ru object, passing in the pattern r'\b\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}\b' and the string "abiguygusu  111-111-1111 kjgufwycs 987-762-9767" as arguments.
The findall() method is a built-in method in the re module that returns a list of all non-overlapping matches of the pattern in the string.
In this case, the pattern is a regular expression that matches a phone number in the format XXX-XXX-XXXX, where X represents a digit.
The string passed to the findall() method contains two phone numbers: "111-111-1111" and "987-762-9767".
The findall() method returns a list containing these two phone numbers.
<<<Output>>>
['111-111-1111', '987-762-9767']

<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method, the RegexUtils() class is instantiated and assigned to the variable ru.
The split_sentences() method is called on the ru object, passing in the string "Hello, my name is John. I am 25 years old. I live in New York. I work as a software engineer." as an argument.
The split_sentences() method calls the generate_split_sentences_pattern() method to generate a regular expression pattern that matches the end of a sentence.
The pattern is a regular expression that matches a period, exclamation point, or question mark followed by one or more spaces and then an uppercase letter.
The split_sentences() method then calls the split() method, passing in the generated pattern and the string as arguments.
The split() method is a built-in method in the re module that splits the string into a list of substrings based on the pattern.
In this case, the pattern matches the end of a sentence, so the split() method splits the string into a list of sentences.
The split_sentences() method returns the list of sentences.
<<<Output>>>
['Hello, my name is John.', 'I am 25 years old.', 'I live in New York.', 'I work as a software engineer.']
