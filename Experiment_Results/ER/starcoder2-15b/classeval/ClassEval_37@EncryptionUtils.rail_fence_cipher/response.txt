Inside the test() method, the EncryptionUtils class is instantiated with the key "longkey".
The rail_fence_cipher() method is called with the arguments "AbCdEfG" and 2.
The rail_fence_cipher() method creates a 2-dimensional list fence, which is a list of lists. Each list in fence represents a row in the fence, and each element in the list represents a character in the fence. The length of each list is the length of the plain_text argument, which is 7 in this case.
The direction variable is initialized to -1.
The row and col variables are initialized to 0.
A for loop iterates over each character in the plain_text argument.
Inside the for loop, if the row is 0 or row is rails - 1 (which is 1 in this case), the direction is reversed by multiplying it by -1.
The current character is assigned to the corresponding position in the fence list.
The col variable is incremented by 1.
The row variable is incremented by direction.
After the for loop, an empty string encrypted_text is created.
A nested for loop iterates over each row and column in the fence list.
Inside the nested for loop, if the current character in the fence list is not '\n', it is appended to the encrypted_text string.
After the nested for loop, the encrypted_text string is returned.

<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Inside the test() method, the EncryptionUtils class is instantiated with the key "longkey".
The vigenere_cipher() method is called with the argument "AbCdEfG".
The vigenere_cipher() method creates an empty string encrypted_text.
The key_index variable is initialized to 0.
A for loop iterates over each character in the plain_text argument.
Inside the for loop, if the current character is a letter, the shift is calculated based on the current character and the key. The shift is the difference between the lowercase version of the current character and the lowercase version of the corresponding character in the key.
The encrypted_char is calculated
