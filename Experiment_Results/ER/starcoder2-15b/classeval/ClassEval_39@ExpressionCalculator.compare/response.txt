Inside the test() method, the compare() method is invoked with the arguments "*" and "+".
The compare() method is defined in the ExpressionCalculator class.
Inside the compare() method, the current_op and peek variables are initialized to the values of the arguments passed to the method.
The operat_priority list is defined in the ExpressionCalculator class.
The ord() function is used to get the ASCII value of the characters in the current_op and peek variables.
The ASCII value of the character '*' is 42, and the ASCII value of the character '+' is 43.
The ord() function returns the ASCII value of the character, so ord('*') returns 42 and ord('+') returns 43.
The ord() function is used to get the index of the current_op and peek characters in the operat_priority list.
The index of the character '*' in the operat_priority list is 2, and the index of the character '+' in the operat_priority list is 3.
