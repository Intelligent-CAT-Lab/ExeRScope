Inside the test() method, a JobMarketplace object is created and assigned to the variable jobMarketplace.
The submit_resume() method is called on the jobMarketplace object, passing in the following arguments:
"Tom" as the name
['skill1', 'skill2'] as the skills
"experience" as the experience
Inside the submit_resume() method, a resume dictionary is created with the given arguments.
The resume dictionary is then appended to the jobMarketplace.resumes list.
The resumes list is then returned.
<<<Output>>>
[{'name': 'Tom', 'skills': ['skill1', 'skill2'], 'experience': 'experience'}]

<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
