Inside the test() method, a BookManagement object is created and assigned to the bookManagement variable.
The add_book() method is called twice on the bookManagement object. The first call adds "book1" to the inventory with a quantity of 2, and the second call adds "book2" to the inventory with a quantity of 1.
The expected variable is created and assigned to a dictionary with the keys "book1" and "book2" and the values 2 and 1, respectively.
The bookManagement.inventory attribute is returned, which is a dictionary with the keys "book1" and "book2" and the values 2 and 1, respectively.
<<<Output>>>
{'book1': 2, 'book2': 1}

    def add_book(self, title, quantity=1):
        if title in self.inventory:

        if title not in self.inventory or self.inventory[title] < quantity:
            raise False
        self.inventory[title] -= quantity
        if self.inventory[title] == 0:
            del (self.inventory[title])

    def view_inventory(self):
        return self.inventory

    def view_book_quantity(self, title):
        if title not in self.inventory:
            return 0
        return self.inventory[title]
class Test(unittest.TestCase):

            bookManagement.add_book("book1", 2)
            bookManagement.add_book("book2")
            bookManagement.remove_book("book1", 1)
            expected = {"book1": 1, "book2": 1}
            return expected,bookManagement.inventory

<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
