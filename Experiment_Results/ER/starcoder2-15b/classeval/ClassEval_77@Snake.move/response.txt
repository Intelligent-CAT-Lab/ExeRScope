Inside the test() method, a Snake object is created with the following parameters:
SCREEN_WIDTH = 100
SCREEN_HEIGHT = 100
BLOCK_SIZE = 1
food_position = (51, 51)
The move() method is called with the direction (0, 0).
Inside the move() method, the current position of the snake is retrieved from the positions list.
The new position is calculated by adding the direction to the current position.
If the new position is equal to the food position, the eat_food() method is called.
If the length of the positions list is greater than 2 and the new position is in the positions list starting from the third element, the reset() method is called.
Otherwise, the new position is inserted at the beginning of the positions list and the last element is removed if the length of the positions list is greater than the length of the snake.
The random_food_position() method is called to generate a new food position.
Inside the random_food_position() method, a while loop is used to generate a random food position that is not in the positions list.
The food position is set to a random position within the screen boundaries.
The reset() method is called to reset the snake's length, positions, score, and food position.
Inside the reset() method, the length of the snake is set to 1, the positions list is set to a single element representing the starting position of the snake, the score is set to 0, and a new food position is generated using the random_food_position() method.
The eat_food() method is called to increase the length of the snake, increase the score, and generate a new food position.
Inside the eat_food() method, the length of the snake is increased by 1, the score is increased by 100, and a new food position is generated using the random_food_position() method.

What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
