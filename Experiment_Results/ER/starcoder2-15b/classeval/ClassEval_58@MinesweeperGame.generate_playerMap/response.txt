Inside the test() method, the MinesweeperGame class is instantiated with n = 1 and k = 4.
The generate_playerMap() method is called on the instance of the MinesweeperGame class.
Inside the generate_playerMap() method, a two-dimensional array of size n x n is created, where n = 1.
The array is initialized with '-' characters.
The method returns the array.

<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method, a LinkedList instance is created and assigned to the linked_list variable.
The insert() method is called on the linked_list instance, passing in the values 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
The reverse() method is called on the linked_list instance.
The print_list() method is called on the linked_list instance.
Inside the insert() method, a new Node instance is created for each value passed in.
The Node instances are linked together in a linked list.
Inside the reverse() method, the head node of the linked list is set to None.
The current node is set to the head node of the linked list.
A while loop is used to iterate through the linked list.
Inside the while loop, the next node is stored in the next variable.
The current node's next pointer is set to None.
The current node is set to the next node.
The head node of the linked list is set to the current node.
Inside the print_list() method, the head node of the linked list is set to the current node.
A while loop is used to iterate through the linked list.
Inside the while loop, the current node's data is printed.
The current node is set to the next node.
