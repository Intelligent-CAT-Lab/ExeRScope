Inside the test() method, a NumberWordFormatter object is created and assigned to the formatter variable.
The format() method of the formatter object is invoked with the argument 1.23.
Inside the format() method, the format_string() method is invoked with the argument "1.23".
Inside the format_string() method, the lstr and rstr variables are assigned the values of the first and second elements of the list returned by the expression (x.split('.') + [''])[:2], respectively.
The expression (x.split('.') + [''])[:2] is equivalent to ['1', '23', ''][:2], since x is "1.23".
The lstr variable is assigned the value of the first element of the list, which is "1".
The rstr variable is assigned the value of the second element of the list, which is "23".
The lstrrev variable is assigned the value of the reversed lstr, which is "1".
The a variable is assigned the value of a list of five empty strings.
The if statement checks if the length of lstrrev is not divisible by 3.
If it is not, the lstrrev variable is appended with "00" if it has an odd number of characters, or "0" if it has an even number of characters.
The lm variable is assigned an empty string.
The for loop iterates over the range of the length of lstrrev divided by 3.
Inside the for loop, the i variable is assigned the value of the current iteration.
The a[i] element of the a list is assigned the value of the substring of lstrrev from index 3 * i to index 3 * i + 3, reversed.
If the a[i] element is not equal to "000", the lm variable is assigned the value of the result of the trans_three() method with the argument a[i] concatenated with the result of the parse_more() method with the argument i concatenated with the lm variable.
If the a[i] element is equal to "000", the lm variable is assigned the value of the result of the trans_three() method with the argument a[i] concatenated with the lm variable.
The xs variable is assigned the value of "AND CENTS " concatenated with the result of the trans_two() method with the argument rstr concatenated with " " if rstr is not empty, or an empty string if rstr is empty.
If the lm variable is empty after removing leading and trailing whitespace, the method returns "ZERO ONLY".
Otherwise, the method returns the value of lm with leading and trailing whitespace removed concatenated with " " concatenated with the value of xs concatenated with "ONLY".
<<<Output>>>
ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY THREE CENTS ONLY
