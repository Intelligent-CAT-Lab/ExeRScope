Inside the test() method, a Thermostat object is created with the following parameters:
current_temperature = 20
target_temperature = 25
mode = 'heat'
The simulate_operation() method is called on the Thermostat object.
Inside the simulate_operation() method, the auto_set_mode() method is called.
Inside the auto_set_mode() method, the current_temperature and target_temperature attributes of the Thermostat object are compared. Since current_temperature is less than target_temperature, the mode attribute is set to 'heat'.
The simulate_operation() method continues by initializing the use_time variable to 0.
A while loop is entered, which will continue to run until the current_temperature attribute of the Thermostat object is equal to or greater than the target_temperature attribute.
Inside the while loop, the current_temperature attribute is incremented by 1, and use_time is incremented by 1.
After the while loop completes, use_time is returned.
<<<Output>>>
(25, 'heat', 25)

<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Inside the test() method, a Calculator object is created with the following parameters:
a = 10
b = 5
The add(), subtract(), multiply(), and divide() methods are called on the Calculator object.
Inside the add() method, the a and b attributes of the Calculator object are added together and returned.
Inside the subtract() method, the a and b attributes of the Calculator object are subtracted and returned.
Inside the multiply() method, the a and b attributes of the Calculator object are multiplied together and returned.
Inside the divide() method, the a and b attributes of the Calculator object are divided and returned.
