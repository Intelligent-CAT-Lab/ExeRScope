Inside the test() method, the BookManagementDB class is instantiated with the database name "test.db".
The connection to the database is established using the sqlite3 module.
The cursor object is created to execute SQL queries.
Three books are added to the database using the add_book() method.
The search_books() method is called to retrieve all books from the database.
The books variable is assigned the result of the search_books() method.
The length of the books list is returned as the first element of the return value.
The title of the first book is returned as the second element of the return value.
The author of the second book is returned as the third element of the return value.
The availability of the third book is returned as the fourth element of the return value.
<<<Output>>>
(3, 'Book 1', 'Author 2', 1)

<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method, a LinkedList object is instantiated.
The insert() method is called five times to add the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 to the linked list.
The remove() method is called to remove the node with the data value of 3 from the linked list.
The search() method is called to search for the data value of 3 in the linked list.
Since the data value of 3 was removed from the linked list, the search() method will return False.
<<<Output>>>
False
