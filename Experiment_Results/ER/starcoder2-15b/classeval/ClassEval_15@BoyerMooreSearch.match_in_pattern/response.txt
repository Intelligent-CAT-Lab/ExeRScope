Inside the test() method, the BoyerMooreSearch class is instantiated with the text "ABAABA" and the pattern "ABAB".
The match_in_pattern() method is called with the character 'B' as an argument.
Inside the match_in_pattern() method, a for loop iterates from self.patLen - 1 (which is 3) to 0, in decreasing order.
The first iteration: i=3, self.pattern[3] is 'B', which is equal to char, so the method returns 3.
The second iteration: i=2, self.pattern[2] is 'A', which is not equal to char, so the loop continues.
The third iteration: i=1, self.pattern[1] is 'B', which is equal to char, so the method returns 1.
The fourth iteration: i=0, self.pattern[0] is 'A', which is not equal to char, so the loop continues.
Since the loop completes without finding a match, the method returns -1.

<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method, the BoyerMooreSearch class is instantiated with the text "ABAABA" and the pattern "ABAB".
The mismatch_in_text() method is called with the currentPos argument set to 0.
Inside the mismatch_in_text() method, a for loop iterates from self.patLen - 1 (which is 3) to 0, in decreasing order.
The first iteration: i=3, self.pattern[3] is 'B', which is not equal to self.text[0 + 3] (which is 'A'), so the method returns 3.
The second iteration: i=2, self.pattern[2] is 'A', which is not equal to self.text[0 + 2] (which is 'B'), so the loop continues.
The third iteration: i=1, self.pattern[1] is 'B', which is not equal to self.text[0 + 1] (which is 'A'), so the loop continues.
The fourth iteration: i=0, self.pattern[0] is 'A', which is not equal to self.text[0 + 0] (which is 'A'), so the loop continues.
Since the loop completes without finding a mismatch, the method returns -1.
