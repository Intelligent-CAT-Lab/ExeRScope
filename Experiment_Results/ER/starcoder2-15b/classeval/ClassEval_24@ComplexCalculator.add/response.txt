Inside the test() method, the ComplexCalculator class is instantiated and assigned to the complexCalculator variable.
The add() method of the ComplexCalculator class is invoked with two complex numbers as arguments: (1 + 2j) and (3 + 4j).
Inside the add() method, the real and imaginary parts of the two complex numbers are added separately.
The real part of the result is the sum of the real parts of the two complex numbers, and the imaginary part is the sum of the imaginary parts.
The real and imaginary parts of the result are passed to the complex() function to create a new complex number.
The complex() function returns the complex number with the specified real and imaginary parts.
The add() method returns the result of the addition.
<<<Output>>>
(4+6j)

<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Inside the test() method, the Calculator class is instantiated and assigned to the calculator variable.
The add() method of the Calculator class is invoked with two numbers as arguments: 1 and 2.
Inside the add() method, the two numbers are added together using the + operator.
The add() method returns the result of the addition.
