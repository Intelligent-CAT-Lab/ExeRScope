Inside the test() method, an instance of the AccessGatewayFilter class is created.
A request dictionary is created with a 'headers' key and a 'Authorization' key.
The 'Authorization' key has a 'user' key and a 'jwt' key.
The 'user' key has a 'name' key with the value 'user1'.
The 'jwt' key has a value that is the concatenation of 'user1' and the string representation of the current date minus 5 days.
The get_jwt_user() method is called with the request dictionary as an argument.
Inside the get_jwt_user() method, the token variable is set to the value of request['headers']['Authorization'].
The user variable is set to the value of token['user'].
The jwt_str_date variable is set to the value of token['jwt'].split(user['name'])[1].
The jwt_date variable is set to the value of datetime.datetime.strptime(jwt_str_date, "%Y-%m-%d").
The datetime.datetime.today() - jwt_date >= datetime.timedelta(days=3) expression is evaluated.
The datetime.datetime.today() function is called to get the current date and time.
The datetime.timedelta(days=3) function is called to create a timedelta object representing 3 days.
The - operator is used to subtract the jwt_date from the current date and time.
The >= operator is used to compare the result to the timedelta object.
If the result is True, the method returns None.
If the result is False, the method returns token.
In this case, the jwt_str_date variable is set to the value of token['jwt'].split(user['name'])[1].
The jwt_str_date variable is set to the value of token['jwt'].split(user['name'])[1].
The jwt_date variable is set to the value of datetime.datetime.strptime(jwt_str_date, "%Y-%m-%d").
The datetime.datetime.today() - jwt_date >= datetime.timedelta(days=3) expression is evaluated.
