Inside the test() method, the SQLGenerator class is instantiated with the table name 'table1'.
The delete() method is called with the condition "field1 = value1 AND field2 = value2 AND field3 = value3 AND field4 = value4".
Inside the delete() method, the sql variable is initialized to "DELETE FROM table1 WHERE field1 = value1 AND field2 = value2 AND field3 = value3 AND field4 = value4".
The sql variable is concatenated with a semicolon (";") and returned.
<<<Output>>>
DELETE FROM table1 WHERE field1 = value1 AND field2 = value2 AND field3 = value3 AND field4 = value4;

<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method, the SQLGenerator class is instantiated with the table name 'table1'.
The select_female_under_age() method is called with the age 20.
Inside the select_female_under_age() method, the condition variable is initialized to "age < 20 AND gender = 'female'".
The select() method is called with the condition argument set to the condition variable.
Inside the select() method, the sql variable is initialized to "SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE age < 20 AND gender = 'female'".
The sql variable is concatenated with a semicolon (";") and returned.
<<<Output>>>
SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE age < 20 AND gender = 'female';
