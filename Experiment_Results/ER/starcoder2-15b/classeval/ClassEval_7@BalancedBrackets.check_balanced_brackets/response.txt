Inside the test() method, a BalancedBrackets object is created with the expression "a(b{c]]".
The check_balanced_brackets() method is called on the object.
Inside the check_balanced_brackets() method, the clear_expr() method is called.
Inside the clear_expr() method, the expression is filtered to remove any characters that are not brackets.
The expression is then set to the filtered expression.
The for loop iterates over each character in the expression.
If the character is a left bracket, it is appended to the stack.
If the character is a right bracket, the current bracket is popped from the stack.
If the current bracket is a left parenthesis, the character is checked to see if it is a right parenthesis. If it is not, False is returned.
If the current bracket is a left curly bracket, the character is checked to see if it is a right curly bracket. If it is not, False is returned.
If the current bracket is a left square bracket, the character is checked to see if it is a right square bracket. If it is not, False is returned.
After the for loop, the stack is checked to see if it is empty. If it is not, False is returned.
Finally, True is returned.

<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
