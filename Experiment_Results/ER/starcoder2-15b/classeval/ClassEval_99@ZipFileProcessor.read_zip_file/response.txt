Inside the test() method, the ZipFileProcessor class is instantiated with the zip_file_name argument.
The read_zip_file() method is called on the processor object.
Inside the read_zip_file() method, a try-except block is used to handle any exceptions that may occur when opening the zip file.
If an exception is raised, None is returned.
If no exception is raised, the zip file is opened in read mode ('r') and returned.
The zip_file object is then closed using the close() method.
The zip_file_name and mode attributes of the zip_file object are returned as a tuple.

<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
