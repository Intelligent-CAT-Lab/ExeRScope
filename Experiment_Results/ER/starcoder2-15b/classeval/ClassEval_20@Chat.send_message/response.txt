Inside the test() method, a Chat object is created and assigned to the chat variable.
The chat.users dictionary is then assigned to {'John': [], 'Mary': []}.
The send_message() method is invoked with the arguments 'Amy', 'Amy', and 'Hello'.
Inside the send_message() method, the sender and receiver are checked to see if they are in the users dictionary. Since 'Amy' is not in the users dictionary, the method returns False.
<<<Output>>>
(False, {'John': [], 'Mary': []})

<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Inside the test() method, a Calculator object is created and assigned to the calculator variable. The arguments 10 and 5 are passed to the Calculator constructor, which assigns them to the a and b attributes of the object.
The add(), subtract(), multiply(), and divide() methods are invoked on the calculator object.
Inside the add() method, the a and b attributes are added and returned.
Inside the subtract() method, the b attribute is subtracted from the a attribute and returned.
Inside the multiply() method, the a and b attributes are multiplied and returned.
Inside the divide() method, the a attribute is divided by the b attribute and returned.
