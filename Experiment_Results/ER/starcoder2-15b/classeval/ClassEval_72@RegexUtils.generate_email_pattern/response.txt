Inside the test() method, the RegexUtils() class is instantiated and assigned to the variable ru.
The generate_email_pattern() method is called on the ru object, and the returned pattern is assigned to the variable pat.
The match() method is called on the ru object, passing pat and 'iustd87t2euh@163.com' as arguments.
Inside the match() method, the re.match() function is called with the pattern and text arguments.
The re.match() function attempts to match the pattern against the text, and returns a Match object if a match is found, or None if no match is found.
In this case, the pattern is a regular expression that matches an email address, and the text is 'iustd87t2euh@163.com'.
Since the text matches the pattern, the re.match() function returns a Match object, which is truthy.
The match() method returns True, which is assigned to the variable res.

<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method, the RegexUtils() class is instantiated and assigned to the variable ru.
The generate_email_pattern() method is called on the ru object, and the returned pattern is assigned to the variable pat.
The findall() method is called on the ru object, passing pat and 'iustd87t2euh@163.com' as arguments.
Inside the findall() method, the re.findall() function is called with the pattern and text arguments.
The re.findall() function attempts to find all non-overlapping matches of the pattern in the text, and returns a list of the matches.
In this case, the pattern is a regular expression that matches an email address, and the text is 'iustd87t2euh@163.com'.
Since the text matches the pattern, the re.findall() function returns a list containing the matched email address, which is assigned to the variable res.
