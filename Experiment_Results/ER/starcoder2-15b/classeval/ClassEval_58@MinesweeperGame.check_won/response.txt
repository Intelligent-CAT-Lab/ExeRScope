Inside the test() method, a MinesweeperGame object is created with n = 3 and k = 1.
The minesweeper_map and player_map attributes of the object are set to specific values.
The check_won() method is called with the player_map as an argument.
Inside the check_won() method, a nested for loop is used to iterate over the player_map.
For each element in the player_map, if the element is '-' and the corresponding element in the minesweeper_map is not 'X', the method returns False.
If the method reaches the end of the nested for loop without returning False, it returns True.

<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method, a LinkedList object is created and assigned to the linked_list variable.
The insert() method is called five times with different values (1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) as arguments.
The print_list() method is called, which prints the elements of the linked list.
The reverse() method is called, which reverses the order of the elements in the linked list.
The print_list() method is called again, which prints the reversed elements of the linked list.
