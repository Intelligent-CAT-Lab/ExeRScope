Inside the test() method, an instance of the AccessGatewayFilter class is created.
A request dictionary is created with the following keys and values:
'path': '/abc'
'method': 'POST'
'headers': {
'Authorization': {'user': {'name': 'user1', 'level': 5, 'address': 'address1'},
'jwt': 'user1' + str(datetime.date.today())}
}
The filter() method is called on the AccessGatewayFilter instance with the request dictionary as an argument.
Inside the filter() method, the request_uri variable is set to the value of the 'path' key in the request dictionary.
The method is_start_with() is called with the request_uri as an argument.
Inside the is_start_with() method, the start_with list is iterated over.
For each element in the start_with list, the startswith() method is called on the request_uri with the element as an argument.
If the request_uri starts with the element, True is returned.
If the request_uri does not start with any element in the start_with list, False is returned.
The method get_jwt_user() is called with the request dictionary as an argument.
Inside the get_jwt_user() method, the token variable is set to the value of the 'Authorization' key in the request dictionary.
The user variable is set to the value of the 'user' key in the token dictionary.
If the 'jwt' key in the token dictionary starts with the 'name' key in the user dictionary, the jwt_str_date variable is set to the value of the 'jwt' key in the token dictionary, split by the 'name' key in the user dictionary.
The jwt_date variable is set to the result of calling the strptime() method on the datetime module with jwt_str_date and "%Y-%m-%d" as arguments.
If the result of subtracting the current date from jwt_date is greater than or equal to 3 days, None is returned.
If the result of subtracting the current date from jwt_date is less than 3 days, the token dictionary is returned.
The method set_current_user_info_and_log() is called with the user dictionary as an argument.
Inside the set_current_user_info_and_log() method, the host variable is set to the value of the 'address' key in the user dictionary.
The log() method is called on the logging module with the following arguments:
msg: The value of the 'name' key in the user dictionary concatenated with the host variable and the current date and time.
level: 1
The method returns True.
