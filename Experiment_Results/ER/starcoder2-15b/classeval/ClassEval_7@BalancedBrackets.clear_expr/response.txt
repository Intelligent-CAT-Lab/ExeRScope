Inside the test() method, a BalancedBrackets object is created with the expression "[a](b){c}".
The clear_expr() method is called on the object.
Inside the clear_expr() method, the expr attribute of the object is modified by removing all characters that are not brackets.
The modified expression is assigned back to the expr attribute.
After the clear_expr() method is called, the expr attribute of the object is "[a](b){c}".
The modified expression is returned by the clear_expr() method.
<<<Output>>>
[a](b){c}

<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method, a BalancedBrackets object is created with the expression "[a](b){c}".
The check_balanced_brackets() method is called on the object.
Inside the check_balanced_brackets() method, the clear_expr() method is called on the object.
Inside the clear_expr() method, the expr attribute of the object is modified by removing all characters that are not brackets.
The modified expression is assigned back to the expr attribute.
After the clear_expr() method is called, the expr attribute of the object is "[a](b){c}".
The for loop iterates over each character in the expr attribute.
For each character, the following steps are performed:
If the character is a left bracket, it is appended to the stack attribute.
If the character is a right bracket, the last element of the stack attribute is popped and assigned to Current_Brkt.
If Current_Brkt is "(", the character is checked to see if it is ")". If it is not, False is returned.
If Current_Brkt is "{", the character is checked to see if it is "}". If it is not, False is returned.
If Current_Brkt is "[", the character is checked to see if it is "]". If it is not, False is returned.
After the for loop completes, the stack attribute is checked to see if it is empty. If it is not, False is returned.
Finally, True is returned.
<<<Output>>>
True
