Inside the test() method, a WeatherSystem object is created with the city name 'New York'.
A weather_list dictionary is defined with two cities: 'New York' and 'Beijing'.
The query() method is called on the weatherSystem object, passing in the weather_list dictionary and the tmp_units parameter set to 'fahrenheit'.
Inside the query() method, the weather_list parameter is assigned to the weather_list attribute of the object.
The city attribute of the object is checked to see if it is in the weather_list dictionary. Since 'New York' is in the dictionary, the temperature and weather attributes of the object are set to the corresponding values in the dictionary.
The temperature units in the dictionary are checked to see if they are equal to the tmp_units parameter. Since they are not, the celsius_to_fahrenheit() method is called on the object.
Inside the celsius_to_fahrenheit() method, the temperature attribute of the object is multiplied by 9/5 and added to 32. This converts the temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit.
The converted temperature and the weather attribute of the object are returned.
<<<Output>>>
(80.6, 'sunny')

<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method, a Calculator object is created with the parameters a=10 and b=5.
The add(), subtract(), multiply(), and divide() methods are called on the calculator object, and their return values are returned.
Inside the add() method, the a and b attributes of the object are added together and returned.
Inside the subtract() method, the a and b attributes of the object are subtracted and returned.
Inside the multiply() method, the a and b attributes of the object are multiplied together and returned.
Inside the divide() method, the a and b attributes of the object are divided and returned.
