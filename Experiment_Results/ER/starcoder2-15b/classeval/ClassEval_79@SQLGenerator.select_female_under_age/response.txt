Inside the test() method, the SQLGenerator class is instantiated with the table name 'table1'.
The select_female_under_age() method is called with the age parameter set to 40.
Inside the select_female_under_age() method, the condition parameter is set to a string that contains the condition "age < 40 AND gender = 'female'".
The select() method is called with the condition parameter set to the condition string.
Inside the select() method, the fields parameter is set to the default value of "*", and the condition parameter is set to the condition string.
The sql variable is set to a string that contains the SQL SELECT statement with the fields and condition parameters.
The sql variable is returned, appended with a semicolon.
<<<Output>>>
SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE age < 40 AND gender = 'female';

<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
