Inside the test() method, the BigNumCalculator class is instantiated and assigned to the bigNum variable.
The multiply() method is called on the bigNum object, passing in the strings '923456789' and '187654321' as arguments.
Inside the multiply() method, the length of each number is calculated using the len() function.
The result list is initialized to a list of zeros with a length of len1 + len2.
A nested for loop is used to iterate over each digit in num1 and num2.
Inside the inner loop, the multiplication of the current digits is calculated using the int() function to convert them to integers.
The positions p1 and p2 are calculated based on the current indices i and j.
The total is calculated by adding the multiplication result to the value at position p2 in the result list.
The value at position p1 in the result list is incremented by the quotient of total // 10.
The value at position p2 in the result list is set to the remainder of total % 10.
After the nested loop, a while loop is used to remove leading zeros from the result list.
The start variable is initialized to 0.
While start is less than the length of result minus 1 and the value at position start in result is 0, start is incremented by 1.
The join() method is called on the map() function, which applies the str() function to each element in the result list starting from position start.
The resulting string is returned.
