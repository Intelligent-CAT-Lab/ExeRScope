Inside the test() method, the _convert_key() method is invoked with the argument 'first_name'.
Inside the _convert_key() method, the isinstance() function is used to check if the key is an instance of the str class. Since 'first_name' is a string, the condition is True.
The _to_camel_case() method is called with the key as an argument.
Inside the _to_camel_case() method, the key is split on the underscore character ('_'). This results in a list of strings: ['first', 'name'].
The first element of the list is concatenated with the result of the following expression: ''.join(part.title() for part in parts[1:]). This expression joins the capitalized versions of the remaining elements of the list, resulting in 'FirstName'.
The _to_camel_case() method returns 'FirstName'.
The _convert_key() method returns 'FirstName'.
The test() method returns 'FirstName'.
<<<Output>>>
FirstName

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import unittest
class CamelCaseMap:
    def __init__(self):
        self._data = {}

    def __getitem__(self, key):
        return self._data[self._convert_key(key)]

    def __setitem__(self, key, value):
        self._data[self._convert_key(key)] = value

    def __delitem__(self, key):
        del self._data[self._convert_key(key)]

    def __iter__(self):
        return iter(self._data)

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self._data)

    def _convert_key(self, key):
        if isinstance(key, str):
            return self._to_camel_case(key)
        return key

    @staticmethod
    def _to_camel_case(key):
        parts = key.split('_')
        return parts[0] + ''.join(part.title() for part in parts[1:])
class Test(unittest.TestCase):
    def test(self):
            camelize_map = CamelCaseMap()
            camelize_map['first_name'] = 'John'
            return camelize_map['first_name']
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Inside the test() method, a CamelCaseMap object is instantiated and assigned to the camelize_map variable.
The __setitem__() method is called on the camelize_map object with the key 'first_name' and the value 'John'.
Inside the __setitem__() method, the _convert_key() method is called with the key as an argument.
Inside the _convert_key() method, the isinstance() function is used to check if the key is an instance of the str class. Since 'first_name' is a string, the condition is True.
The _to_camel_case() method is called with the key as an argument.
Inside the _to_camel_case() method, the key is split on the underscore character ('_'). This results in a list of strings: ['first', 'name'].
The first element of the list is concatenated with the result of the following expression: ''.join(part.title() for part in parts[1:]). This expression joins the capitalized versions of the remaining elements of the list, resulting in 'FirstName'.
The _to_camel_case() method returns 'FirstName'.
The _convert_key() method returns 'FirstName'.
The __setitem__() method sets the value 'John' in the _data dictionary of the camelize_map object, using the converted key 'FirstName'.
The __getitem__() method is called on the camelize_map object with the key 'first_name'.
Inside the __getitem__() method, the _convert_key() method is called with the key as an argument.
