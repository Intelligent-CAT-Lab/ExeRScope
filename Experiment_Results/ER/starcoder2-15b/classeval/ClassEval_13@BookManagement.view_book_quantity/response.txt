Inside the test() method, a BookManagement object is created and assigned to the bookManagement variable.
The add_book() method is called on the bookManagement object, passing "book1" as the title and 2 as the quantity.
The view_book_quantity() method is called on the bookManagement object, passing "book1" as the title.
Inside the view_book_quantity() method, the if statement checks if the title is not in the inventory dictionary. If it is not, 0 is returned.
Since "book1" is in the inventory dictionary, the else block is executed, and the value associated with "book1" in the inventory dictionary is returned.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import unittest
class BookManagement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.inventory = {}

    def add_book(self, title, quantity=1):
        if title in self.inventory:
            self.inventory[title] += quantity
        else:
            self.inventory[title] = quantity

    def remove_book(self, title, quantity):
        if title not in self.inventory or self.inventory[title] < quantity:
            raise False
        self.inventory[title] -= quantity
        if self.inventory[title] == 0:
            del (self.inventory[title])

    def view_inventory(self):
        return self.inventory

    def view_book_quantity(self, title):
        if title not in self.inventory:
            return 0
        return self.inventory[title]
class Test(unittest.TestCase):

            bookManagement = BookManagement()
            bookManagement.add_book("book1", 2)
            bookManagement.remove_book("book1", 1)
            return bookManagement.view_book_quantity('book1')

<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method, a BookManagement object is created and assigned to the bookManagement variable.
The add_book() method is called on the bookManagement object, passing "book1" as the title and 2 as the quantity.
The remove_book() method is called on the bookManagement object, passing "book1" as the title and 1 as the quantity.
Inside the remove_book() method, the if statement checks if the title is not in the inventory dictionary or if the value associated with the title in the inventory dictionary is less than the quantity. If either of these conditions is true, False is raised.
Since "book1" is in the inventory dictionary and the value associated with it is greater than or equal to 1, the else block is executed.
The value associated with "book1" in the inventory dictionary is decremented by 1.
The if statement checks if the value associated with "book1" in the inventory dictionary is equal to 0. Since it is not, the else block is executed.
The view_book_quantity() method is called on the bookManagement object, passing "book1" as the title.
Inside the view_book_quantity() method, the if statement checks if the title is not in the inventory dictionary. Since "book1" is in the inventory dictionary, the else block is executed, and the value associated with "book1" in the inventory dictionary is returned.
