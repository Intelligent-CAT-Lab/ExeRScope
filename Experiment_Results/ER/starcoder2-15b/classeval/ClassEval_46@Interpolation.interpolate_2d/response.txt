Inside the test() method, the interpolate_2d() method is invoked. The purpose of this method is to perform bilinear interpolation on a 2D grid of data points.
The interpolate_2d() method takes the following arguments:
x: A list of x-coordinates of the data points.
y: A list of y-coordinates of the data points.
z: A 2D list of z-values of the data points.
x_interp: A list of x-coordinates at which to interpolate the z-values.
y_interp: A list of y-coordinates at which to interpolate the z-values.
The method returns a list of interpolated z-values at the specified x_interp and y_interp coordinates.
Inside the interpolate_2d() method, the z_interp list is initialized to an empty list.
A nested for loop iterates over the x and y coordinates of the data points. For each data point, the method checks if the x and y coordinates are within the range of the x_interp and y_interp coordinates. If they are, the method performs bilinear interpolation to calculate the interpolated z-value at that point.
The bilinear interpolation formula is used to calculate the interpolated z-value at the specified x_interp and y_interp coordinates. The formula is as follows:
zi = (z00 * (x[i+1] - xi) * (y[j+1] - yi) +
      z10 * (xi - x[i]) * (y[j+1] - yi) +
      z01 * (x[i+1] - xi) * (yi - y[j]) +
      z11 * (xi - x[i]) * (yi - y[j])) / ((x[i+1] - x[i]) * (y[j+1] - y[j]))
where z00, z10, z01, and z11 are the z-values of the four data points that surround the specified x_interp and y_interp coordinates.
The interpolated z-value is appended to the z_interp list.
After the nested for loop completes, the method returns the z_interp list, which contains the interpolated z-values at the specified x_interp and y_interp coordinates.
