Inside the test() method, a BlackjackGame object is created and assigned to the variable blackjackGame.
The create_deck() method is called on the blackjackGame object, which returns a shuffled deck of cards.
The calculate_hand_value() method is called on the blackjackGame object, passing in a hand of cards.
Inside the calculate_hand_value() method, the variable value is initialized to 0.
The variable num_aces is initialized to 0.
A for loop iterates over each card in the hand.
Inside the for loop, the rank of the card is extracted by slicing the card string.
If the rank is a digit, it is converted to an integer and added to value.
If the rank is 'J', 'Q', or 'K', 10 is added to value.
If the rank is 'A', 11 is added to value and num_aces is incremented by 1.
A while loop is used to check if value is greater than 21 and num_aces is greater than 0.
Inside the while loop, value is reduced by 10 and num_aces is decremented by 1.
After the while loop, value is returned.

<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method, a BlackjackGame object is created and assigned to the variable blackjackGame.
The create_deck() method is called on the blackjackGame object, which returns a shuffled deck of cards.
The check_winner() method is called on the blackjackGame object, passing in two identical hands.
Inside the check_winner() method, the calculate_hand_value() method is called twice, passing in the player_hand and dealer_hand.
The calculate_hand_value() method returns the value of the hand, which is 22 in this case.
The player_value and dealer_value variables are assigned the value 22.
The if statement checks if both player_value and dealer_value are greater than 21.
Since both values are 22, the if statement is executed.
The if statement checks if player_
