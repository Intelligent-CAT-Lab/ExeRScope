Inside the test() method, a BankAccount object is created and assigned to the account1 variable.
The view_balance() method is called on the account1 object.
Inside the view_balance() method, the balance attribute of the account1 object is returned.
Since the balance attribute is initialized to 0 in the constructor, the view_balance() method returns 0.
<<<Output>>>
0

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import unittest
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, balance=0):
        self.balance = balance

    def deposit(self, amount):
        if amount < 0:
            raise ValueError("Invalid amount")
        self.balance += amount
        return self.balance

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        if amount < 0:
            raise ValueError("Invalid amount")
        if amount > self.balance:
            raise ValueError("Insufficient balance.")
        self.balance -= amount
        return self.balance

    def view_balance(self):
        return self.balance

    def transfer(self, other_account, amount):
        self.withdraw(amount)
        other_account.deposit(amount)
class Test(unittest.TestCase):
    def test(self):
            account1 = BankAccount()
            account2 = BankAccount()
            account1.deposit(100)
            account1.transfer(account2, 50)
            return account1.view_balance()
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method, two BankAccount objects are created and assigned to the account1 and account2 variables respectively.
The deposit() method is called on the account1 object with an amount of 100.
The transfer() method is called on the account1 object, passing in the account2 object and an amount of 50.
Inside the transfer() method, the withdraw() method is called on the account1 object with an amount of 50.
Inside the withdraw() method, the balance attribute of the account1 object is decreased by 50.
The deposit() method is called on the account2 object with an amount of 50.
Inside the deposit() method, the balance attribute of the account2 object is increased by 50.
The view_balance() method is called on the account1 object.
Inside the view_balance() method, the balance attribute of the account1 object is returned.
Since the balance attribute of the account1 object is 50 after the transfer, the view_balance() method returns 50.
<<<Output>>>
50
