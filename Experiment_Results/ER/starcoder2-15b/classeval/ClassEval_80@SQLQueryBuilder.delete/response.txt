Inside the test() method, the SQLQueryBuilder.delete() method is invoked with two arguments: 'items' and {'name': 'bbb'}.
The purpose of this method is to generate a SQL DELETE statement.
Inside the delete() method, the query variable is initialized to a string that contains the DELETE FROM items part of the statement.
If the where argument is not None, the query string is appended with a WHERE clause.
The WHERE clause is generated by joining the keys and values of the where dictionary using the AND operator.
The keys and values are formatted as key='value' pairs.
The method returns the query string.
<<<Output>>>
DELETE FROM items WHERE name='bbb'

<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Inside the test() method, the Calculator class is instantiated with two arguments: 10 and 5.
The purpose of this class is to perform basic arithmetic operations on two numbers.
Inside the divide() method, the a and b attributes of the Calculator object are divided and the result is returned.
