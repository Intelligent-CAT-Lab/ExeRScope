Inside the test() method, the AssessmentSystem class is instantiated and assigned to the assessment_system variable.
The students attribute of the assessment_system object is then assigned a dictionary with five students. Each student has a name, grade, major, and courses.
The get_all_students_with_fail_course() method is called on the assessment_system object.
Inside the get_all_students_with_fail_course() method, a list called students is initialized.
A for loop iterates over the keys and values of the students attribute of the assessment_system object.
Inside the for loop, another for loop iterates over the keys and values of the courses attribute of each student.
If the score of a course is less than 60, the name of the student is appended to the students list and the inner for loop is broken.
After the outer for loop completes, the students list is returned.
