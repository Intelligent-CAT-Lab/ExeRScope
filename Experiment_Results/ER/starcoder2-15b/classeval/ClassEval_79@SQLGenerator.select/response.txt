Inside the test() method, the SQLGenerator class is instantiated with the table name 'table1'.
The select() method is called with two arguments: a list of field names ['field1'] and a condition string "field2 = value1, field3 = value2".
Inside the select() method, the fields argument is assigned to the fields variable. If the fields argument is None, the fields variable is set to the string "*", otherwise it is set to a comma-separated string of the field names.
The sql variable is initialized to a string that contains the SELECT statement with the fields and table name.
If the condition argument is not None, the sql variable is appended with a WHERE clause containing the condition.
The sql variable is appended with a semicolon (";") and returned.
<<<Output>>>
SELECT field1 FROM table1 WHERE field2 = value1, field3 = value2;

<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
