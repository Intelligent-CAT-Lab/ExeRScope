Inside the test() method, the DiscountStrategy class is instantiated with the customer, cart, and promotion arguments.
The customer argument is a dictionary with the name and fidelity keys.
The cart argument is a list of dictionaries, each representing an item in the customer's cart.
The promotion argument is None, indicating that no promotion is applied.
The DiscountStrategy class has three methods: total(), due(), and three static methods: FidelityPromo(), BulkItemPromo(), and LargeOrderPromo().
The total() method calculates the total price of the items in the cart by multiplying the quantity and price of each item and summing them.
The due() method calculates the total price after applying the promotion. If the promotion argument is None, the discount is 0. Otherwise, the promotion method is called with the order as an argument and the discount is calculated.
The three static methods are promotion strategies that can be used with the due() method.
The FidelityPromo() method calculates a 5% discount if the customer's fidelity is greater than or equal to 1000.
The BulkItemPromo() method calculates a 10% discount for each item in the cart if the quantity is greater than or equal to 20.
The LargeOrderPromo() method calculates a 7% discount if the number of unique products in the cart is greater than or equal to 10.
