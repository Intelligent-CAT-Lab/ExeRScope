Inside the test() method, a VendingMachine object is created and assigned to the variable vendingMachine.
The inventory attribute of vendingMachine is set to a dictionary with a single key-value pair: 'Coke' and a dictionary with the price and quantity of Coke.
The balance attribute of vendingMachine is set to 0.
The purchase_item() method is called on vendingMachine with the argument 'Coke'.
Inside the purchase_item() method, the item_name is checked to see if it is in the inventory.
Since 'Coke' is in the inventory, the item variable is set to the dictionary with the price and quantity of Coke.
The quantity of Coke is checked to see if it is greater than 0 and the balance is checked to see if it is greater than or equal to the price of Coke.
Since the quantity of Coke is 10 and the balance is 0, the condition is not met.
The method returns False.
The inventory attribute of vendingMachine is returned.
<<<Output>>>
(False, {'Coke': {'price': 1.25, 'quantity': 10}})

<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method, a VendingMachine object is created and assigned to the variable vendingMachine.
The inventory attribute of vendingMachine is set to a dictionary with a single key-value pair: 'Coke' and a dictionary with the price and quantity of Coke.
