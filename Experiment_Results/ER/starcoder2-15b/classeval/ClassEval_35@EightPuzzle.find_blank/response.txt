Inside the test() method, the EightPuzzle class is instantiated with the initial_state parameter set to the provided state variable.
The find_blank() method is called on the eightPuzzle object with the initial_state as the argument.
Inside the find_blank() method, a nested for loop is used to iterate over the rows and columns of the state variable.
If the value at the current position is 0, the method returns the row and column indices as a tuple.
The return statement is executed, and the method returns the tuple (i, j).

<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method, the EightPuzzle class is instantiated with the initial_state parameter set to the provided state variable.
The move() method is called on the eightPuzzle object with the initial_state and 'up' as the arguments.
Inside the move() method, the find_blank() method is called with the state argument.
The find_blank() method returns the row and column indices of the blank space in the state.
The new_state variable is initialized to a copy of the state using list comprehension.
The if statement checks if the direction argument is 'up'.
If it is, the values at the blank space and the space above it are swapped in the new_state.
The return statement is executed, and the method returns the new_state.
