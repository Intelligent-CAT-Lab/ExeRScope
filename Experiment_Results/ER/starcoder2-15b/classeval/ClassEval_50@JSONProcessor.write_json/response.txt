Inside the test() method, the JSONProcessor class is instantiated and assigned to the self.processor variable.
A dictionary self.test_data is created with three key-value pairs.
A file path self.file_path is created and assigned the value "test.json".
A file path self.file_path_only_read is created and assigned the value "test_only_read.json".
A file is opened in write mode using the with statement. The file is closed automatically after the with block is executed.
The file is written with a JSON string.
The file permissions are set to read-only using the os.chmod() function.
The write_json() method is called with the self.test_data and self.file_path_only_read as arguments.
Inside the write_json() method, a try-except block is used to handle exceptions.
If an exception occurs, the method returns -1.

<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
