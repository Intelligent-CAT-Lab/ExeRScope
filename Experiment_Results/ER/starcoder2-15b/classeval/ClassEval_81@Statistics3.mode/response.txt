Inside the test() method, the Statistics3 class is instantiated and assigned to the statistics3 variable.
The mode() method is called on the statistics3 object, passing in the list [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5] as the data argument.
Inside the mode() method, a dictionary called counts is created.
A for loop iterates over each value in the data list.
For each value, the value is added to the counts dictionary as a key, and the value is set to 1 if it doesn't already exist in the dictionary, or incremented by 1 if it already exists.
The max() function is called on the counts.values() dictionary view, which returns the maximum value in the dictionary.
A list comprehension is used to create a list of values in the counts dictionary that have a count equal to the maximum count.
The list of mode values is returned.
