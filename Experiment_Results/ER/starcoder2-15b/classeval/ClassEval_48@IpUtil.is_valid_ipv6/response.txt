Inside the test() method, the IpUtil.is_valid_ipv6() method is invoked. The purpose of this method is to check if a given IP address is a valid IPv6 address.
Inside the is_valid_ipv6() method, the socket.inet_pton() function is used to check if the IP address is a valid IPv6 address.
The socket.inet_pton() function takes two arguments:

socket.AF_INET6: This is a constant that represents the IPv6 address family.
ip_address: This is the IP address to be checked.
If the IP address is a valid IPv6 address, the socket.inet_pton() function will return the IP address in binary format. If the IP address is not a valid IPv6 address, a socket.error exception will be raised.
Inside the try block, the socket.inet_pton() function is called with socket.AF_INET6 and the ip_address argument. If the IP address is a valid IPv6 address, the function will return the IP address in binary format.
Inside the except block, if a socket.error exception is raised, it means that the IP address is not a valid IPv6 address. The function returns False.

            return True
        except socket.error:
            return False

    @staticmethod
    def get_hostname(ip_address):
        try:
            hostname = socket.gethostbyaddr(ip_address)[0]
            return hostname

What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
