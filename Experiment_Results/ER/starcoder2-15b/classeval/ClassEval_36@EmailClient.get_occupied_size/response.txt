Inside the test() method, the get_occupied_size() method is invoked. The purpose of this method is to calculate the total size of all emails in the inbox.
Inside the get_occupied_size() method, the occupied_size variable is initialized to 0.
A for loop iterates over the inbox list, adding the size of each email to the occupied_size variable.
After the loop completes, the method returns occupied_size, which is the total size of all emails in the inbox.

<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method, a LinkedList object is created and assigned to the ll variable.
The add() method is called on the ll object to add the values 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 to the linked list.
The reverse() method is called on the ll object to reverse the order of the elements in the linked list.
After the reverse() method is called, the linked list will contain the values in the reverse order: 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
The ll object is returned from the test() method.
