Inside the test() method, the KappaCalculator.kappa() method is invoked with the following arguments:
testData: A 2D list representing a confusion matrix.
k: An integer representing the number of classes.
Inside the kappa() method, the dataMat variable is initialized to a numpy matrix representation of testData.
The P0 variable is initialized to 0.0.
A for loop iterates from 0 to k (which is 3 in this case), adding the value of dataMat[i, i] to P0.
The xsum variable is initialized to the sum of the rows of dataMat using the numpy sum() function with axis=1.
The ysum variable is initialized to the sum of the columns of dataMat using the numpy sum() function with axis=0.
The sum variable is initialized to the sum of all elements in dataMat using the numpy sum() function.
The Pe variable is calculated as the dot product of ysum and xsum divided by sum squared.
The P0 variable is calculated as P0 divided by sum multiplied by 1.0.
The cohens_coefficient variable is calculated as (P0 - Pe) divided by (1 - Pe).
The method returns cohens_coefficient.

<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method, the KappaCalculator.fleiss_kappa() method is invoked with the following arguments:
testData: A 2D list representing a confusion matrix.
N: An integer representing the number of subjects.
k: An integer representing the number of classes.
n: An integer representing the number of raters.
Inside the fleiss_kappa() method, the dataMat variable is initialized to a numpy matrix representation of testData.
The oneMat variable is initialized to a numpy matrix of ones with shape (k, 1).
The sum variable is initialized to 0.0.
The P0 variable is initialized to 0.0.
A for loop iterates from 0 to N (which is 3 in this case).
Inside the loop, the temp variable is initialized to 0.0.
Another for loop iterates from 0 to k (which is 3 in this case).
Inside the loop, sum is incremented by dataMat[i, j].
temp is increment
