Inside the test() method, the BlackjackGame class is instantiated and assigned to the self.blackjackGame variable.
Inside the BlackjackGame class, the create_deck() method is called, which returns a shuffled deck of cards.
The deck is stored in the self.deck variable.
The length of the deck is returned.

<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
