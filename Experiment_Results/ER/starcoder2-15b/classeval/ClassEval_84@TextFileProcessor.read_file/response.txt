Inside the test() method, a list of file names and corresponding contents are defined.
The files are created and written with the corresponding contents.
An instance of the TextFileProcessor class is created with the first file name as the argument.
The read_file() method is called on the TextFileProcessor instance.
Inside the read_file() method, the file is opened in read mode using the with statement.
The file content is read and returned.
The write_file() method is called on the TextFileProcessor instance with the processed content as the argument.
Inside the write_file() method, the file is opened in write mode using the with statement.
The processed content is written to the file.
The process_file() method is called on the TextFileProcessor instance.
Inside the process_file() method, the read_file() method is called to read the file content.
The content is processed by removing all non-alphabetic characters.
The write_file() method is called with the processed content as the argument.
The processed content is returned.

<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
