Inside the test() method, the Manacher class is instantiated with the input string 'ababaxse'.
The palindromic_length() method is called with the following arguments:
center = 2
diff = 1
string = 'a|b|a|b|a|x|s|e'
Inside the palindromic_length() method, the if statement is evaluated.
The first condition checks if center - diff == -1, which is not true because center = 2 and diff = 1.
The second condition checks if center + diff == len(string), which is not true because center = 2, diff = 1, and len(string) = 8.
The third condition checks if string[center - diff] != string[center + diff], which is not true because string[center - diff] = string[1] = 'b' and string[center + diff] = string[3] = 'b'.
Since none of the conditions are true, the if statement is not executed.
The method returns 0.

<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method, the Manacher class is instantiated with the input string 'ababaxse'.
The palindromic_string() method is called, which returns the longest palindromic substring of the input string.
The method first creates a new string new_input_string by inserting '|' between each character in the input string.
Then, it iterates over the indices of new_input_string using a for loop.
For each index i, it calls the palindromic_length() method with the following arguments:
center = i
diff = 1
string = new_input_string
The palindromic_length() method recursively checks if the characters at center - diff and center + diff are equal.
If they are not equal, it returns 0.
Otherwise, it returns 1 plus the result of a recursive call to palindromic_length() with diff incremented by 1.
The palindromic_length() method is used to determine the length of the longest palindromic substring centered at index i.
The maximum length and the corresponding start index are stored in max_length and start, respectively.
Finally, the longest palindromic substring is extracted from new_input_string and returned.
