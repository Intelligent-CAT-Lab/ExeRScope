Inside the test() method, an instance of the AssessmentSystem class is created and stored in the assessment_system variable.
The add_student() method is called on the assessment_system object, passing in the string "Alice" as the name, the integer 3 as the grade, and the string "Mathematics" as the major.
The add_student() method adds a new student to the assessment_system object's students dictionary, with the key "Alice" and the value being a dictionary with the keys "name", "grade", "major", and "courses".
The return statement returns the value of the "Alice" key in the assessment_system.students dictionary.
<<<Output>>>
{'name': 'Alice', 'grade': 3, 'major': 'Mathematics', 'courses': {}}

<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method, an instance of the AssessmentSystem class is created and stored in the assessment_system variable.
The add_student() method is called three times on the assessment_system object, passing in the strings "Alice", "Bob", and "Charlie" as the names, the integer 3 as the grade, and the string "Mathematics" as the major.
The add_course_score() method is called three times on the assessment_system object, passing in the strings "Alice", "Bob", and "Charlie" as the names, the string "Math" as the course, and the integers 90, 80, and 70 as the scores.
The get_course_average() method is called on the assessment_system object, passing in the string "Math" as the course.
Inside the get_course_average() method, the total and count variables are initialized to 0.
A for loop iterates over the values of the assessment_system.students dictionary. For each student, the if statement checks if the course is in the student's courses dictionary. If it is
