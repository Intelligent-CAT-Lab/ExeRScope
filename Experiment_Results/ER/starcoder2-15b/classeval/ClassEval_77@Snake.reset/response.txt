Inside the test() method, a Snake object is created with the following parameters:
SCREEN_WIDTH = 100
SCREEN_HEIGHT = 100
BLOCK_SIZE = 1
food_position = (51, 51)
The move() method is called with the direction (-1, 0). This means that the snake is moving left.
Inside the move() method, the current position of the snake is retrieved from the positions list.
The new position is calculated by adding the direction to the current position.
If the new position is equal to the food position, the eat_food() method is called.
If the new position is in the positions list (excluding the first two elements), the reset() method is called.
If the new position is not in the positions list, it is added to the beginning of the positions list.
If the length of the positions list is greater than the length of the snake, the last element is removed from the list.
The reset() method is called.
Inside the reset() method, the length of the snake is set to 1, the positions list is set to [(50, 50)], the score is set to 0, and a new food position is generated.
The length of the snake is 1, the first element of the positions list is (50, 50), and the score is 0.

What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
