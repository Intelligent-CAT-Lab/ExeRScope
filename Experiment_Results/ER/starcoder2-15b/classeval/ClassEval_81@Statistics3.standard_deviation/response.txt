Inside the test() method, the standard_deviation() method is invoked with the argument [1, 1, 1].
Inside the standard_deviation() method, the length of the data is calculated using len(data). Since data is [1, 1, 1], the length is 3.
If the length is less than 2, the method returns None. Since the length is 3, this condition is not met.
The mean value of the data is calculated using the mean() method. The mean() method returns the sum of the data divided by the length of the data. Since the sum of the data is 3 and the length is 3, the mean value is 1.
The variance is calculated by summing the squared difference between each data point and the mean value, and dividing by the length of the data minus 1. Since the length of the data is 3, the denominator is 2.
The variance is 0, so the standard deviation is 0.
