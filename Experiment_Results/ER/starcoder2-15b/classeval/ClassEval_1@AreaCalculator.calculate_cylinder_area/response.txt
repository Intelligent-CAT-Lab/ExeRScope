Inside the test() method, an AreaCalculator object is created with a radius of 2.
The calculate_cylinder_area() method is called with a height of 2.
Inside the calculate_cylinder_area() method, the area of the cylinder is calculated using the formula:
2 * pi * radius * (radius + height)
In this case, radius = 2 and height = 2.
The math.pi constant is used to represent the value of pi.
The area of the cylinder is calculated as:
2 * pi * 2 * (2 + 2) = 2 * pi * 4 = 8 * pi
The method returns the calculated area.
<<<Output>>>
8 * pi

    def calculate_cylinder_area(self, height):
        return 2 * math.pi * self.radius * (self.radius + height)

    def calculate_sector_area(self, angle):
        return self.radius ** 2 * angle / 2

    def calculate_annulus_area(self, inner_radius, outer_radius):
        return math.pi * (outer_radius ** 2 - inner_radius ** 2)
class Test(unittest.TestCase):
    def test(self):

<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The math.pi constant is used to represent the value of pi.
The area of the annulus is calculated as:
