Inside the test() method, a CamelCaseMap object is created and assigned to the camelize_map variable.
The __setitem__() method is called on the camelize_map object, passing 'first_name' as the key and 'John' as the value.
The __delitem__() method is called on the camelize_map object, passing 'firstName' as the key.
The __delitem__() method calls the _convert_key() method, passing 'firstName' as the key.
The _convert_key() method calls the _to_camel_case() method, passing 'firstName' as the key.
The _to_camel_case() method splits the key into parts using the split() method, separating the string by underscores.
The _to_camel_case() method returns the first part of the key (which is 'first') concatenated with the rest of the parts, where each part is capitalized using the title() method.
The __delitem__() method deletes the converted key from the _data dictionary.
The __delitem__() method returns None.
The test() method returns None.

    def __init__(self, a, b):
        self.a = a
        self.b = b

    def add(self):

        return self.a - self.b

    def multiply(self):
        return self.a * self.b

    def divide(self):
        return self.a / self.b
class Test(unittest.TestCase):
    def test(self):
            calculator = Calculator(10, 5)
            return calculator.add()
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method, a Calculator object is created and assigned to the calculator variable. The constructor is called with two arguments, 10 and 5, which are assigned to the a and b attributes of the object.
The add() method is called on the calculator object, which returns the sum of the a and b attributes.
The test() method returns 15.
