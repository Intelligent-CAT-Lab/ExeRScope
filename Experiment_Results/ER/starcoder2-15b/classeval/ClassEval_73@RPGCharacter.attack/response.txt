Inside the test() method, two RPGCharacter objects are created: character1 and character2.
character1 is initialized with the name "John", hp = 100, attack_power = 20, defense = 10, and level = 1.
character2 is initialized with the name "Enemy", hp = 100, attack_power = 15, defense = 5, and level = 1.
The attack() method is called on character1, passing character2 as the argument.
Inside the attack() method, the damage is calculated as the difference between the attack_power and the defense of the other_character.
The damage is then subtracted from the hp of the other_character.
