Inside the test() method, a Chat object is created and assigned to the chat variable.
The users attribute of the chat object is set to a dictionary with a single key-value pair: 'John': [].
The add_user() method is called with the argument 'Mary'.
Inside the add_user() method, the username argument is checked to see if it is already in the users dictionary.
Since 'Mary' is not in the users dictionary, the username is added as a key with an empty list as the value.
The method returns True to indicate that the user was added successfully.
The users attribute of the chat object is returned.
<<<Output>>>
(True, {'John': [], 'Mary': []})

<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Inside the test() method, a Calculator object is created and assigned to the calculator variable.
The Calculator object is initialized with two arguments: 10 and 5.
The add() method is called on the calculator object.
Inside the add() method, the a and b attributes of the calculator object are added together and returned.
The subtract() method is called on the calculator object.
Inside the subtract() method, the a and b attributes of the calculator object are subtracted and returned.
The multiply() method is called on the calculator object.
Inside the multiply() method, the a and b attributes of the calculator object are multiplied and returned.
The divide() method is called on the calculator object.
Inside the divide() method, the a and b attributes of the calculator object are divided and returned.
