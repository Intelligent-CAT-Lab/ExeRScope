Inside the test() method, a DecryptionUtils object is created with the key 'key'.
The vigenere_decipher() method is called on the object with the argument 'ifmmp'.
Inside the vigenere_decipher() method, the decrypted_text variable is initialized to an empty string.
The key_index variable is initialized to 0.
A for loop iterates over each character in the ciphertext argument.
Inside the for loop, if the current character is an alphabetic character, the shift variable is calculated based on the current character in the key.
The decrypted_char variable is calculated based on the current character and the shift.
The decrypted_char is added to the decrypted_text variable.
If the current character is not an alphabetic character, it is added to the decrypted_text variable.
After the for loop, the decrypted_text variable is returned.

        self.a = a
        self.b = b

    def add(self):

        return self.a - self.b

    def multiply(self):
        return self.a * self.b

    def divide(self):
        return self.a / self.b
class Test(unittest.TestCase):
    def test(self):
            c = Calculator(10, 5)
            return c.add()
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method, a Calculator object is created with the arguments 10 and 5.
The add() method is called on the object, which returns the sum of the a and b attributes of the object.
In this case, the a attribute is 10 and the b attribute is 5, so the sum is 15.
<<<Output>>>
15

Inside the test() method, a Calculator object is created with the arguments 10 and 5.
The subtract() method is called on the object, which returns the difference of the a and b attributes of the object.
In this case, the a attribute is 10 and the b attribute is 5, so the difference is 5.
<<<Output>>>
