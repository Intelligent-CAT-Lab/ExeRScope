Inside the test() method, the BitStatusUtil() class is instantiated. This creates an instance of the BitStatusUtil class, which is assigned to the variable bit_status_util.
The add() method is then called on the bit_status_util instance, passing in 0 and 0 as arguments.
Inside the add() method, the check() method is called, passing in a list containing the arguments states and stat.
Inside the check() method, a for loop iterates over the elements in the args list. For each element, the following checks are performed:
If the element is less than 0, a ValueError is raised with the message "{arg} must be greater than or equal to 0".
If the element is not even, a ValueError is raised with the message "{arg} not even".
After the loop completes, the method returns None.
The add() method then returns the result of the bitwise OR operation between states and stat. Since states and stat are both 0, the result of the OR operation is also 0.

The has() method then returns the result of the bitwise AND operation between states and stat. Since states and stat are both 0, the result of the AND operation is also 0.
The remove() method then checks if the result of the has() method is equal to stat. Since the result of the has() method is 0 and stat is also 0, the condition is true.
The remove() method then returns the result of the bitwise XOR operation between states and stat. Since states and stat are both 0, the result of the XOR operation is also 0.
