Inside the test() method, a new RPGCharacter object is created with the name "John", hp = 100, attack_power = 20, defense = 10, and level = 1.
The level_up() method is called on the character object.
Inside the level_up() method, the level is increased by 1, the exp is reset to 0, the hp is increased by 20, the attack_power is increased by 5, and the defense is increased by 5.
After the level_up() method completes, the test() method returns the level, exp, hp, attack_power, and defense of the character object.

<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method, a new RPGCharacter object is created with the name "John", hp = 100, attack_power = 20, defense = 10, and level = 1.
The gain_exp(100) method is called on the character object, passing in the amount of experience points to gain.
Inside the gain_exp() method, a while loop is used to process the experience points.
The loop continues while the amount variable is not equal to 0.
Inside the loop, if the current experience points plus the amount to gain is greater than or equal to the current level multiplied by 100, the amount is reduced by the difference between the current level multiplied by 100 and the current experience points, and the level_up() method is called.
If the current experience points plus the amount to gain is less than the current level multiplied by 100, the amount is added to the current experience points, and the amount variable is set to 0.
After the loop completes, the test() method returns the level, exp, hp, attack_power, and defense of the character object.
