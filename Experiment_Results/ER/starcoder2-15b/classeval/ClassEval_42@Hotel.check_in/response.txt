Inside the test() method, a Hotel object is created with the name 'Test Hotel' and the available rooms {'single': 3, 'double': 2}.
The booked_rooms dictionary is then set to {'single': {'guest 1': 2}, 'double': {'guest 2': 1}}.
The check_in() method is called with the arguments 'double', 1, and 'guest 1'.
Inside the check_in() method, the room_type 'double' is checked to see if it is in the booked_rooms dictionary. It is, so the next condition is checked.
The name 'guest 1' is checked to see if it is in the booked_rooms['double'] dictionary. It is not, so the method returns False.
<<<Output>>>
(False, {'single': {'guest 1': 2}, 'double': {'guest 2': 1}})

<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
