Inside the test() method, the SQLGenerator class is instantiated with the table name 'table1'.
The select_by_age_range() method is called with the arguments 50 and 60.
Inside the select_by_age_range() method, the condition variable is set to a string that represents a condition for age between 50 and 60.
The select() method is called with the condition argument set to the condition variable.
Inside the select() method, the fields argument is set to None, so the fields variable is set to the string "*".
The sql variable is set to a string that represents a SELECT statement with the fields and table_name variables.
The condition argument is not None, so the sql variable is appended with a WHERE clause using the condition variable.
The sql variable is appended with a semicolon.
The sql variable is returned.
<<<Output>>>
SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE age BETWEEN 50 AND 60;

<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
