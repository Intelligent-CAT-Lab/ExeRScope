Inside the test() method, the get_minutes() method is invoked. The purpose of this method is to calculate the difference in minutes between two given times.
The method takes two parameters: string_time1 and string_time2. These parameters represent the two times to be compared.
Inside the get_minutes() method, the string_to_datetime() method is invoked twice to convert the string representations of the times into datetime objects.
The datetime_to_string() method is then invoked to convert the datetime objects back into string representations.
The difference between the two times is calculated by subtracting time1 from time2. The difference is then divided by 60 to convert it from seconds to minutes.
The result is rounded to the nearest integer using the round() function.

        self.a = a
        self.b = b

    def add(self):

        return self.a - self.b

    def divide(self):
        return self.a / self.b

    def test(self):
            calculator = Calculator(10, 5)

<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method, the Calculator class is instantiated with two arguments: 10 and 5.
The divide() method is then called on the calculator object, which returns the result of dividing the two numbers.
In this case, the result is 2.0, which is the quotient of 10 divided by 5.
<<<Output>>>
2.0
