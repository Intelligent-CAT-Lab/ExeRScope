Inside the test() method, the _save_cookies() method is invoked.
The purpose of this method is to save the cookies to a file.
Inside the _save_cookies() method, the cookies are saved to a file using the json.dump() function.
The json.dump() function takes two arguments: the data to be saved and the file object to write to.
In this case, the data to be saved is self.cookies, which is a dictionary containing the cookies.
The file object is obtained by opening the file specified by self.cookies_file in write mode using the open() function.
The with statement is used to ensure that the file is closed after the data is written.
If the file is successfully written, the method returns True. If an error occurs, the method returns False.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import unittest

class Calculator:
    def __init__(self, a, b):
        self.a = a
        self.b = b

    def add(self):
        return self.a + self.b

    def subtract(self):
        return self.a - self.b

    def multiply(self):
        return self.a * self.b

    def divide(self):
        return self.a / self.b
class Test(unittest.TestCase):
    def test(self):
            calculator = Calculator(10, 5)
            return calculator.add()
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method, a Calculator object is created with a = 10 and b = 5.
The add() method is then called on the calculator object, which returns the sum of a and b, which is 15.
<<<Output>>>
15
