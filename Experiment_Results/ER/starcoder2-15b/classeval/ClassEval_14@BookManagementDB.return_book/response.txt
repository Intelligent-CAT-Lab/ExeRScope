Inside the test() method, the BookManagementDB class is instantiated with the database name "test.db".
The connection to the database is established using the sqlite3 module.
A book is added to the database using the add_book() method. The title of the book is "Book to Return" and the author is "".
The borrow_book() method is called to mark the book as borrowed. The book_id is 1, which is the ID of the book that was just added.
The return_book() method is called to mark the book as available again. The book_id is 1, which is the ID of the book that was just added.
The cursor is used to execute a SQL query to select the available column from the books table where the id is 1.
The fetchone() method is called to retrieve the first row of the result set.
The available column of the first row is returned.

<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method, a LinkedList object is instantiated and assigned to the linked_list variable.
The insert() method is called five times to add five nodes to the linked list. The data values of the nodes are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively.
The delete() method is called to delete the node with the data value of 3.
The print_list() method is called to print the data values of all the nodes in the linked list.
