Inside the test() method, the get_gpa() method is invoked with the argument 'Bob'.
The get_gpa() method checks if 'Bob' is in the students dictionary. Since 'Bob' is not in the dictionary, the method returns None.

<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method, the get_course_average() method is invoked with the argument 'Mathematics'.
The get_course_average() method initializes the total and count variables to 0.
The method iterates over the values of the students dictionary. For each student, it checks if 'Mathematics' is in the student's courses. If it is, it adds the score of 'Mathematics' to the total and increments the count by 1.
Since 'Mathematics' is in the student's courses, the score of 'Mathematics' is added to the total and the count is incremented by 1.
After the loop completes, the method returns the average of the total and count. Since the total is 90 and the count is 1, the average is 90.
<<<Output>>>
90
