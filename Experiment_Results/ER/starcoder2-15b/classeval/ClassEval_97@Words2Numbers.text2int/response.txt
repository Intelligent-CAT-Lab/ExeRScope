Inside the test() method, the Words2Numbers() class is instantiated and assigned to the w2n variable.
Inside the Words2Numbers class, the __init__() method is called, which initializes the class variables.
The numwords dictionary is initialized with the units, tens, and scales lists.
The ordinal_words dictionary is initialized with the ordinal numbers and their corresponding values.
The ordinal_endings list is initialized with tuples of ordinal endings and their replacements.
The text2int() method is called on the w2n object with the argument 'one million and eleven'.
Inside the text2int() method, the textnum argument is modified by replacing '-' with ' '.
The current and result variables are initialized to 0.
The curstring variable is initialized to an empty string.
The onnumber variable is initialized to False.
The textnum argument is split into a list of words using the split() method.
A for loop iterates over each word in the list.
If the word is in the ordinal_words dictionary, the scale and increment variables are assigned the corresponding values from the dictionary.
The current variable is updated by multiplying it by scale and adding increment.
The onnumber variable is set to True.
If the word is not in the ordinal_words dictionary, the for loop continues.
For each ending and replacement tuple in the ordinal_endings list, if the word ends with the ending, the word is modified by replacing the ending with the replacement.
If the word is not in the numwords dictionary, the if statement is executed.
If onnumber is True, curstring is updated by adding the string representation of result + current followed by a space.
curstring is updated by adding word followed by a space.
result and current are set to 0.
onnumber is set to False.
If the word is in the numwords dictionary, the scale and increment variables are assigned the corresponding values from the dictionary.
current is updated by multiplying it by scale and adding increment.
If scale is greater than 100, result is updated by adding current and current is set to 0.
onnumber is set to True.
If onnumber is True, curstring is updated by adding the string representation of result + current.
curstring is returned.
