Inside the test() method, the TriCalculator() class is instantiated and assigned to the tricalculator variable.
The tricalculator.sin(0) method is invoked, passing 0 as the argument.
Inside the sin() method, the x variable is set to 0, and the g variable is initialized to 0.
The t variable is set to x, which is 0.
The n variable is set to 1.
A while loop is entered, and the condition fabs(t) >= 1e-15 is evaluated. fabs() is a function that returns the absolute value of a number. 1e-15 is a floating-point number that represents 10 to the power of -15.
Since fabs(0) is 0, and 0 is not greater than or equal to 1e-15, the loop exits.
The method returns g, which is 0.

<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method, the Calculator class is instantiated with the arguments 10 and 2, and assigned to the calculator variable.
The calculator.div() method is invoked.
Inside the div() method, the a and b variables are set to 10 and 2, respectively.
The method returns a / b, which is 10 / 2, or 5.
