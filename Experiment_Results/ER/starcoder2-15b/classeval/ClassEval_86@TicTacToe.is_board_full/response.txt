Inside the test() method, a TicTacToe object is created with the default size of 3.
The is_board_full() method is called on the ttt object.
Inside the is_board_full() method, a for loop iterates over each row in the board.
Inside the loop, the ' ' in row expression checks if the string ' ' is in the current row.
Since the board is initialized with empty spaces, the ' ' in row expression will return True for each row.
The loop continues until all rows are checked.
Since all rows contain ' ', the method returns False.
<<<Output>>>
False

Consider the following code:

    def __init__(self, N=3):
        self.board = [[' ' for _ in range(N)] for _ in range(3)]

            self.board[row][col] = self.current_player
            self.current_player = 'O' if self.current_player == 'X' else 'X'
            return True

<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method, a TicTacToe object is created with the default size of 3.
The make_move() method is called on the ttt object with the arguments (0, 0).
Inside the make_move() method, the if statement checks if the board[0][0] is equal to ' '.
Since the board is initialized with empty spaces, the if statement will be True.
The board[0][0] is set to the current_player, which is 'X'.
The current_player is set to 'O'.
The method returns True.
The make_move() method is called again with the arguments (0, 1).
The if statement is True, and the board[0][1] is set to 'O'.
The current_player is set to 'X'.
The method returns True.
The make_move() method is called again with the arguments (0, 2).
The if statement is True, and the board[0][2] is set to 'X'.
The current_player is set to 'O'.
The method returns True.
The check_winner() method is called on the ttt object.
Inside the check_winner() method, a for loop iterates over each row in the board.
The first row is ['X', 'O', 'X'].
The if statement checks if row[0] == row[1] == row[2] != ' '.
Since row[0] == row[1] == row[2] is True and row[0] != ' ' is True, the if statement is True.
The method returns row[0], which is 'X'.
<<<Output>>>
'X'
