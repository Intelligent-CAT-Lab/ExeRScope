Inside the test() method, a customer dictionary is created with the name '' and fidelity 1800.
A cart list is created with two items, each with a product name, quantity, and price.
A DiscountStrategy object is created with the customer, cart, and promotion (FidelityPromo) as arguments.
The promotion attribute of the order object is set to FidelityPromo.
The total() method is called on the order object, which calculates the total price of the items in the cart.
The due() method is called on the order object, which calculates the total price after applying the promotion.
The FidelityPromo() method is called on the order object, which calculates the discount based on the customer's fidelity.
The discount is calculated as 0.05 * total if the customer's fidelity is greater than or equal to 1000, otherwise it is 0.
The due() method returns the total price after applying the discount.
