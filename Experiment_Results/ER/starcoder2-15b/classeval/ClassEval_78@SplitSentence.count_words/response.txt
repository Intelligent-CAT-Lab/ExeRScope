Inside the test() method, the count_words() method is invoked with the argument "abc def bbb1".
Inside the count_words() method, the sentence argument is first modified using the re.sub() function. This function replaces all non-alphabetic characters with an empty string.
The modified sentence is then split into a list of words using the split() method.
The length of the list is returned as the result of the count_words() method.

What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Inside the process_text_file() method, the sentences_string argument is first split into a list of sentences using the split_sentences() method.
The count_words() method is then called for each sentence in the list.
The maximum count of words in a sentence is stored in the max_count variable.
The maximum count is returned as the result of the process_text_file() method.

Inside the test() method, the split_sentences() method is invoked with the argument "abc def bbb1".
Inside the split_sentences() method, the re.split() function is used to split the sentences_string argument into a list of sentences.
The regular expression r'(?<!\w\.\w.)(?<![A-Z][a-z]\.)(?<=\.|\?)\s' is used to split the string based on the following conditions:
(?<!\w\.\w.) - Negative lookbehind to ensure that the period is not followed by another period or a letter.
(?<![A-Z][a-z]\.)(?<=\.|\?) - Negative lookbehind to ensure that the period or question mark is not preceded by an uppercase letter followed by a lowercase letter and a period.
\s - Matches any whitespace character.
The resulting list of sentences is returned as the result of the split_sentences() method.
