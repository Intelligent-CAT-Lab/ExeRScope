Inside the test() method, a MusicPlayer object is created and assigned to the musicPlayer variable.
The playlist attribute of the musicPlayer object is set to ["song1", "song2"].
The current_song attribute of the musicPlayer object is set to "song2".
The shuffle() method is called on the musicPlayer object.
Inside the shuffle() method, the playlist attribute of the musicPlayer object is checked to see if it is not empty.
If the playlist is not empty, the random module is imported and the shuffle() function is called on the playlist attribute of the musicPlayer object.
The shuffle() function randomly shuffles the elements of the playlist attribute of the musicPlayer object.
The return value of the shuffle() method is True.

<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method, a MusicPlayer object is created and assigned to the musicPlayer variable.
The playlist attribute of the musicPlayer object is set to ["song1", "song2"].
The current_song attribute of the musicPlayer object is set to "song2".
The previous_song() method is called on the musicPlayer object.
Inside the previous_song() method, the current_song attribute of the musicPlayer object is checked to see if it is not None.
If the current_song attribute is not None, the index of the current_song in the playlist attribute is obtained using the index() method.
If the index of the current_song is greater than 0, the current_song attribute is set to the previous song in the playlist attribute.
The return value of the previous_song() method is True.
