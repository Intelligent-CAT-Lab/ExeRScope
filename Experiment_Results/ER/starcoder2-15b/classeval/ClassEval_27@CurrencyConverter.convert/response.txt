Inside the test() method, the CurrencyConverter class is instantiated.
The convert() method is called with the arguments 64, '???', and 'USD'.
The from_currency parameter is '???', which is not a valid currency code.
The if statement checks if from_currency is equal to to_currency. Since from_currency is not equal to to_currency, the if statement is not executed.
The if statement checks if from_currency is in the rates dictionary. Since from_currency is not in the rates dictionary, the if statement is not executed.
The if statement checks if to_currency is in the rates dictionary. Since to_currency is in the rates dictionary, the if statement is executed.
The from_rate variable is assigned the value of the rates dictionary entry for from_currency. Since from_currency is not in the rates dictionary, from_rate is assigned the value False.
The to_rate variable is assigned the value of the rates dictionary entry for to_currency. Since to_currency is in the rates dictionary, to_rate is assigned the value 1.0.
The converted_amount variable is assigned the value of (amount / from_rate) * to_rate. Since from_rate is False, the expression (amount / from_rate) raises a TypeError exception.
The convert() method returns converted_amount, which is False.

<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
