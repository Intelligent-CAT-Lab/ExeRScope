Inside the test() method, the MovieTicketDB class is instantiated with the database name 'test_database.db'.
The create_table() method is called to create a table named 'tickets' in the database.
The insert_ticket() method is called to insert a ticket into the database with the following information:
movie_name: 'Avengers: Endgame'
theater_name: 'Cinema 1'
seat_number: 'A1'
customer_name: ''
The search_tickets_by_customer() method is called to search for tickets in the database that belong to the customer ''.
The delete_ticket() method is called to delete the ticket with the id ticket_id from the database.
The search_tickets_by_customer() method is called again to search for tickets in the database that belong to the customer ''.
The length of the returned list of tickets is returned.
