Inside the test() method, the ZipFileProcessor class is instantiated with the zip file name 'example.zip'.
The extract_all() method is called with the output directory 'output_directory'.
The extract_all() method attempts to extract all files from the zip file into the output directory.
If the extraction is successful, the method returns True.
If the extraction fails, the method returns False.
The os.remove() function is used to remove the zip file and the example file.
The os.rmdir() function is used to remove the test folder.

<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method, the FileManager class is instantiated with the file path 'test_folder/test_file.txt'.
The create_file() method is called, which attempts to create a new file at the specified file path.
If the file creation is successful, the method returns True.
If the file creation fails, the method returns False.
The read_file() method is called, which attempts to read the contents of the file.
If the file reading is successful, the method returns the contents of the file.
If the file reading fails, the method returns None.
The delete_file() method is called, which attempts to delete the file.
If the file deletion is successful, the method returns True.
If the file deletion fails, the method returns False.
The os.rmdir() function is used to remove the test folder.
