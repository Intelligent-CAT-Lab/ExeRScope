Inside the test() method, the process_data() method is invoked with an empty list as an argument.
Inside the process_data() method, the words_list variable is initialized to an empty list.
A for loop iterates over the string_list argument, which is an empty list in this case.
Inside the loop, the processed_string variable is set to the result of calling the re.sub() function with the following arguments:
r'[^a-zA-Z\s]': This is a regular expression that matches any character that is not an English letter or a whitespace character.
'' (empty string): This is the replacement string, which means that any non-English letters or whitespace characters will be removed from the string.
string.lower(): This is the string to be processed, which is an empty string in this case.
The processed_string variable is set to an empty string after the re.sub() function is called.
The words variable is set to the result of calling the split() method on the processed_string variable, which is an empty string.
The words variable is set to an empty list after the split() method is called.
The words variable is appended to the words_list variable.
After the loop completes, the words_list variable is returned, which is an empty list.

<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Inside the test() method, the process() method is invoked with a list of two strings as an argument.
Inside the process() method, the process_data() method is called with the same argument.
Inside the process_data() method, the words_list variable is initialized to an empty list.
A for loop iterates over the string_list argument, which is a list of two strings in this case.
Inside the loop, the processed_string variable is set to the result of calling the re.sub() function with the following arguments:

'' (empty string): This is the replacement string, which means that any non-English letters or whitespace characters will be removed from the string.
string.lower(): This is the string to be processed, which is a string in the string_list argument.
The processed_string variable is set to a lowercase string with all non-English letters and whitespace characters removed.
The words variable is set to the result of calling the split() method on the processed_string variable, which splits the string into a list of words.
The words variable is appended to the words_list variable.
After the loop completes, the words_list variable is returned, which is a list of lists of words.
The calculate_word_frequency() method is called with the words_list variable as an argument.
