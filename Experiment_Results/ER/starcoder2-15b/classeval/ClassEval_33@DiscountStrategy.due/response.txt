Inside the test() method, a customer dictionary is created with the name '' and fidelity 900.
A cart list is created with two items, each with a product name, quantity, and price.
A DiscountStrategy object is created with the customer, cart, and FidelityPromo promotion.
The due() method is called on the order object, which returns the total amount due after applying the promotion.
Inside the due() method, if the promotion is None, discount is set to 0.
If the promotion is not None, the promotion is called with the order object as an argument, and the result is assigned to discount.
In this case, the promotion is FidelityPromo, so the FidelityPromo() method is called with the order object as an argument.
Inside the FidelityPromo() method, if the order's customer's fidelity is greater than or equal to 1000, the total amount is multiplied by 0.05 and returned.
If the fidelity is less than 1000, 0 is returned.
In this case, the customer's fidelity is 900, so 0 is returned.
The discount is subtracted from the total amount, and the result is returned.

<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
