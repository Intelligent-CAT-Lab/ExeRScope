Inside the test() method, the EightPuzzle class is instantiated with the initial_state [[2, 3, 4], [5, 0, 1], [6, 8, 7]].
The move() method is called with the initial_state and the direction 'left' as arguments.
Inside the move() method, the find_blank() method is called with the state argument.
Inside the find_blank() method, a nested for loop iterates over the state and finds the position of the blank tile (represented by 0).
The position of the blank tile is returned as a tuple (i, j).
The move() method continues by creating a new_state by copying the state using list comprehension.
If the direction is 'up', the blank tile is moved up by swapping the blank tile with the tile above it.
If the direction is 'down', the blank tile is moved down by swapping the blank tile with the tile below it.
If the direction is 'left', the blank tile is moved left by swapping the blank tile with the tile to its left.
If the direction is 'right', the blank tile is moved right by swapping the blank tile with the tile to its right.
The new_state is returned.
The test() method continues by calling the move() method with the initial_state and the direction 'left' as arguments.
The result of the move() method is assigned to the result variable.
The expected value is assigned to the expected variable.
