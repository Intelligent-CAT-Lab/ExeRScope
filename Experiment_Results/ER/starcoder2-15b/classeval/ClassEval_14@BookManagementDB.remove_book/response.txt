Inside the test() method, the BookManagementDB class is instantiated with the database name "test.db".
The connection and cursor attributes are initialized using the sqlite3 module.
A book is added to the database using the add_book() method. The title is "Book to Remove" and the author is "".
The remove_book() method is called with the book_id of 1, which is the ID of the book that was just added.
The cursor is used to execute a SQL query to select all books with an ID of 1.
The fetchone() method is called on the cursor to retrieve the first result from the query.
The result is returned.

<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Inside the test() method, a Calculator object is instantiated with the values 10 and 5.
The add() method is called on the calculator object, which returns the sum of the two values.
The result of the addition is returned.
