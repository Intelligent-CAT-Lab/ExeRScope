Inside the test() method, a MahjongConnect object is created with a board size of [4, 4] and a list of icons ['a', 'b', 'c']. The board is then set to a specific configuration using the board attribute.
The has_path() method is then called with the positions (0, 0) and (1, 1) as arguments.
Inside the has_path() method, a set called visited is initialized to keep track of visited positions. A stack is created and the starting position (0, 0) is pushed onto it.
The while loop iterates while the stack is not empty. Inside the loop, the current position is popped from the stack and checked if it is equal to the target position (1, 1). If it is, the method returns True.
If the current position is already in the visited set, it is skipped. Otherwise, it is added to the visited set and the x and y coordinates are extracted.
The for loop iterates over the adjacent positions (up, down, left, right) and checks if the new position is within the board boundaries and not already visited. If it is, and the icon at that position is the same as the current position, it is added to the stack.
After the loop completes, the method returns False, indicating that there is no valid path between the two positions.
