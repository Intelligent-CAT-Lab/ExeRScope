Inside the test() method, a BinaryDataProcessor object is created with the binary_string "01101000011011010110001001101111".
The clean_non_binary_chars() method is called, which removes any characters that are not '0' or '1' from the binary_string. In this case, the binary_string remains unchanged.
The calculate_binary_info() method is called, which calculates the percentage of zeroes, ones, and the total length of the binary_string.
The convert_to_ascii() method is called, which converts the binary_string to ASCII.
Inside the convert_to_ascii() method, a bytearray is created to store the converted bytes.
A for loop iterates over the binary_string, taking 8-bit chunks at a time.
For each chunk, the binary value is converted to a decimal using int(byte, 2).
The decimal value is appended to the bytearray.
After the loop completes, the bytearray is decoded using the ASCII encoding, and the resulting string is returned.

<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
