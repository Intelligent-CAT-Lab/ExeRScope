Inside the test() method, a Calculator object is created and assigned to the calculator variable.
The apply_operator() method is called with two arguments: operand_stack and operator_stack.
The operand_stack is a list containing the numbers 1, 2, and 3.
The operator_stack is a list containing the strings '+' and '*'.
Inside the apply_operator() method, the operator variable is assigned the last element of the operator_stack list.
The if statement checks if the operator is equal to '^'.
Since the operator is not equal to '^', the else block is executed.
The operand2 variable is assigned the last element of the operand_stack list.
The operand1 variable is assigned the second-to-last element of the operand_stack list.
The result variable is assigned the value of the operator function applied to operand1 and operand2.
The result is appended to the operand_stack list.
The operand_stack and operator_stack are returned.

<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
