Inside the test() method, an IPAddress object is created with the IP address "10.10.10.10".
The is_valid() method is called on the IPAddress object.
Inside the is_valid() method, the ip_address attribute of the IPAddress object is split into octets using the split() method.
The split() method takes a string as an argument and returns a list of strings. In this case, the string is '.' and the ip_address attribute is split into a list of strings based on the '.' character.
If the length of the octets list is not equal to 4, the method returns False.
If the length of the octets list is equal to 4, a for loop iterates over each octet in the octets list.
Inside the for loop, the octet is checked to see if it is a digit using the isdigit() method. If it is not a digit, the method returns False.
If the octet is a digit, it is converted to an integer using the int() function.
If the integer representation of the octet is less than 0 or greater than 255, the method returns False.
If all of the above conditions are met, the method returns True.
After the for loop completes, the method returns True.
The get_octets() method is called on the IPAddress object.
Inside the get_octets() method, if the is_valid() method returns True, the ip_address attribute of the IPAddress object is split into octets using the split() method.
If the is_valid() method returns False, an empty list is returned.
After the get_octets() method completes, the method returns the list of octets.
<<<Output>>>
['10', '10', '10', '10']

Consider the following code:

        self.ip_address = ip_address

    def is_valid(self):

        if len(octets) != 4:
            return False
        for octet in octets:
            if not octet.isdigit() or int(octet) < 0 or int(octet) > 255:
                return False
        return True

    def get_octets(self):
        if self.is_valid():
            return self.ip_address.split('.')
        else:

    def get_binary(self):
        if self.is_valid():
            binary_octets = []
            for octet in self.get_octets():
                binary_octets.append(format(int(octet), '08b'))
            return '.'.join(binary_octets)
        else:
            return ''
class Test(unittest.TestCase):
    def test(self):
            ipaddress = IPAddress("10.10.10.10")
            return ipaddress.get_binary()

<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
