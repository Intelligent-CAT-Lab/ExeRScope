Inside the test() method, the CamelCaseMap._to_camel_case('first_name') method is invoked. The purpose of this method is to convert a string from snake_case to camelCase. In this case, the input string is 'first_name'.
Inside the _to_camel_case() method, the key parameter is assigned to the variable key.
The method then checks if the key is an instance of the str class using isinstance(key, str). If it is, it proceeds to the next step.
The method splits the key string on the underscore character using key.split('_'). This results in a list of strings, where each string represents a word in the original string.
The method then returns the first word in the list (parts[0]) concatenated with the rest of the words, where each word is capitalized using ''.join(part.title() for part in parts[1:]).
In this case, the input string is 'first_name', which is split into ['first', 'name']. The first word is 'first', and the rest of the words are capitalized to 'Name'. The method then returns 'firstName'.

<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method, a LinkedList object is created and assigned to the variable ll.
The add() method is called three times on ll, passing in the values 1, 2, and 3 respectively. This adds those values to the linked list.
The remove() method is called on ll, passing in the value 2. This removes the node with the value 2 from the linked list.
The __iter__() method is called on ll, which returns an iterator that iterates over the values in the linked list.
The list comprehension [value for value in ll] iterates over the values in the linked list and returns a list containing those values.
<<<Output>>>
