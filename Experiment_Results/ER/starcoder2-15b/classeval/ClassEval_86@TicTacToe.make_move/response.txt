Inside the test() method, a TicTacToe object is created with the default size of 3.
The current_player attribute of the object is initialized to 'X'.
The make_move() method is called with the arguments (0, 0). This places an 'X' on the board at position (0, 0).
The current_player attribute is set to 'O'.
The make_move() method is called with the arguments (0, 1). This places an 'O' on the board at position (0, 1).
The current_player attribute is set to 'X'.
The make_move() method is called with the arguments (0, 0). This places an 'X' on the board at position (0, 0), but the position is already occupied, so the method returns False.
The current_player attribute is still 'X'.
<<<Output>>>
('X', True, True, False, 'X')

<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
