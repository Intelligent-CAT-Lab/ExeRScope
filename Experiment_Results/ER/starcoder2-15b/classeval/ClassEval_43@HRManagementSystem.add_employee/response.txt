Inside the test() method, the HRManagementSystem class is instantiated and assigned to the hr_system variable.
The add_employee() method is called three times with different arguments.
The first call: hr_system.add_employee(1, '', 'Manager', 'HR', 5000)
The second call: hr_system.add_employee(2, '', 'Manager', 'HR', 5000)
The third call: hr_system.add_employee(1, '', 'Manager', 'HR', 5000)
Inside the add_employee() method, the employee_id is checked to see if it already exists in the employees dictionary.
If the employee_id is not in the employees dictionary, a new entry is created in the employees dictionary with the employee_id as the key and a dictionary containing the employee's information as the value.
The employee_id is added to the employees dictionary and the method returns True.
If the employee_id is already in the employees dictionary, the method returns False.
The third call to add_employee() with the same employee_id as the first call returns False, indicating that the employee_id already exists in the employees dictionary.
The employees dictionary is then printed, showing the employee_id and the employee's information.
<<<Output>>>
(True, True, False, {1: {'name': '', 'position': 'Manager', 'department': 'HR', 'salary': 5000}})

Consider the following code:

        self.age = age

<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method, an instance of the Employee class is created with the name 'John', age 30, and salary 5000.
The get_name(), get_age(), and get_salary() methods are called, respectively, to retrieve the name, age, and salary of the employee.
The set_name(), set_age(), and set_salary() methods are called, respectively, to set the name, age, and salary of the employee to 'Jane', 25, and 6000.
The get_name(), get_age(), and get_salary() methods are called again, respectively, to retrieve the updated name, age, and salary of the employee.
<<<Output>>>
('John', 30, 5000, None, None, None, 'Jane', 25, 6000)
