Inside the test() method, the process_text_file() method is invoked with the argument "Mr. Smith is a teacher. Yes 1 2 3 4 5 6.".
Inside the process_text_file() method, the split_sentences() method is invoked with the argument sentences_string, which is "Mr. Smith is a teacher. Yes 1 2 3 4 5 6.".
Inside the split_sentences() method, the re.split() function is used to split the sentences_string into a list of sentences. The regular expression r'(?<!\w\.\w.)(?<![A-Z][a-z]\.)(?<=\.|\?)\s' is used to split the string based on the following conditions:

(?<!\w\.\w.) - Negative lookbehind to ensure that the period is not followed by another period or a letter.
(?<![A-Z][a-z]\.)(?<=\.|\?) - Negative lookbehind to ensure that the period or question mark is not preceded by an uppercase letter followed by a lowercase letter and a period.
\s - Matches any whitespace character.
The resulting list of sentences is assigned to the sentences variable.
The count_words() method is invoked for each sentence in the sentences list.
Inside the count_words() method, the re.sub() function is used to remove all non-alphabetic characters from the sentence. The regular expression r'[^a-zA-Z\s]' is used to match any character that is not an uppercase or lowercase letter or a whitespace character.
The resulting string is assigned to the sentence variable.
The split() method is invoked on the sentence variable to split it into a list of words.
The length of the resulting list of words is assigned to the words variable.
The count_words() method returns the length of the words list.
The process_text_file() method returns the maximum count of words found in any sentence.

        sentences = re.split(r'(?<!\w\.\w.)(?<![A-Z][a-z]\.)(?<=\.|\?)\s', sentences_string)

        words = sentence.split()
        return len(words)

        max_count = 0
        for sentence in sentences:
            count = self.count_words(sentence)
            if count > max_count:
                max_count = count

        return max_count
class Test(unittest.TestCase):
    def test(self):

            cnt = ss.process_text_file("Mr. Smith is a teacher. Yes 1 2 3 4 5 6.")
            return cnt

<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
