Inside the test() method, the z_score() method is invoked with the argument [1].
Inside the z_score() method, the mean() method is invoked with the argument [1].
Inside the mean() method, the len() function is invoked with the argument [1].
The len() function returns the length of the list, which is 1.
The mean() method returns the sum of the list divided by the length, which is 1 / 1 = 1.
The standard_deviation() method is invoked with the argument [1].
Inside the standard_deviation() method, the len() function is invoked with the argument [1].
The len() function returns the length of the list, which is 1.
The standard_deviation() method returns None if the length is less than 2, which is not the case here.
The mean() method is invoked again with the argument [1].
Inside the mean() method, the sum() function is invoked with the argument [1].
The sum() function returns the sum of the list, which is 1.
The mean() method returns the sum of the list divided by the length, which is 1 / 1 = 1.
The standard_deviation() method is invoked again with the argument [1].
Inside the standard_deviation() method, the mean() method is invoked with the argument [1].
Inside the mean() method, the sum() function is invoked with the argument [1].
The sum() function returns the sum of the list, which is 1.
The mean() method returns the sum of the list divided by the length, which is 1 / 1 = 1.
The standard_deviation() method returns the square root of the sum of the squared differences between each element and the mean divided by the length minus 1, which is sqrt((1 - 1) ** 2 / (1 - 1)) = sqrt(0 / 0) = sqrt(0) = 0.
The z_score() method returns a list of z-scores, which is [(1 - 1) / 0] = [0 / 0] = [None].
