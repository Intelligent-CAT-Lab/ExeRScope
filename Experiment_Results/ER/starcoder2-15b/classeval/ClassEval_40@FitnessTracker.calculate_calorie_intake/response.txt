Inside the test() method, a FitnessTracker object is created with the following parameters:
height = 1.72
weight = 53
age = 22
sex = "male"
This object is assigned to the variable fitnessTracker.
The calculate_calorie_intake() method is then called on the fitnessTracker object.
Inside the calculate_calorie_intake() method, the condition_judge() method is called.
Inside the condition_judge() method, the get_BMI() method is called.
Inside the get_BMI() method, the weight and height attributes of the FitnessTracker object are used to calculate the BMI.
The BMI is then compared to the BMI range for males and females stored in the BMI_std attribute.
Depending on the BMI, the condition_judge() method returns 1 (too fat), -1 (too thin), or 0 (normal).
The calculate_calorie_intake() method then uses the condition_judge() result to determine the calorie intake.
If the condition_judge() result is 1 (too fat), the calorie intake is set to BMR * 1.2 (Sedentary lifestyle).
If the condition_judge() result is -1 (too thin), the calorie intake is set to BMR * 1.6 (Active lifestyle).
If the condition_judge() result is 0 (normal), the calorie intake is set to BMR * 1.4 (Moderate lifestyle).
The calculate_calorie_intake() method then returns the calorie intake.

<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
