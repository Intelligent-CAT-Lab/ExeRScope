Inside the test() method, the correlation() method is invoked with the arguments [1, 1, 1] and [2, 2, 2].
Inside the correlation() method, the n variable is set to the length of the x argument, which is 3.
The mean_x variable is set to the mean of the x argument, which is 1.
The mean_y variable is set to the mean of the y argument, which is 2.
The numerator variable is set to the sum of the product of (xi - mean_x) and (yi - mean_y) for each xi, yi in the zip of x and y.
The denominator variable is set to the square root of the product of the sum of (xi - mean_x) squared for each xi in x and the sum of (yi - mean_y) squared for each yi in y.
Since the denominator is not equal to 0, the correlation is returned as numerator / denominator, which is 0.

<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method, the correlation_matrix() method is invoked with the argument [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]].
Inside the correlation_matrix() method, the matrix variable is initialized to an empty list.
A for loop iterates over the range of the length of the first row of the data argument, which is 3.
Inside the for loop, a row variable is initialized to an empty list.
