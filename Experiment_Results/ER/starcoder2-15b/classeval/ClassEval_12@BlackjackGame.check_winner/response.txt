Inside the test() method, the BlackjackGame class is instantiated and assigned to the self.blackjackGame variable.
The create_deck() method is called on the self.blackjackGame object, which returns a shuffled deck of cards.
The player_hand and dealer_hand variables are assigned lists of cards.
The check_winner() method is called on the self.blackjackGame object, passing in the player_hand and dealer_hand as arguments.
Inside the check_winner() method, the calculate_hand_value() method is called twice, once for each hand.
Inside the calculate_hand_value() method, the value and num_aces variables are initialized to 0.
A for loop iterates over each card in the hand, extracting the rank from the card.
If the rank is a digit, it is converted to an integer and added to the value.
If the rank is 'J', 'Q', or 'K', 10 is added to the value.
If the rank is 'A', 11 is added to the value and num_aces is incremented by 1.
A while loop checks if the value is greater than 21 and num_aces is greater than 0.
If both conditions are true, 10 is subtracted from the value and num_aces is decremented by 1.
After the loop, the value is returned.
The check_winner() method calls the calculate_hand_value() method twice, passing in the player_hand and dealer_hand as arguments.
The values returned by the calculate_hand_value() method are assigned to the player_value and dealer_value variables, respectively.
If both player_value and dealer_value are greater than 21, the player with the lower value wins.
If only player_value is greater than 21, the dealer wins.
If only dealer_value is greater than 21, the player wins.
If neither player_value nor dealer_value are greater than 21, the player with the higher value wins.
The method returns a string indicating the winner.

Dealer wins
