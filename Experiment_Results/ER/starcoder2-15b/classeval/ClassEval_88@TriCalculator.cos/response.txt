Inside the test() method, the TriCalculator() class is instantiated and assigned to the tricalculator variable.
The cos() method is called on the tricalculator object, passing in the argument 0.
Inside the cos() method, the taylor() method is called, passing in the arguments x (which is 0) and n (which is 50).
Inside the taylor() method, the factorial() method is called, passing in the argument a (which is 1).
Inside the factorial() method, the variable b is initialized to 1.
A while loop is entered, which iterates while a is not equal to 1.
Inside the loop, b is multiplied by a, and a is decremented by 1.
After the loop completes, b is returned, which is 1.
The taylor() method returns the result of calling the factorial() method, which is 1.
The cos() method returns the result of calling the taylor() method, which is 1.
The test() method returns the result of calling the cos() method, which is 1.

        self.a = a
        self.b = b

    def add(self):

<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method, the Calculator class is instantiated and assigned to the calculator variable.
The Calculator class takes two arguments, a and b, and assigns them to the self.a and self.b attributes, respectively.
The add() method is called on the calculator object.
Inside the add() method, the self.a and self.b attributes are added together and returned.
The test() method returns the result of calling the add() method, which is 15.
<<<Output>>>
