Inside the test() method, the DataStatistics4.skewness([1, 1, 1]) method is invoked. The purpose of this method is to calculate the skewness of a given dataset. In this case, the dataset is [1, 1, 1].
Inside the skewness() method, the variable n is assigned the length of the dataset, which is 3.
The variable mean is assigned the mean of the dataset, which is 1.
The variable variance is assigned the variance of the dataset, which is 0.
The variable std_deviation is assigned the standard deviation of the dataset, which is 0.
The variable skewness is assigned the skewness of the dataset, which is 0.
The method returns the skewness value, which is 0.

<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
