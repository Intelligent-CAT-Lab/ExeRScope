Inside the test() method, the ComplexCalculator class is instantiated and assigned to the complexCalculator variable.
The subtract() method is called on the complexCalculator object, passing in two complex numbers as arguments.
The subtract() method performs subtraction on the real and imaginary parts of the two complex numbers, and returns a new complex number with the result.

What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
