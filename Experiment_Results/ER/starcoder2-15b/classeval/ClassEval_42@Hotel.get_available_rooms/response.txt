Inside the test() method, a Hotel object is created with the name 'Test Hotel' and the available rooms dictionary {'single': 3, 'double': 2, 'triple': 2}.
The book_room() method is called with the arguments 'single', 3, and 'guest 1'.
Inside the book_room() method, the room_type 'single' is checked to see if it is in the available_rooms dictionary. It is, so the if statement is skipped.
The room_number 3 is then checked to see if it is less than or equal to the number of available rooms for the 'single' room type. It is, so the if statement is skipped.
The room_type 'single' is then checked to see if it is in the booked_rooms dictionary. It is not, so the if statement is executed.
The booked_rooms dictionary is updated to include the 'single' room type and an empty dictionary as the value.
The booked_rooms dictionary is then updated to include the name 'guest 1' and the room_number 3 as a key-value pair.
The available_rooms dictionary is updated to decrease the number of available 'single' rooms by 3.
The string 'Success!' is returned.
The get_available_rooms() method is called with the argument 'single'.
Inside the get_available_rooms() method, the number of available 'single' rooms is returned from the available_rooms dictionary.
