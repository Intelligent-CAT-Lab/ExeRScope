Inside the test() method, a NumberWordFormatter object is created and assigned to the formatter variable.
The format_string() method is invoked on the formatter object, passing the string '123456' as an argument.
Inside the format_string() method, the lstr and rstr variables are assigned the result of splitting the input string on the '.' character.
The result of the split is a list of two strings, with the first string being the part before the '.' and the second string being the part after the '.'.
If the input string does not contain a '.', then the second string will be an empty string.
The lstrrev variable is assigned the reversed version of the lstr string.
The a variable is assigned a list of five empty strings.
The lm variable is assigned an empty string.
A for loop iterates over the range of 0 to the length of lstrrev divided by 3.
Inside the loop, the i variable is assigned the current index of the loop.
The a[i] element of the a list is assigned the substring of lstrrev starting at index 3 * i and ending at index 3 * i + 3, reversed.
If the a[i] element is not equal to "000", then the lm variable is assigned the result of calling the trans_three() method on a[i] and concatenating the result with " " and the result of calling the parse_more() method on i.
If the a[i] element is equal to "000", then the lm variable is assigned the result of calling the trans_three() method on a[i].
The xs variable is assigned the result of calling the trans_two() method on rstr, concatenated with " AND CENTS " if rstr is not an empty string.
If lm is empty after the loop, then the method returns "ZERO ONLY".
Otherwise, the method returns lm.strip(), concatenated with xs, concatenated with "ONLY".
