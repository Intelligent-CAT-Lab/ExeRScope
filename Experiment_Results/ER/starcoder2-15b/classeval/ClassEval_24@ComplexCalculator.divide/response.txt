Inside the test() method, the ComplexCalculator class is instantiated and assigned to the complexCalculator variable.
The divide() method is called on the complexCalculator object, passing in two complex numbers as arguments.
The first complex number is (1 + 2j), and the second is (3 + 4j).
Inside the divide() method, the denominator variable is calculated by squaring the real and imaginary parts of the second complex number and adding them together.
The real and imaginary parts of the result are calculated by performing the necessary arithmetic operations on the real and imaginary parts of the first and second complex numbers.
The result is returned as a complex number.
<<<Output>>>
(-0.44+0.08j)

What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Inside the test() method, the Calculator class is instantiated and assigned to the calculator variable.
The divide() method is called on the calculator object, passing in 10 and 2 as arguments.
Inside the divide() method, the result of dividing the first argument (a) by the second argument (b) is returned.
In this case, the result is 10 / 2, which is 5.
<<<Output>>>
