Inside the test() method, the interpolate_1d() method is invoked with the following arguments:
x = [1, 6, 4]
y = [1, 7, 5]
x_interp = [2, 3]
The purpose of this method is to perform 1-dimensional interpolation on a set of data points (x, y) to obtain interpolated values at a set of new points (x_interp).
Inside the interpolate_1d() method, the variable y_interp is initialized to an empty list.
A for loop iterates over each element xi in x_interp.
Inside the for loop, another for loop iterates over the range of indices from 0 to len(x) - 2.
Inside the inner for loop, if the condition x[i] <= xi <= x[i+1] is satisfied, the following code is executed:
yi = y[i] + (y[i+1] - y[i]) * (xi - x[i]) / (x[i+1] - x[i])
y_interp.append(yi)
break
The first iteration of the outer for loop:
xi = 2
i = 0
x[i] = 1
x[i+1] = 6
y[i] = 1
y[i+1] = 7
The condition x[i] <= xi <= x[i+1] is satisfied, so the following code is executed:
yi = y[i] + (y[i+1] - y[i]) * (xi - x[i]) / (x[i+1] - x[i])
yi = 1 + (7 - 1) * (2 - 1) / (6 - 1)
yi = 1 + 6 * 1 / 5
yi = 1 + 1.2
yi = 2.2
y_interp.append(yi)
break
The second iteration of the outer for loop:
xi = 3
i = 0
x[i] = 1
x[i+1] = 6
y[i] = 1
y[i+1] = 7
The condition x[i] <= xi <= x[i+1] is satisfied, so the following code is executed:
yi = y[i] + (y[i+1] - y[i]) * (xi - x[i]) / (x[i+1] - x[i])
yi = 1 + (7 - 1) * (3 - 1) / (6 - 1)
yi = 1 + 6 * 2 / 5
yi = 1 + 2.4
yi = 3.4
y_interp.append(yi)
break
After the inner for loop completes, the outer for loop continues to the next element in x_interp.
The third iteration of the outer for loop:
xi = 4
i = 0
x[i] = 1
x[i+1] = 6
y[i] = 1
y[i+1] = 7
The condition x[i] <= xi <= x[i+1] is not satisfied, so the inner for loop continues to the next value of i.
i = 1
x[i] = 6
x[i+1] = 4
y[i] = 7
y[i+1] = 5
The condition x[i] <= xi <= x[i+1] is satisfied, so the following code is executed:
yi = y[i] + (y[i+1] - y[i]) * (xi - x[i]) / (x[i+1] - x[i])
yi = 7 + (5 - 7) * (4 - 6) / (4 - 6)
yi = 7 + (-2) * (-2) / 0
yi = 7 + 4 / 0
yi = 7 + inf
yi = inf
y_interp.append(yi)
break
After the inner for loop completes, the outer for loop continues to the next element in x_interp.
Since there are no more elements in x_interp, the for loop completes.
The method returns y_interp, which is [2.2, 3.4, inf].
<<<Output>>>
[2.2, 3.4, inf]
