Inside the test() method, the ZipFileProcessor class is instantiated with the zip file name 'example.zip'.
The create_zip_file() method is called with the files_to_zip list and the new_zip_file name as arguments.
Inside the create_zip_file() method, a ZipFile object is created with the new_zip_file name and 'w' mode.
A for loop iterates over the files_to_zip list, and for each file, the write() method of the ZipFile object is called with the file name and the base name of the file.
The try-except block handles any exceptions that may occur during the creation of the ZipFile object or during the write() method call.
If an exception is raised, the method returns False.
If no exception is raised, the method returns True.

<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method, the FileProcessor class is instantiated with the example_file_path as the file_path argument.
The copy_file() method is called with the new_file_path as the destination argument.
Inside the copy_file() method, the shutil.copy() function is called with the file_path and destination arguments.
The try-except block handles any exceptions that may occur during the copy operation.
If an exception is raised, the method returns False.
If no exception is raised, the method returns True.
