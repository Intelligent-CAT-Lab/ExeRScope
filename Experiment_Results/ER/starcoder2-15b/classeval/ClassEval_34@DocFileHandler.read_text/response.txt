Inside the test() method, the DocFileHandler class is instantiated with the file_path "test_example.docx".
The read_text() method is called on the handler instance.
Inside the read_text() method, a Document object is created from the file_path using the Document() constructor.
A list called text is initialized to an empty list.
A for loop iterates over the paragraphs in the Document object.
Inside the loop, the text attribute of each paragraph is appended to the text list.
After the loop completes, the text list is joined using "\n" as the separator, and the resulting string is returned.
The expected_content variable is set to "aaa\nbbb".
The if statement checks if the file_path exists. If it does, the file is deleted using os.remove().
The return statement returns the text_content and expected_content variables.
<<<Output>>>
('aaa\nbbb', 'aaa\nbbb')

<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method, the ZipFileHandler class is instantiated with the file_path "test_example.zip".
The compress_dir() method is called on the handler instance, passing in the dir_path "test_dir" and the file_path "test_example.zip".
Inside the compress_dir() method, a with statement is used to open a ZipFile object with the file_path as the filename and 'w' as the mode.
A for loop is used to iterate over the contents of the directory specified by dir_path using os.walk().
Inside the loop, the file_path is constructed using os.path.join() and the root and file variables.
The file_path is then added to the ZipFile object using the write() method.
After the loop completes, the with statement closes the ZipFile object and the method returns True.
The if statement checks if the file_path exists. If it does, the file is deleted using os.remove().
The if statement checks if the dir_path exists. If it does, the directory is deleted using shutil.rmtree().
