Inside the test() method, the DocFileHandler class is instantiated with the file_path "test_example.docx".
The read_text() method is called on the handler instance, which reads the text content of the file and returns it as a string.
The write_text() method is called on the handler instance, with the content "New content 1". This method writes the content to the file.
The add_heading() method is called on the handler instance, with the heading "Test Heading 1". This method adds the heading to the file.
The add_table() method is called on the handler instance, with the data [['Name', 'Age']]. This method adds a table to the file.
The file is then deleted if it exists.

<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method, the ZipFileHandler class is instantiated with the file_path "test_example.zip".
The create_zip() method is called on the handler instance, with the files ["file1.txt", "file2.txt"]. This method creates a zip file with the specified files.
The extract_zip() method is called on the handler instance, with the extract_path "extracted_files". This method extracts the contents of the zip file to the specified directory.
The add_file() method is called on the handler instance, with the file "file3.txt". This method adds the specified file to the zip file.
The remove_file() method is called on the handler instance, with the file "file3.txt". This method removes the specified file from the zip file.
The file "test_example.zip" is deleted if it exists.
The directory "extracted_files" is deleted if it exists.
