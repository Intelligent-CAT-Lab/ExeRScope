Inside the test() method, the MovieBookingSystem class is instantiated and assigned to the self.system variable.
The add_movie() method is called on the self.system object, passing in the following arguments:
'Batman' as the name of the movie
29.9 as the price of the movie
'17:05' as the start time of the movie
'19:25' as the end time of the movie
3 as the number of rows and columns of the seats in the movie
Inside the add_movie() method, a new movie dictionary is created with the following keys and values:
'name': name, which is 'Batman'
'price': price, which is 29.9
'start_time': datetime.strptime(start_time, '%H:%M'), which is datetime.strptime('17:05', '%H:%M')
'end_time': datetime.strptime(end_time, '%H:%M'), which is datetime.strptime('19:25', '%H:%M')
'seats': np.zeros((n, n)), which is np.zeros((3, 3))
The movie dictionary is appended to the self.movies list.
After the add_movie() method is called, the return statement returns the length of the self.movies list and the name of the first movie in the list.

<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method, a LinkedList object is instantiated and assigned to the self.llist variable.
The insert() method is called on the self.llist object, passing in the following arguments:
1
2
3
4
5
Inside the insert() method, a new Node object is created with the data argument as the data value.
If the self.head attribute of the LinkedList object is None, the self.head attribute is set to the new Node object.
Otherwise, a while loop is entered, where the current attribute of the LinkedList object is set to the self.head attribute.
Inside the while loop, if the next attribute of the current Node object is not None, the current attribute is set to the next attribute of the current Node object.
If the next attribute of the current Node object is None, the next attribute of the current Node object is set to the new Node object.
After the while loop, the print_list() method is called on the self.llist object.
Inside the print_list() method, a while loop is entered, where the current attribute
