Inside the test() method, the Calculator() class is instantiated and assigned to the calculator variable.
The calculate() method is not invoked.
Inside the Calculator class, the __init__() method is defined.
Inside the __init__() method, a dictionary is created and assigned to the self.operators attribute.
The dictionary contains keys representing mathematical operators and values representing lambda functions that perform the corresponding mathematical operation.
The calculate() method takes an expression as an argument and returns the result of the calculation.
Inside the calculate() method, several variables are initialized:
operand_stack: an empty list to store operands.
operator_stack: an empty list to store operators.
num_buffer: an empty string to store the current number being processed.
The for loop iterates over each character in the expression.
If the character is a digit or a decimal point (.), the character is appended to the num_buffer.
If the character is an operator (+, -, *, /, or ^), the num_buffer is converted to a float and appended to the operand_stack.
The num_buffer is then reset to an empty string.
The operator is then pushed onto the operator_stack.
If the character is an opening parenthesis (,), the operator is pushed onto the operator_stack.
If the character is a closing parenthesis ()), the operator_stack is popped until the opening parenthesis is found.
The corresponding operator and operands are popped from the operand_stack and the result is calculated.
The result is then pushed back onto the operand_stack.
If the num_buffer is not empty, the num_buffer is converted to a float and appended to the operand_stack.
While the operator_stack is not empty, the corresponding operator and operands are popped from the operand_stack and the result is calculated.
The result is then pushed back onto the operand_stack.
The last operand in the operand_stack is returned as the result of the calculation.
The precedence() method takes an operator as an argument and returns the precedence of the operator.
The precedence() method is used to determine the order of operations in the calculate() method.
The apply_operator() method takes two arguments: operand_stack and operator_stack.
It pops the last operator from the operator_stack and applies it to the last two operands in the operand_stack.
The result is then pushed back onto the operand_stack.
The return value of the calculate() method is the last operand in the operand_stack.
