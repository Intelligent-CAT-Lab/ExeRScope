Inside the test() method, the Order class is instantiated and assigned to the self.order variable.
The menu attribute of the self.order object is initialized to an empty list.
The menu attribute is a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a dish in the menu.
The sales attribute of the self.order object is initialized to a dictionary.
The sales attribute is a dictionary that maps dish names to their corresponding sales.
The add_dish() method is called on the self.order object with a dish dictionary as an argument.
The dish dictionary has the following keys: "dish", "price", and "count".
The calculate_total() method is called on the self.order object.
The calculate_total() method calculates the total price of the selected dishes based on the dish prices, dish counts, and dish sales.
The checkout() method is called on the self.order object.
The checkout() method checks if there are any selected dishes. If there are no selected dishes, it returns False.
If there are selected dishes, it calls the calculate_total() method to calculate the total price of the selected dishes.
The selected_dishes attribute of the self.order object is set to an empty list.
The checkout() method returns the total price of the selected dishes.

What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
