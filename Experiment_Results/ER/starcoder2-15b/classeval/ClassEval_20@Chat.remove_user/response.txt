Inside the test() method, the Chat class is instantiated and assigned to the chat variable.
The remove_user() method is called on the chat object with the argument 'John'.
Inside the remove_user() method, the username is checked to see if it is in the users dictionary.
Since 'John' is not in the users dictionary, the method returns False.
The get_messages() method is called on the chat object with the argument 'John'.
Inside the get_messages() method, the username is checked to see if it is in the users dictionary.
Since 'John' is not in the users dictionary, an empty list is returned.
<<<Output>>>
(False, {})

<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Inside the test() method, the Calculator class is instantiated with the arguments 10 and 5, and assigned to the calculator variable.
The add() method is called on the calculator object, which returns the sum of the a and b attributes, which are 10 and 5, respectively.
The subtract() method is called on the calculator object, which returns the difference of the a and b attributes, which are 10 and 5, respectively.
The multiply() method is called on the calculator object, which returns the product of the a and b attributes, which are 10 and 5, respectively.
The divide() method is called on the calculator object, which returns the quotient of the a and b attributes, which are 10 and 5, respectively.
