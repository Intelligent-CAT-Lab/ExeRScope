Inside the test() method, the Order class is instantiated and assigned to the self.order variable.
The menu attribute of the self.order object is initialized to an empty list.
The sales attribute of the self.order object is initialized to an empty dictionary.
The add_dish() method is called twice with two different dish dictionaries as arguments.
The first call to add_dish() adds a dish with the name "dish1" and a count of 2 to the selected_dishes attribute of the self.order object.
The second call to add_dish() adds a dish with the name "dish3" and a count of 2 to the selected_dishes attribute of the self.order object.
The calculate_total() method is called, which calculates the total price of the selected dishes based on the price, count, and sales of each dish.
The total price is calculated by multiplying the price of each dish by its count and the sales of that dish.
The total price is then returned.

What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
