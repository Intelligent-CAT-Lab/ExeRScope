Inside the test() method, the TriCalculator() class is instantiated and assigned to the tricalculator variable.
The taylor() method is invoked on the tricalculator object, passing 90 and 50 as arguments.
Inside the taylor() method, the x variable is set to 90 / 180 * pi, which is approximately 0.5235987755982989.
The a variable is initialized to 1.
The count variable is initialized to 1.
A for loop iterates from 1 to n - 1 (which is 49 in this case).
Inside the loop, the if statement checks if count is odd.
If it is, a is subtracted by (x ** (2 * k)) / self.factorial(2 * k), where k is the current iteration of the loop.
Otherwise, a is added by (x ** (2 * k)) / self.factorial(2 * k).
count is incremented by 1.
After the loop completes, a is returned, which is approximately 0.5235987755982989.
<<<Output>>>
0.5235987755982989

<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method, the Calculator class is instantiated with the arguments 10 and 5, and assigned to the calculator variable.
The add() method is invoked on the calculator object.
Inside the add() method, the a and b attributes of the calculator object are added and returned, which is 15.
<<<Output>>>
15
