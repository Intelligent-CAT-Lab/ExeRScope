Inside the test() method, the trans_two() method is invoked with the argument '80'.
Inside the trans_two() method, the s variable is initialized to '80'.
The s variable is padded with leading zeros to ensure it has a length of 2.
The first if statement checks if the first character of s is '0'.
Since the first character of s is '8', the if statement is not executed.
The second if statement checks if the first character of s is '1'.
Since the first character of s is not '1', the if statement is not executed.
The third if statement checks if the second character of s is '0'.
Since the second character of s is not '0', the if statement is not executed.
The last else statement is executed, which calls the trans_two() method again with the argument '80'.
The trans_two() method is recursively called, and the s variable is initialized to '80'.
The s variable is padded with leading zeros to ensure it has a length of 2.
The first if statement checks if the first character of s is '0'.
Since the first character of s is '8', the if statement is not executed.
The second if statement checks if the first character of s is '1'.
Since the first character of s is not '1', the if statement is not executed.
The third if statement checks if the second character of s is '0'.
Since the second character of s is not '0', the if statement is not executed.
The last else statement is executed, which calls the trans_two() method again with the argument '80'.
