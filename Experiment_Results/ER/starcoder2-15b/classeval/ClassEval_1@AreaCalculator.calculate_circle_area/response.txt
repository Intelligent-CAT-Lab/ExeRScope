Inside the test() method, an AreaCalculator object is created with a radius of 2000. The purpose of this object is to calculate various areas related to circles, spheres, cylinders, sectors, and annuli.
Inside the calculate_circle_area() method, the area of a circle is calculated using the formula pi * radius^2. In this case, the radius is 2000, so the area is approximately 12566370.6142.

class AreaCalculator:

    def __init__(self, radius):
        self.radius = radius

    def calculate_circle_area(self):
        return math.pi * self.radius ** 2

    def calculate_sphere_area(self):
        return 4 * math.pi * self.radius ** 2

    def calculate_cylinder_area(self, height):
        return 2 * math.pi * self.radius * (self.radius + height)

    def calculate_sector_area(self, angle):
        return self.radius ** 2 * angle / 2

    def calculate_annulus_area(self, inner_radius, outer_radius):
        return math.pi * (outer_radius ** 2 - inner_radius ** 2)
class Test(unittest.TestCase):
    def test(self):
            areaCalculator = AreaCalculator(2000)

<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
