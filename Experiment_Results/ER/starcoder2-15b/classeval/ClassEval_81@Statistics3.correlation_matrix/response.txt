Inside the test() method, the correlation_matrix() method is invoked with the argument [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12], [13, 14, 15]].
Inside the correlation_matrix() method, the matrix variable is initialized to an empty list.
A for loop iterates over the range of the length of the first element of the data argument (which is 3 in this case).
Inside the for loop, a row variable is initialized to an empty list.
Another for loop iterates over the range of the length of the first element of the data argument (which is 3 in this case).
Inside the nested for loop, a column1 variable is initialized to a list comprehension that creates a list of the i-th element of each row in the data argument.
A column2 variable is initialized to a list comprehension that creates a list of the j-th element of each row in the data argument.
A correlation variable is initialized to the correlation() method, which calculates the correlation between the column1 and column2 lists.
The correlation() method is invoked with the arguments column1 and column2.
Inside the correlation() method, the n variable is initialized to the length of the x argument (which is the column1 list).
The mean_x variable is initialized to the mean() method, which calculates the mean of the x argument (which is the column1 list).
The mean_y variable is initialized to the mean() method, which calculates the mean of the y argument (which is the column2 list).
The numerator variable is initialized to the sum of the product of (xi - mean_x) and (yi - mean_y) for each xi, yi in the zip() of the x and y arguments (which are the column1 and column2 lists, respectively).
The denominator variable is initialized to the square root of the product of the sum of (xi - mean_x) ** 2 for each xi in the x argument (which is the column1 list) and the sum of (yi - mean_y) ** 2 for each yi in the y argument (which is the column2 list).
If the denominator is 0, the method returns None.
Otherwise, the method returns the numerator divided by the denominator.
The correlation variable is appended to the row list.
The row list is appended to the matrix list.
After the nested for loops complete, the method returns the matrix list.

[[1.0, 1.0, 1.0], [1.0, 1.0, 1.0], [1.0, 1.0, 1.0]]
