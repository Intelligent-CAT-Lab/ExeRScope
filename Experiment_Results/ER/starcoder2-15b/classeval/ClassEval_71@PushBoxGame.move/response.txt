Inside the test() method, the PushBoxGame class is instantiated with a map. The map is a list of strings, each representing a row of the game map.
The PushBoxGame class has several methods, including init_game(), check_win(), and move().
Inside the init_game() method, the player's position, targets, and boxes are initialized based on the map.
Inside the check_win() method, the number of boxes on targets is counted. If all boxes are on targets, the game is over.
Inside the move() method, the player's position is updated based on the given direction. If the new position is a box, the box is moved as well.
After the move() method is called, the check_win() method is called to check if the game is over.
