Inside the test() method, the factorial() method is invoked with the argument 2.
Inside the factorial() method, the variable b is initialized to 1.
The while loop starts with a = 2 and continues until a is equal to 1.
Inside the loop, b is multiplied by a and a is decremented by 1.
At the start: a = 2, b = 1
The first iteration: a = 1, b = 1 * 2 = 2
After the loop completes, the method returns b, which is 2.

<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method, the taylor() method is invoked with the arguments 10 and 50.
Inside the taylor() method, the variable a is initialized to 1.
The variable x is set to 10 / 180 * pi, which is approximately 0.17453292519943295.
The variable count is initialized to 1.
The for loop starts with k = 1 and continues until k is equal to 50.
Inside the loop, if count is odd, a is subtracted by (x ** (2 * k)) / factorial(2 * k). Otherwise, a is added by (x ** (2 * k)) / factorial(2 * k).
At the start: a = 1, count = 1
The first iteration: k = 1, a = 1 - (0.17453292519943295 ** (2 * 1)) / factorial(2 * 1) = 0.825467074800567
The second iteration: k = 2, a = 0.825467074800567 + (0.17453292519943295 ** (2 * 2)) / factorial(2 * 2) = 0.9999999999999999
After the loop completes, the method returns a, which is 0.9999999999999999.
