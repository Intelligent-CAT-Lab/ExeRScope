Inside the test() method, a ShoppingCart object is created and assigned to the shoppingcart variable.
The add_item() method is called on the shoppingcart object, passing in the string "bbb" as the item parameter, 1 as the price parameter, and 1 as the quantity parameter.
The add_item() method checks if the item parameter is already in the items dictionary. Since it is not, a new key-value pair is added to the items dictionary, with the item parameter as the key and a dictionary with the price and quantity parameters as the value.
The return statement returns the items dictionary.
<<<Output>>>
{'bbb': {'price': 1, 'quantity': 1}}

Consider the following code:

import unittest
class ShoppingCart:
    def __init__(self):
        self.items = {}

    def add_item(self, item, price, quantity=1):
        if item in self.items:
            self.items[item] = {'price': price, 'quantity': quantity}
        else:
            self.items[item] = {'price': price, 'quantity': quantity}

    def remove_item(self, item, quantity=1):
        if item in self.items:
            self.items[item]['quantity'] -= quantity
        else:
            pass

    def view_items(self) -> dict:
        return self.items

    def total_price(self) -> float:
        return sum([item['quantity'] * item['price'] for item in self.items.values()])
class Test(unittest.TestCase):
    def test(self):
            shoppingcart = ShoppingCart()
            shoppingcart.add_item("bbb", 1)
            return shoppingcart.total_price()
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The total_price() method is called on the shoppingcart object.
The total_price() method returns the sum of the quantity multiplied by the price for each item in the items dictionary. Since there is only one item in the items dictionary, the total price is 1.
The return statement returns the total price.
