Inside the test() method, a VendingMachine object is created and assigned to the variable vendingMachine.
The inventory attribute of the vendingMachine object is set to a dictionary with two items: 'Coke' and 'Pizza'.
The display_items() method is called on the vendingMachine object.
Inside the display_items() method, the if statement checks if the inventory attribute is empty. Since it is not empty, the else block is executed.
A list is created to store the items.
A for loop iterates over the items in the inventory attribute. For each item, the item_name and item_info are extracted.
The item_name and item_info are formatted as a string and appended to the items list.
The items list is joined together using the "\n" separator and returned.
<<<Output>>>
Coke - $1.25 [0]
Pizza - $1.25 [10]

<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method, a VendingMachine object is created and assigned to the variable vendingMachine.
The add_item() method is called on the vendingMachine object with the arguments 'Coke', 1.25, and 10.
The add_item() method checks if the item_name already exists in the inventory attribute. Since it does not, a new item is added to the inventory attribute with the given item_name, price, and quantity.
The add_item() method is called again with the arguments 'Pizza', 1.25, and 10.
The add_item() method checks if the item_name already exists in the inventory attribute. Since it does not, a new item is added to the inventory attribute with the given item_name, price, and quantity.
The insert_coin() method is called on the vendingMachine object with the argument 1.25.
The insert_coin() method adds the amount to the balance attribute and returns the updated balance.
The purchase_item() method is called on the vendingMachine object with the argument 'Coke'.
The purchase_item() method checks if the item_name exists in the inventory attribute. Since it does, the item is retrieved from the inventory attribute.
The item's quantity is checked to see if it is greater than 0 and the balance is greater than or equal to the item's price. Since both conditions are met, the balance is reduced by the item's price, the item's quantity is reduced by 1, and the
