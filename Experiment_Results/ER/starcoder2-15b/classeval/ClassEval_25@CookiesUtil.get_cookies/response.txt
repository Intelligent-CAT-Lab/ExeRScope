Inside the test() method, the CookiesUtil class is instantiated with the cookies_file parameter set to 'cookies.json'.
The response variable is initialized to a dictionary with four keys: 'cookies', 'cookies2', 'cookies3', and 'cookies4'. Each key has a value that is a dictionary with two keys: 'key1', 'key2', 'key3', 'key4', 'key5', 'key6', 'key7', and 'key8'.
The get_cookies() method is called on the cookies_util object, passing in the response dictionary as an argument.
Inside the get_cookies() method, the cookies attribute of the cookies_util object is set to the value of the 'cookies' key in the response dictionary.
The _save_cookies() method is called on the cookies_util object.
Inside the _save_cookies() method, a try-except block is used to open the cookies_file file in write mode. If the file is successfully opened, the cookies attribute of the cookies_util object is written to the file using json.dump(). If an exception is raised, the method returns False.
After the _save_cookies() method completes, the cookies attribute of the cookies_util object is returned.
<<<Output>>>
{'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2'}

<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method, the Calculator class is instantiated with the a and b parameters set to 10 and 5, respectively.
The divide() method is called on the calculator object.
Inside the divide() method, the a and b attributes of the calculator object are divided and the result is returned.
