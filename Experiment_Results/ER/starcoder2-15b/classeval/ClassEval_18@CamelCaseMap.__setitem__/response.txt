Inside the test() method, a CamelCaseMap object is created and assigned to the camelize_map variable.
The __setitem__() method is called on the camelize_map object with the key 'first_name' and the value 'John'.
The __setitem__() method is called again on the camelize_map object with the key 'first_Name' and the value 'newname'.
The __getitem__() method is called on the camelize_map object with the key 'first_name'.
The __getitem__() method calls the _convert_key() method with the key 'first_name'.
The _convert_key() method splits the key into parts using the underscore character as the delimiter.
The _convert_key() method returns the first part of the key ('first') concatenated with the camel-cased version of the remaining parts ('Name').
The __getitem__() method returns the value associated with the converted key ('first_Name') from the _data dictionary.
Since the key 'first_Name' was set to 'newname' in the previous step, the value 'newname' is returned.

<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```Test.test()```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
Inside the test() method, a LinkedList object is created and assigned to the linked_list variable.
The add() method is called on the linked_list object with the value 1.
The add() method creates a Node object with the value 1 and sets it as the head of the linked list.
The add() method is called again with the value 2.
The add() method creates a Node object with the value 2 and sets it as the next node of the head node.
The add() method is called again with the value 3.
The add() method creates a Node object with the value 3 and sets it as the next node of the second node.
The remove() method is called on the linked_list object with the value 2.
The remove() method checks if the head node is None. Since it is not, it checks if the head node's value is equal to 2. Since it is not, it enters the while loop.
The while loop checks if the next node of the head node is not None. Since it is not, it checks if the value of the next node is equal to 2. Since it is, it sets the next node of the head node to the next node of the next node.
The __iter__() method is called on the linked_list object.
The __iter__() method creates a generator that yields the value of each node in the linked list.
Since the head node's value is 1, the generator yields 1.
The next node's value is 3, so the generator yields 3.
The next node is None, so the generator stops.
The list() function is called on the generator, which returns a list of the yielded values.
