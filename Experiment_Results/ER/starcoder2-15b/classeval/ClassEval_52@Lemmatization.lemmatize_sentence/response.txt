Inside the test() method, a Lemmatization object is created and assigned to the lemmatization variable.
The lemmatize_sentence() method is called on the lemmatization object, passing in the sentence "Until the beating, Cantanco's eyesight had been weak, but adequate."
Inside the lemmatize_sentence() method, the remove_punctuation() method is called on the sentence, which removes all punctuation from the sentence.
The sentence is then tokenized using the word_tokenize() function from the nltk library.
The pos_tag() function from the nltk library is used to tag each word in the sentence with its part of speech.
A for loop iterates over the tagged words, and for each word, the appropriate lemmatizer method is called based on the part of speech tag.
The lemmatized word is appended to the lemmatized_words list.
After the loop completes, the lemmatized_words list is returned.
