The function f takes a list orig as input and returns a list copy.
The function first creates a copy of the input list orig and assigns it to the variable copy.
Then, the function appends the integer 100 to the end of the copy list copy.
Next, the function removes the last element from the original list orig.
Finally, the function returns the copy list copy.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 2, 3], we need to analyze the steps of the function.
The function creates a copy of the input list [1, 2, 3] and assigns it to the variable copy.
Then, the function appends the integer 100 to the end of the copy list [1, 2, 3, 100].
Next, the function removes the last element from the original list [1, 2, 3].
Finally, the function returns the copy list [1, 2, 3, 100].
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 2, 3] is [1, 2, 3, 100].
<<<Output>>>
[1, 2, 3, 100]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(x):
    return x + 1

<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f(1)```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The function f takes an integer x as input and returns the integer x + 1.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 1, we need to analyze the steps of the function.
The function takes the input 1 and adds 1 to it, resulting in the output 2.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 1 is 2.
