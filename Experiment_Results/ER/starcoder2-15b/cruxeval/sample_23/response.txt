The function f takes two arguments: text and chars.
The function first checks if chars is not empty.
If chars is not empty, the function removes all characters in chars from the end of text using the rstrip method.
If chars is empty, the function removes all whitespace characters from the end of text using the rstrip method.
The function then checks if the resulting string is empty.
If it is empty, the function returns '-'.
Otherwise, the function returns the resulting string.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f("hi")```?First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
