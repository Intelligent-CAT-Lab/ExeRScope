The function f takes a string text as input and returns True if the string ends with one of the characters '.', '!', or '?', and False otherwise.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input '. C.', we need to check if the string ends with one of the characters '.', '!', or '?'.
Since the string '. C.' ends with '.', the function returns True.
<<<Output>>>
True

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f("hi")```?First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
