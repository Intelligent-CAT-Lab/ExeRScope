The function f takes two arguments: a dictionary d and a list get_ary.
The function iterates over the elements of get_ary and appends the value associated with each element in get_ary in d to the result list.
If an element in get_ary is not a key in d, the value associated with that element in d is None.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input {3: "swims like a bull"}, [3, 2, 'c', True, 5], we need to iterate over the elements of [3, 2, 'c', True, 5] and append the value associated with each element in {3: "swims like a bull"} to the result list.
Since 3 is a key in {3: "swims like a bull"}, the value associated with 3 in {3: "swims like a bull"} is "swims like a bull".
Since 2 is not a key in {3: "swims like a bull"}, the value associated with 2 in {3: "swims like a bull"} is None.
Since 'c' is not a key in {3: "swims like a bull"}, the value associated with 'c' in {3: "swims like a bull"} is None.
Since True is not a key in {3: "swims like a bull"}, the value associated with True in {3: "swims like a bull"} is None.
Since 5 is not a key in {3: "swims like a bull"}, the value associated with 5 in {3: "swims like a bull"} is None.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input {3: "swims like a bull"}, [3, 2, 'c', True, 5] is ["swims like a bull", None, None, None, None].
<<<Output>>>
["swims like a bull", None, None, None, None]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(d, get_ary):
    result = []
    for key in get_ary:
        result.append(d.get(key))
    return result
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f({3: "swims like a bull"}, [3, 2, 'c', True, 5])```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
