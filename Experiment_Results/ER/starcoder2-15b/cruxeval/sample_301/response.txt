The function f takes a list nums as input and returns the modified list nums.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [0, 6, 2, -1, -2], we need to analyze the code step by step.
The first line of the function f initializes the variable count to the length of the input list nums.
The second line of the function f iterates over the range of integers from -count+1 to 0, inclusive.
The third line of the function f appends the element nums[i] to the end of the list nums twice.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [0, 6, 2, -1, -2] is [0, 6, 2, -1, -2, -2, -1, -1, -2, -2].
<<<Output>>>
[0, 6, 2, -1, -2, -2, -1, -1, -2, -2]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(nums):
    count = len(nums)
    for i in range(-count+1, 0):
        nums.extend([nums[i], nums[i]])
    return nums
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f([0, 6, 2, -1, -2])```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
