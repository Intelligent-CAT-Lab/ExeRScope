The function f takes a string postcode as input and returns the substring of postcode starting from the index of the first occurrence of the character 'C'.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "ED20 CW", we need to find the index of the first occurrence of the character 'C' in the string "ED20 CW".
The index of the first occurrence of the character 'C' in the string "ED20 CW" is 5.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "ED20 CW" is "CW".
<<<Output>>>
'CW'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s[s.index('a'):]
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f('abracadabra')```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The function f takes a string s as input and returns the substring of s starting from the index of the first occurrence of the character 'a'.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "abracadabra", we need to find the index of the first occurrence of the character 'a' in the string "abracadabra".
The index of the first occurrence of the character 'a' in the string "abracadabra" is 0.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "abracadabra" is "abracadabra".
<<<Output>>>
