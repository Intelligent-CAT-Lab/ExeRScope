The function f takes two arguments: a list of numbers nums and a number val.
It creates an empty list new_list and then uses a list comprehension to extend new_list with the elements of nums repeated val times.
Finally, it returns the sum of the elements in new_list.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [10, 4] and 3, we need to first create an empty list new_list.
Then, we use a list comprehension to extend new_list with the elements of [10, 4] repeated 3 times.
This means that new_list will contain the elements 10, 10, 10, 4, 4, 4.
Finally, we return the sum of the elements in new_list, which is 42.
<<<Output>>>
42

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(nums):
    return [i for i in nums if i % 2 == 0]
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The function f takes a list of numbers nums as input and returns a new list containing only the even numbers from nums.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], we need to first create an empty list.
Then, we iterate through the elements of nums and add each even number to the list.
Finally, we return the list containing only the even numbers.
<<<Output>>>
[2, 4]
