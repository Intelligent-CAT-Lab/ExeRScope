The function f takes two arguments, s and c.
The first line of the function splits the string s into a list of words by splitting it on the space character.
The second line of the function returns the concatenation of the string c with two spaces, followed by the concatenation of the reversed list of words, separated by three spaces.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "Hello There" and "*", we need to split the string "Hello There" into a list of words by splitting it on the space character.
This results in a list of two words: ["Hello", "There"].
We then reverse this list of words and join them with three spaces between each word.
This results in the string "There Hello".
Finally, we concatenate the string "*" with two spaces and the reversed string "There Hello".
This results in the string "*  There Hello".
<<<Output>>>
'*  There Hello'
