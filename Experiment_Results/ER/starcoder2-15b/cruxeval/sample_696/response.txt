The function f takes a string text as input and returns the sum of the lengths of the prefixes of text.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "wdj", we need to calculate the sum of the lengths of the prefixes of "wdj".
The prefixes of "wdj" are "w", "wd", and "wdj".
The lengths of these prefixes are 1, 2, and 3, respectively.
Therefore, the sum of the lengths of the prefixes of "wdj" is 6.
<<<Output>>>
6

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s[0] + s[1] + s[2]
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f("hello")```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of the first three characters of s.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hello", we need to concatenate the first three characters of "hello".
The first three characters of "hello" are "hel".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hello" is "hel".
<<<Output>>>
'hel'
