The function f takes a list nums and an integer i as input.
It removes the element at index i from the list nums and returns the modified list.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [35, 45, 3, 61, 39, 27, 47] and 0, we need to remove the element at index 0 from the list [35, 45, 3, 61, 39, 27, 47].
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [35, 45, 3, 61, 39, 27, 47] and 0 is [45, 3, 61, 39, 27, 47].
<<<Output>>>
[45, 3, 61, 39, 27, 47]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(nums, i):
    nums.pop(i)
    return nums
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f([35, 45, 3, 61, 39, 27, 47], 1)```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
