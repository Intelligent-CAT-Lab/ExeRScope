The function f takes two arguments: text and chars.
If text is not empty, the function returns the result of calling the rstrip method on text with chars as the argument.
If text is empty, the function returns text.
In this case, text is 'ha' and chars is ''.
Since text is not empty, the function returns the result of calling the rstrip method on text with chars as the argument.
The rstrip method removes any trailing characters that are present in chars from the end of text.
Since chars is an empty string, no characters are removed from the end of text.
Therefore, the return value of f('ha', '') is 'ha'.
<<<Output>>>
'ha'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s.replace("a", "b")
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f("a")```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns a new string with all occurrences of the letter 'a' replaced with the letter 'b'.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "a", we need to replace all occurrences of the letter 'a' with the letter 'b' in the input string "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "a" is "b".
<<<Output>>>
'b'
