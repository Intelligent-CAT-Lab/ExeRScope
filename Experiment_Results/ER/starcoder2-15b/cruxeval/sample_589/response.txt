The function f takes a list num as input and returns the list num after appending the last element of num to the end of the list.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [-70, 20, 9, 1], we need to append the last element of [-70, 20, 9, 1] to the end of the list.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [-70, 20, 9, 1] is [-70, 20, 9, 1, 1].
<<<Output>>>
[-70, 20, 9, 1, 1]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f("hi")```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
