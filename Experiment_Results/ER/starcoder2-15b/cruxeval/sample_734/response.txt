The function f takes a list of integers nums as input and returns a modified version of nums.
The function iterates over the elements of nums in reverse order and removes any even numbers from the list.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [5, 3, 3, 7], we need to analyze the behavior of the function.
The function iterates over the elements of the list in reverse order and removes any even numbers from the list.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [5, 3, 3, 7] is [5, 3, 7].
<<<Output>>>
[5, 3, 7]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(nums):
    for i in range(len(nums) - 1):
        if nums[i] % 2 == 0:
            nums.remove(nums[i])
    return nums
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f([5, 3, 3, 7])```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
