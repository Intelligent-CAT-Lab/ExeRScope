The function f takes an array of arrays as input and returns a new array of arrays.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [[1, 2, 3], [], [1, 2, 3]], we need to analyze the code step by step.
The code initializes an empty array return_arr to store the output.
Then, it iterates over each array a in the input array.
For each array a, it creates a copy of a using the copy() method and appends the copy to return_arr.
Finally, it returns the array return_arr as the output.
<<<Output>>>
[[1, 2, 3], [], [1, 2, 3]]
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(array):
    return_arr = []
    for a in array:
        return_arr.append(a.copy())
    return return_arr
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f([[1, 2, 3], [], [1, 2, 3]])```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
