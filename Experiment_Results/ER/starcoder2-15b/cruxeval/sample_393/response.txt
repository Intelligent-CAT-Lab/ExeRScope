The function f takes a string text as input and returns a string text2.
The function first reverses the input string text and stores the reversed string in the variable ls.
Then, the function initializes an empty string text2.
The function then iterates over the reversed string ls in steps of 3 starting from the third-to-last character.
For each iteration, the function extracts a substring of length 3 from ls starting from the current index and joins the characters of the substring with '---'.
The resulting string is then appended to text2.
Finally, the function returns text2 without the last 3 characters.
<<<Output>>>
'---a---l---a---c---s'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f("hi")```?First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:

        text2 += '---'.join(ls[i:i + 3]) + '---'
    return text2[:-3]
