The function f takes a list of numbers nums as input and returns a new list new_nums.
The function first sorts the list nums in ascending order.
Then, it calculates the length of the list nums and assigns it to the variable n.
Next, it creates a new list new_nums and adds the middle element of nums to it.
If the length of nums is even, it adds the two middle elements of nums to new_nums.
Then, it iterates over the first half of nums in reverse order and adds each element to the beginning of new_nums.
Finally, it iterates over the second half of nums and adds each element to the end of new_nums.
The function returns the new list new_nums.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(nums):
    nums.sort()
    n = len(nums)
    new_nums = [nums[n//2]]
    
    if n % 2 == 0:
        new_nums = [nums[n//2 - 1], nums[n//2]]
    
    for i in range(0, n//2):
        new_nums.insert(0, nums[n-i-1])
        new_nums.append(nums[i])
    return new_nums
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f([1, 2, 3, 4])```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
