The function f takes two arrays arr1 and arr2 as input and returns a new array new_arr.
The function first creates a copy of arr1 and stores it in new_arr.
Then, the function extends new_arr with the elements of arr2.
Finally, the function returns new_arr.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [5, 1, 3, 7, 8] and ['', 0, -1, []], we need to create a copy of [5, 1, 3, 7, 8] and extend it with the elements of ['', 0, -1, []].
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [5, 1, 3, 7, 8] and ['', 0, -1, []] is [5, 1, 3, 7, 8, '', 0, -1, []].
<<<Output>>>
[5, 1, 3, 7, 8, '', 0, -1, []]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(arr):
    new_arr = []
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        if arr[i] % 2 == 0:
            new_arr.append(arr[i])
    return new_arr
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f([5, 1, 3, 7, 8])```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The function f takes an array arr as input and returns a new array new_arr.
The function first creates an empty array new_arr.
Then, the function iterates over the elements of arr using a for loop.
For each element, the function checks if the element is even.
If it is even, the function appends the element to new_arr.
Finally, the function returns new_arr.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [5, 1, 3, 7, 8], we need to iterate over the elements of [5, 1, 3, 7, 8] and check if each element is even.
Since 8 is even, it will be appended to new_arr.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [5, 1, 3, 7, 8] is [8].
<<<Output>>>
[8]
