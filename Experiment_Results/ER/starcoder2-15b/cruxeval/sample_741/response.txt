The function f takes two arguments: a list of numbers nums and an integer p.
The function first calculates the index of the previous element of p in the list nums.
If p is the first element of nums, then the previous element is the last element of nums.
Otherwise, the previous element is the element at index p - 1 in nums.
The function then returns the value of the previous element.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(nums):
    return [x * 2 for x in nums]
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The function f takes a list of numbers nums as input and returns a new list.
The new list is created by multiplying each element of nums by 2.
<<<Output>>>
[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
