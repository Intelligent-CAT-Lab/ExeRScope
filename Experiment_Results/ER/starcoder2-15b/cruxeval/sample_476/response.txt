The function f takes two arguments: a string a and a character split_on.
The function first splits the string a into a list of words using the split() method.
Then, it creates an empty list a and iterates over each word in the list of words.
For each word, it iterates over each character in the word and appends the character to the list a.
Finally, it checks if the character split_on is in the list a and returns True if it is, or False otherwise.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "booty boot-boot bootclass" and 'k', we need to split the string into a list of words, iterate over each word, iterate over each character in the word, and check if the character 'k' is in the list.
Since the character 'k' is not in the list, the function returns False.
<<<Output>>>
False

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(a, split_on):
    t = a.split()
    a = []
    for i in t:
        for j in i:
            a.append(j)
    if split_on in a:
        return True
    else:
        return False
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f("booty boot-boot bootclass", 'o')```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
