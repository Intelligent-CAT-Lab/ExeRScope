The function f takes a string sample as input and returns the index of the last occurrence of the character '/' in the substring of sample from the beginning to the index i.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'present/here/car%2Fwe', we need to find the index of the last occurrence of the character '/' in the substring of 'present/here/car%2Fwe' from the beginning to the index i.
We can find the index of the last occurrence of the character '/' in the substring of 'present/here/car%2Fwe' from the beginning to the index i by using the rindex method of the string class.
The rindex method takes three arguments: the string to search, the start index, and the end index.
In this case, the string to search is 'present/here/car%2Fwe', the start index is 0, and the end index is i.
