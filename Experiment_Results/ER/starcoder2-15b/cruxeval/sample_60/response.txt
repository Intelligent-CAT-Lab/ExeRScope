The function f takes a string doc as input and returns the first alphabetical character in doc, capitalized.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "raruwa", we need to iterate through the characters in "raruwa" and find the first alphabetical character.
The first alphabetical character in "raruwa" is "r", which is capitalized to "R".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "raruwa" is "R".
<<<Output>>>
'R'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f("hi")```?First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
