The function f takes a string as input and returns the index of the rightmost occurrence of the character 'e' in the string.
If the string does not contain the character 'e', the function returns the string "Nuk".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "eeuseeeoehasa", we need to find the index of the rightmost occurrence of the character 'e' in the string.
Since the character 'e' occurs at index 12 in the string, the output of executing the function f on the input "eeuseeeoehasa" is 12.
<<<Output>>>
12

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f("hi")```?First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
