The function f takes an array and an element as input and returns the index of the element in the array.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [5, -3, 3, 2] and 2, we need to find the index of 2 in the array [5, -3, 3, 2].
The array is reversed twice, so the order of the elements is reversed twice.
Therefore, the index of 2 in the array is 3.

[END-OF-RESPONSE]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(array, elem):
    array.reverse()
    try:
        found = array.index(elem)
    finally:
        array.reverse()
    return found
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f([5, -3, 3, 2], 2)```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
