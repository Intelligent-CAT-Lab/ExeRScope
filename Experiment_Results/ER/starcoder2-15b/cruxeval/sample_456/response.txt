The function f takes two arguments: a string s and an integer tab.
It returns the result of calling the expandtabs method on the string s with the argument tab.
The expandtabs method replaces each tab character in the string with one or more spaces, depending on the value of the tab argument.
In this case, the tab argument is 4, so each tab character in the string "Join us in Hungary" will be replaced with 4 spaces.
<<<Output>>>
'Join us in Hungary'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s.split()

What would be the return value of ```f("Join us in Hungary")```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The function f takes a string s as input and returns the result of calling the split method on the string s.
The split method splits the string s into a list of substrings based on the whitespace characters in the string.
In this case, the string "Join us in Hungary" is split into a list of three substrings: "Join", "us", and "in Hungary".
<<<Output>>>
['Join', 'us', 'in Hungary']

The function f takes a string s as input and returns the result of calling the split method on the string s with the argument "in".
The split method splits the string s into a list of substrings based on the occurrence of the substring "in" in the string.
In this case, the string "Join us in Hungary" is split into a list of two substrings: "Join us " and " Hungary".
<<<Output>>>
['Join us ', ' Hungary']

The function f takes a string s as input and returns the result of calling the split method on the string s with the arguments "in" and 1.
The split method splits the string s into a list of substrings based on the occurrence of the substring "in" in the string, but it only splits the string once.
In this case, the string "Join us in Hungary" is split into a list of two substrings: "Join us " and " Hungary".
<<<Output>>>
['Join us ', ' Hungary']
