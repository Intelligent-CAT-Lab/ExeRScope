The function f takes a string text as input and returns True if the string text contains only whitespace characters, and False otherwise.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "     i", we need to analyze the code step by step.
First, the function iterates over each character in the string "     i" using a for loop.
For each character, the function checks if the character is a whitespace character using the isspace() method.
If the character is not a whitespace character, the function returns False.
If the function reaches the end of the string without encountering a non-whitespace character, it returns True.
In this case, the function encounters a non-whitespace character 'i' at the end of the string, so it returns False.
<<<Output>>>
False

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f("hi")```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
