The function f takes three arguments: text, space_symbol, and size.
The function returns the concatenation of text with a string of size-len(text) space_symbol characters.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input ('w', '))', 7), we need to concatenate 'w' with a string of 7-len('w') ')' characters.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input ('w', '))', 7) is 'w)))))))'.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"

<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f("hi")```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
