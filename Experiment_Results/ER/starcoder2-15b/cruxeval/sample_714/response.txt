The function f takes an array as input and performs several operations on it.
The first operation is to reverse the array.
The second operation is to clear the array.
The third operation is to extend the array with the string 'x' repeated len(array) times.
The fourth operation is to reverse the array again.
The last operation is to return the array.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [3, -2, 0], we need to perform the above operations on the input array.
First, we reverse the array to get [0, -2, 3].
Then, we clear the array to get [].
Next, we extend the array with the string 'x' repeated len(array) times, which is 3 times.
Therefore, the array becomes ['x', 'x', 'x'].
Finally, we reverse the array again to get ['x', 'x', 'x'].
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [3, -2, 0] is ['x', 'x', 'x'].
<<<Output>>>
['x', 'x', 'x']

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(x):
    return x + 1
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f(2)```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes an integer x as input and returns the value of x + 1.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 2, we need to add 1 to the input 2.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 2 is 3.
