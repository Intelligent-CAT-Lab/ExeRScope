The function f takes two arguments: text and prefix.
It returns the substring of text starting from the index len(prefix).
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input '123x John z' and 'z', we need to find the substring of '123x John z' starting from the index len('z').
Since len('z') is 1, the substring of '123x John z' starting from the index 1 is '123x John '.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input '123x John z' and 'z' is '123x John '.
<<<Output>>>
'123x John '

What would be the return value of ```f("hi")```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The function f takes a string s as input and returns the substring of s starting from the index 1.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to find the substring of "hi" starting from the index 1.
Since "hi" is a string of length 2, the substring of "hi" starting from the index 1 is "i".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "i".
<<<Output>>>
'i'
