The function f takes an array and an element as input and returns the index of the element in the array if it exists, or -1 if it does not exist.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [6, 2, 7, 1] and 6, we need to check if 6 is in the array [6, 2, 7, 1].
Since 6 is in the array, we return the index of 6 in the array, which is 0.
<<<Output>>>
0

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(array, elem):
    if elem in array:
        return array.index(elem)
    return -1
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f([6, 2, 7, 1], 3)```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
