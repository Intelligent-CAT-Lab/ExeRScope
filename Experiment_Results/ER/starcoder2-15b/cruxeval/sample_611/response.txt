The function f takes a list nums as input and reverses the order of the elements in the list.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [-6, -2, 1, -3, 0, 1], we need to reverse the order of the elements in the list.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [-6, -2, 1, -3, 0, 1] is [1, 0, -3, 1, -2, -6].
<<<Output>>>
[1, 0, -3, 1, -2, -6]
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(nums):
    nums[:] = nums[::-1]
    return nums
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
