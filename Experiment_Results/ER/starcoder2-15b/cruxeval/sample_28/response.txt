The function f takes a list mylist as input and returns True if the list is sorted in descending order and False otherwise.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [5, 8], we need to analyze the code step by step.
First, the function creates a copy of the input list using the slice notation mylist[:].
Then, it reverses the copy using the reverse() method.
Next, it sorts the input list in descending order using the sort() method with the reverse parameter set to True.
Finally, it returns True if the input list is equal to the reversed copy, and False otherwise.
Since the input list is not sorted in descending order, the function returns False.
<<<Output>>>
False
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(mylist):
    revl = mylist[:]
    revl.reverse()
    mylist.sort(reverse=True)
    return mylist == revl
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f([8, 5])```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
