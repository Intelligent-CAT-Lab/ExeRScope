The function f takes a string text as input and returns the string text converted to uppercase if the number of uppercase letters in text is greater than or equal to 10, otherwise it returns the original string text.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "?XyZ", we need to analyze the number of uppercase letters in the string "?XyZ".
There are 2 uppercase letters in the string "?XyZ", which is less than 10.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "?XyZ" is "?XyZ".
<<<Output>>>
'?XyZ'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f("hi")```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
