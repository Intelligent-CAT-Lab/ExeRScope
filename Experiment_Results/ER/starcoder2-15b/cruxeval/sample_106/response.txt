The function f takes a list of numbers nums as input and returns the modified list nums.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [2, 8, -2, 9, 3, 3], we need to analyze the code step by step.
The first line of the function f initializes the variable count to the length of the input list nums.
The second line of the function f iterates over the range from 0 to count, which is the length of the input list nums.
For each iteration, the function f inserts the value of nums[i] * 2 at the index i in the list nums.
The third line of the function f returns the modified list nums.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [2, 8, -2, 9, 3, 3] is [4, 2, 16, 4, -4, 18, 6, 6, 6].
<<<Output>>>
[4, 2, 16, 4, -4, 18, 6, 6, 6]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(nums):
    count = len(nums)
    for i in range(0, count):
        nums.insert(i, nums[i]*2)
    return nums
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f([2, 8, -2, 9, 3, 3])```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
