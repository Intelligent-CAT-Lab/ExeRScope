The function f takes an integer num as input and returns the string "Half Life" if num is between 0 and 1000 (inclusive) and not equal to 6174.
Otherwise, it returns the string "Not found".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 6173, we need to check if 6173 is between 0 and 1000 (inclusive) and not equal to 6174.
Since 6173 is between 0 and 1000 (inclusive) and not equal to 6174, the function returns the string "Half Life".
<<<Output>>>
'Half Life'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(num):
    if num > 100:
        return 'Bigger than 100'
    elif num < 100:
        return 'Smaller than 100'
    else:
        return 'Equal to 100'
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f(100)```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The function f takes an integer num as input and returns the string "Bigger than 100" if num is greater than 100, "Smaller than 100" if num is less than 100, and "Equal to 100" if num is equal to 100.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 100, we need to check if 100 is greater than 100, less than 100, or equal to 100.
Since 100 is equal to 100, the function returns the string "Equal to 100".
<<<Output>>>
'Equal to 100'

What would be the return value of ```f(101)```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The function f takes an integer num as input and returns the string "Bigger than 100" if num is greater than 100, "Smaller than 100" if num is less than 100, and "Equal to 100" if num is equal to 100.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 101, we need to check if 101 is greater than 100, less than 100, or equal to 100.
Since 101 is greater than 100, the function returns the string "Bigger than 100".

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 99, we need to check if 99 is greater than 100, less than 100, or equal to 100.
Since 99 is less than 100, the function returns the string "Smaller than 10
