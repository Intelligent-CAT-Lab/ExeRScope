The function f takes two arguments: an array and an element.
The function creates a copy of the array and stores it in the variable result.
The function then enters a while loop, which will continue to execute as long as result is not empty.
Inside the while loop, the function pops the last item from result and stores it in the variables key and value.
It then checks if elem is equal to key or value.
If it is, the function updates result with the original array and then deletes the key from result.
Finally, the function returns result.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(array, elem):
    result = array.copy()
    while result:
        key, value = result.popitem()
        if elem == key or elem == value:
            result.update(array)
        del result[key]
    return result
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f({"a": 1, "b": 2}, 1)```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
