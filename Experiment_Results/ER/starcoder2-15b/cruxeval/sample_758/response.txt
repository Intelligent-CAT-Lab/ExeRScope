The function f takes a list nums as input and returns True if the list is a palindrome and False otherwise.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [0, 3, 6, 2], we need to check if the list is a palindrome.
Since the list is not a palindrome, the function returns False.
<<<Output>>>
False
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(nums):
    if nums[::-1] == nums:
        return True
    return False
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f([0, 3, 6, 3, 0])```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
