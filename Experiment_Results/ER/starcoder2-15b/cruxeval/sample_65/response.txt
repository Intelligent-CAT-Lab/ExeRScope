The function f takes a list nums and an integer index as input and returns the result of performing some operations on the elements of nums.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [3, 2, 0, 3, 7] and 3, we need to analyze the code step by step.
First, the function accesses the element at index 3 in nums, which is 3.
Then, the function removes the element at index 3 from nums, which results in the list [3, 2, 0, 7].
Next, the function performs the operation nums[index] % 42 + nums.pop(index) * 2, which is equivalent to 3 % 42 + 3 * 2 = 9.
Finally, the function returns the result of this operation, which is 9.
<<<Output>>>
9

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(nums):
    return nums[0] + nums[1]

<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f([1, 2, 3])```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The function f takes a list nums as input and returns the sum of the first two elements of nums.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 2, 3], we need to analyze the code step by step.
First, the function accesses the first element of nums, which is 1.
Then, the function accesses the second element of nums, which is 2.
Next, the function adds these two elements together, resulting in 3.
Finally, the function returns the result of this operation, which is 3.
