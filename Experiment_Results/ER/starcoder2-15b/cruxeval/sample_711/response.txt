The function f takes a string text as input and returns the result of replacing all occurrences of the newline character '\n' with the tab character '\t' in text.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'apples\n\t\npears\n\t\nbananas', we need to replace all occurrences of the newline character '\n' with the tab character '\t' in the input string.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'apples\n\t\npears\n\t\nbananas' is 'apples\t\t\tpears\t\t\tbananas'.
<<<Output>>>
'apples\t\t\tpears\t\t\tbananas'
