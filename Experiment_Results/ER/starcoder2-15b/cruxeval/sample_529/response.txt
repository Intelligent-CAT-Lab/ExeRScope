The function f takes an array as input and returns a new array.
The function f creates a new array newArray by copying the elements of the input array array.
The function f then iterates over the elements of the input array array, starting from the second element.
For each element, the function f checks if the previous element is equal to the current element.
If the previous element is not equal to the current element, the function f sets the corresponding element in the new array newArray to the current element.
If the previous element is equal to the current element, the function f deletes the corresponding element from the new array newArray.
Finally, the function f returns the new array newArray.
<<<Output>>>
[1, 2, 3]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(array):
    newArray = []
    for i in range(len(array)):
        if array[i] % 2 == 0:
            newArray.append(array[i])
    return newArray
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f([1, 2, 3])```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The function f takes an array as input and returns a new array.
The function f creates a new array newArray.
The function f then iterates over the elements of the input array array.
For each element, the function f checks if the element is even.
If the element is even, the function f appends the element to the new array newArray.
Finally, the function f returns the new array newArray.
