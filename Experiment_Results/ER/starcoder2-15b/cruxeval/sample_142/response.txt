The function f takes a string x as input and returns the reversed string x if x is not lowercase.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "ykdfhp", we need to check if the string "ykdfhp" is lowercase.
Since the string "ykdfhp" is not lowercase, the function f returns the reversed string "ykdfhp".
<<<Output>>>
'phdfky'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(x):
    if x.islower():
        return x
    else:
        return x[::-1]
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f('ykdfhp')```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
