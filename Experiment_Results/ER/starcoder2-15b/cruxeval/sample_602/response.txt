The function f takes two arguments: nums, which is a list of integers, and target, which is an integer.
The function first counts the number of occurrences of target in nums using the count method.
It then multiplies this count by 2 and returns the result.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 1] and 1, we need to count the number of occurrences of 1 in [1, 1] and multiply it by 2.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 1] and 1 is 2.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(nums):
    return sum(nums)
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f([1, 2, 3])```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The function f takes a list of integers as input and returns the sum of all the integers in the list.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 2, 3], we need to sum all the integers in the list [1, 2, 3].
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 2, 3] is 6.
