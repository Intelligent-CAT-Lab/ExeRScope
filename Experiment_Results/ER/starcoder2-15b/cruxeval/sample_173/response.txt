The function f takes a list list_x as input and returns a new list.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [5, 8, 6, 8, 4], we need to analyze the code step by step.
First, the function f initializes a variable item_count to the length of the input list list_x.
Then, it initializes a new list new_list to an empty list.
Next, the function f iterates over the range of item_count using a for loop.
Inside the for loop, the function f appends the last element of the input list list_x to the new list new_list using the pop() method.
Finally, the function f returns the new list new_list.
<<<Output>>>
[4, 8, 6, 8, 5]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(list_x):
    item_count = len(list_x)
    new_list = []
    for i in range(item_count):
        new_list.append(list_x.pop())
    return new_list
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f([5, 8, 6, 8, 4])```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
