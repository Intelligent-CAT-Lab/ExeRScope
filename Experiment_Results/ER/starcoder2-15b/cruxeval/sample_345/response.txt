The function f takes two arguments a and b.
If a is less than b, the function returns a tuple containing b and a in that order.
Otherwise, the function returns a tuple containing a and b in that order.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input ('ml', 'mv'), we need to compare 'ml' and 'mv'.
Since 'ml' is less than 'mv', the function returns a tuple containing 'mv' and 'ml' in that order.
<<<Output>>>
('mv', 'ml')

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(a, b):
    if a < b:
        return (b, a)
    return (a, b)
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f('ml', 'mv')```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
