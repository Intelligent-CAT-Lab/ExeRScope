The function f takes a string s as input and returns the reverse of the string s after removing leading and trailing whitespace.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "   OOP   ", we need to remove leading and trailing whitespace from "   OOP   " and then reverse the resulting string.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "   OOP   " is "PPO   ".
<<<Output>>>
'PPO   '
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    arr = list(s.strip())
    arr.reverse()
    return ''.join(arr)
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f('   OOP   ')```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
