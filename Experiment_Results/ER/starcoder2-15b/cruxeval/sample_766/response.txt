The function f takes two arguments: a list of strings values and an integer value.
It first calculates the length of the list values using the len function.
Then, it creates a new dictionary new_dict using the dict.fromkeys method, which takes two arguments: a list of keys and a value.
The keys are the strings in the list values, and the value is the integer value.
Next, it adds a new key-value pair to the dictionary new_dict.
The key is the concatenation of the sorted strings in the list values, and the value is the integer value multiplied by 3.
Finally, it returns the dictionary new_dict.
<<<Output>>>
{'03': 351, '30': 351, '0': 117, '3': 117}

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(values, value):
    length = len(values)
    new_dict = dict.fromkeys(values, value)
    new_dict[''.join(sorted(values))] = value * 3
    return new_dict
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f(['0','3'], 117)```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
