The function f takes three numbers as input and returns a string representation of the numbers in sorted order.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 6, 8, and 8, we need to sort the numbers 6, 8, and 8 in ascending order.
Since 6 is the smallest number, it will be placed first in the string representation.
Since 8 is the second smallest number, it will be placed second in the string representation.
Since 8 is the third smallest number, it will be placed third in the string representation.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 6, 8, and 8 is "6,8,8".
<<<Output>>>
'6,8,8'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(num1, num2, num3):
    nums = [num1, num2, num3]
    nums.sort()    
    return f'{nums[0]},{nums[1]},{nums[2]}'
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f(6,8,8)```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
