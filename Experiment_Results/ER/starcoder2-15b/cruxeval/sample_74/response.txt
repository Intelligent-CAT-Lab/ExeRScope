The function f takes a list lst, an integer i, and an integer n as input.
It inserts the integer n into the list lst at the index i and then returns the modified list lst.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [44, 34, 23, 82, 24, 11, 63, 99], 4, and 15, we need to insert the integer 15 into the list [44, 34, 23, 82, 24, 11, 63, 99] at the index 4.
After inserting the integer 15 into the list, the list becomes [44, 34, 23, 82, 15, 24, 11, 63, 99].
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [44, 34, 23, 82, 24, 11, 63, 99], 4, and 15 is [44, 34, 23, 82, 15, 24, 11, 63, 99].
<<<Output>>>
[44, 34, 23, 82, 15, 24, 11, 63, 99]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(lst, i, n):
    lst.insert(i, n)
    return lst
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f([44, 34, 23, 82, 24, 11, 63, 99], 4, 15)```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
