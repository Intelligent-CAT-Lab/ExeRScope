The function f takes a string text as input and returns a string containing only the digits from text.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input '-123   \t+314', we need to extract the digits from the input string.
The function str.isnumeric is used to check if a character is a digit.
The filter function is used to filter out the characters that are not digits.
The resulting list of digits is converted to a string using the join function.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input '-123   \t+314' is '123314'.
<<<Output>>>
'123314'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f("hi")```?First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
