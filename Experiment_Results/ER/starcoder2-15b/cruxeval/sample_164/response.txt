The function f takes a list lst as input and returns the first three elements of the sorted list lst.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [5, 8, 1, 3, 0], we need to sort the list [5, 8, 1, 3, 0] and then take the first three elements of the sorted list.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [5, 8, 1, 3, 0] is [0, 1, 3].
<<<Output>>>
[0, 1, 3]
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(lst):
    lst.sort()
    return lst[0:3]
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f([5, 8, 1, 3, 0])```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
