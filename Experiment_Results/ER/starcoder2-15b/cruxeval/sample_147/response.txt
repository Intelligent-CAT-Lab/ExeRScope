The function f takes a list nums as input and returns a new list.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 1, 1], we need to analyze the code step by step.
First, we need to find the middle index of the list nums.
Since the length of nums is 3, the middle index is 1.
Next, we need to concatenate the elements from the middle index to the end of nums with the elements from the beginning to the middle index of nums.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 1, 1] is [1, 1, 1].
<<<Output>>>
[1, 1, 1]
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(nums):
    return nums[1:] + nums[0:1]
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f([1, 1, 1])```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
