The function f takes an array of elements as input and returns a new array containing only the elements that are ASCII characters or integers that do not contain any non-ASCII characters.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input ["a", "b", "c"], we need to iterate through each element in the input array and check if it is an ASCII character or an integer that does not contain any non-ASCII characters.
If an element is an ASCII character or an integer that does not contain any non-ASCII characters, it is added to the result array.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input ["a", "b", "c"] is ["a", "b", "c"].
<<<Output>>>
['a', 'b', 'c']

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(array):
    result = []
    for elem in array:
        if elem.isascii() or (isinstance(elem, int) and not str(abs(elem)).isascii()):
            result.append(elem)
    return result
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f(["a", "b", "c", 123])```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
