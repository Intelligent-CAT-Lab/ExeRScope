The function f takes a string text as input and returns either the string 'integer' or the string 'string'.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input '', we need to analyze the code step by step.
First, the function checks if the input text is alphanumeric using the isalnum() method.
Since the input text is an empty string, it is not alphanumeric.
Therefore, the function returns the string 'string'.
<<<Output>>>
'string'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(x):
    if x == 0:
        return 0
    return f(x - 1) + x
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f(3)```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes an integer x as input and returns an integer.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 3, we need to analyze the code step by step.
First, the function checks if x is equal to 0.
Since x is not equal to 0, the function returns the result of calling itself with x - 1 as the input.
This means that the function will recursively call itself until x is equal to 0.
When x is equal to 0, the function returns 0.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 3 is 6.
<<<Output>>>
6

What would be the return value of ```f(4)```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes an integer x as input and returns an integer.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 4, we need to analyze the code step by step.
First, the function checks if x is equal to 0.
Since x is not equal to 0, the function returns the result of calling itself with x - 1 as the input.
This means that the function will recursively call itself until x is equal to 0.
When x is equal to 0, the function returns 0.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 4 is 10.
<<<Output>>>

What would be the return value of ```f(5)```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The function f takes an integer x as input and returns an integer.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 5, we need to analyze the code step by step.

Since x is not equal to 0, the function returns the result of calling itself with x - 1 as the input.
This means that the function will recursively call itself until x is equal to 0.
When x is equal to 0, the function returns 0.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 5 is 15.
