The function f takes three inputs: n, m, and num.
The function creates a list x_list that contains all integers from n to m, inclusive.
The function then initializes a variable j to 0.
The function then enters a while loop that runs indefinitely.
Inside the while loop, the function calculates j as (j + num) % len(x_list).
This means that j is updated to be the remainder of (j + num) divided by the length of x_list.
The function then checks if the element at index j in x_list is even.
If it is, the function returns that element.
If it is not, the function continues to the next iteration of the while loop.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input (46, 48, 21), we need to analyze how the function processes the input.
The function creates a list x_list that contains all integers from 46 to 48, inclusive.
The function then initializes a variable j to 0.
The function then enters a while loop that runs indefinitely.
Inside the while loop, the function calculates j as (0 + 21) % 3 = 0.
This means that j is updated to be 0.
The function then checks if the element at index 0 in x_list is even.
Since x_list[0] = 46, which is not even, the function continues to the next iteration of the while loop.
Inside the while loop, the function calculates j as (0 + 21) % 3 = 0.
This means that j is updated to be 0.
The function then checks if the element at index 0 in x_list is even.
Since x_list[0] = 46, which is not even, the function continues to the next iteration of the while loop.
Inside the while loop, the function calculates j as (0 + 21) % 3 = 0.
This means that j is updated to be 0.
