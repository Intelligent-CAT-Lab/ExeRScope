The function f takes a string as input and returns a string.
The function first checks if the string is empty or if the first character of the string is not a numeric character.
If either of these conditions is true, the function returns the string 'INVALID'.
If both conditions are false, the function initializes a variable cur to 0 and then iterates over each character in the string.
For each character, the function multiplies cur by 10 and adds the integer value of the current character to cur.
Finally, the function returns the string representation of cur.
<<<Output>>>
'3'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    if not s:
        return 'INVALID'
    return s[0] + s[-1]
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f('hi')```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The function f takes a string s as input and returns a string.
The function first checks if the string s is empty.
If it is empty, the function returns the string 'INVALID'.
If the string s is not empty, the function returns the concatenation of the first and last characters of the string s.
