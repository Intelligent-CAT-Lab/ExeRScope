The function f takes a list lst as input and returns a copy of lst.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 2, 3, 4], we need to analyze the code step by step.
First, we initialize a new list res to store the even numbers in lst.
Then, we iterate over the indices of lst using a for loop.
For each index i, we check if the corresponding element lst[i] is even.
If it is, we append it to res.
Finally, we return a copy of lst using the copy method.
Since the function does not modify lst, the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 2, 3, 4] is [1, 2, 3, 4].
<<<Output>>>
[1, 2, 3, 4]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(lst):
    res = []
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        if lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            res.append(lst[i])

    return res
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f([1, 2, 3, 4])```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
