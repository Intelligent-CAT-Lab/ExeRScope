The function f takes a string s as input and returns a new string that contains only the whitespace characters from s.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input '\ngiyixjkvu\n\r\r \frgjuo', we need to analyze the code step by step.
First, the function f creates a list comprehension that iterates over each character c in the input string s.
The list comprehension checks if each character c is a whitespace character using the isspace() method.
If c is a whitespace character, it is added to the list.
The list comprehension returns a list of all the whitespace characters in s.
Next, the function f uses the join() method to concatenate all the whitespace characters in the list into a single string.
The join() method takes a list of strings as input and returns a single string that is the concatenation of all the strings in the list.
In this case, the list of strings is the list of whitespace characters returned by the list comprehension.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input '\ngiyixjkvu\n\r\r \frgjuo' is a string that contains only the whitespace characters from the input string.
<<<Output>>>
'\n\n\r\r \f'

<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f( '1234567890abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ')```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The function f takes a string s as input and returns a new string that contains only the alphabetic characters from s.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input '1234567890abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', we need to analyze the code step by step.
First, the function f creates a list comprehension that iterates over each character c in the input string s.
The list comprehension checks if each character c is an alphabetic character using the isalpha() method.
If c is an alphabetic character, it is added to the list.
The list comprehension returns a list of all the alphabetic characters in s.
Next, the function f uses the join() method to concatenate all the alphabetic characters in the list into a single string.
The join() method takes a list of strings as input and returns a single string that is the concatenation of all the strings in the list.
In this case, the list of strings is the list of alphabetic characters returned by the list comprehension.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input '1234567890abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' is a string that contains only the alphabetic characters from the input string.
<<<Output>>>
'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'

The function f takes a string s as input and returns a new string that contains only the numeric characters from s.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input '1234567890abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', we need to analyze the code step by step.
First, the function f creates a list comprehension that iterates over each character c in the input string s.
The list comprehension checks if each character c is a numeric character using the isdigit() method.
If c is a numeric character, it is added to the list.
The list comprehension returns a list of all the numeric characters in s.
Next, the function f uses the join() method to concatenate all the numeric characters in the list into a single string.
The join() method takes a list of strings as
