The function f takes two arguments: a list of numbers nums and a target number target.
The function first initializes two empty lists lows and higgs.
Then, the function iterates over each number i in nums.
For each number i, the function checks if i is less than target.
If i is less than target, the function appends i to the list lows.
Otherwise, the function appends i to the list higgs.
After the iteration, the function clears the list lows.
Finally, the function returns the tuple (lows, higgs).

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(nums):
    return [i for i in nums if i % 2 == 0]
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The function f takes a list of numbers nums as input.
The function returns a list of numbers that are even in nums.
To do this, the function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each number i in nums.
For each number i, the function checks if i is even by checking if i % 2 == 0.
If i is even, the function adds i to the list.
Finally, the function returns the list of even numbers.
<<<Output>>>
[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
