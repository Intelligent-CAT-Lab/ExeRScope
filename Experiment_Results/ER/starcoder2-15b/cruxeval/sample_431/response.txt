The function f takes two integers n and m as input and returns a list.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 1 and 3, we need to analyze the code step by step.
First, we create a list arr that contains the numbers from 1 to n (inclusive).
Then, we iterate m times and clear the list arr.
Since n is 1 and m is 3, the list arr will be cleared 3 times.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 1 and 3 is an empty list.

What would be the return value of ```f(3)```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The function f takes an integer n as input and returns an integer.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 3, we need to analyze the code step by step.
First, we check if n is 0. Since n is not 0, we recursively call the function f with n-1 as input.
This will result in a recursive call to f(2), which will result in a recursive call to f(1), which will result in a recursive call to f(0).
Since n is 0 in the last recursive call, the function will return 0.
Then, we add n to the return value of the recursive call, which is 0.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 3 is 6.
<<<Output>>>
