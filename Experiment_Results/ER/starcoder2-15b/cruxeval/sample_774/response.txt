The function f takes two arguments: num and name.
It creates a string f_str that contains a format string with two placeholders: {}.
The format method is called on f_str with two arguments: name and num.
The format method replaces the first placeholder with the value of name and the second placeholder with the value of num.
The return value of the function f is the formatted string f_str.
<<<Output>>>
'quiz leader = Cornareti, count = 23'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(num, name):
    f_str = 'quiz leader = {}, count = {}'
    return f_str.format(name, num)
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f(23, 'Cornareti')```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
