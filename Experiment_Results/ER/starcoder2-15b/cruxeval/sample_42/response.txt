The function f takes a list nums as input and modifies the list in-place.
It first clears the list nums by calling the clear method.
Then, it iterates over the elements of nums and appends the double of each element to the end of nums.
Finally, it returns the modified list nums.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [4, 3, 2, 1, 2, -1, 4, 2], we need to perform the following steps:
1. Clear the list [4, 3, 2, 1, 2, -1, 4, 2] by removing all its elements.
2. Iterate over the elements of the list [4, 3, 2, 1, 2, -1, 4, 2] and append the double of each element to the end of the list.
3. Return the modified list [4, 3, 2, 1, 2, -1, 4, 2].
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [4, 3, 2, 1, 2, -1, 4, 2] is [4, 3, 2, 1, 2, -1, 4, 2].
<<<Output>>>
[4, 3, 2, 1, 2, -1, 4, 2]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(nums):
    nums.clear()
    for num in nums:
        nums.append(num*2)
    return nums
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f([4, 3, 2, 1, 2, -1, 4, 2])```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
