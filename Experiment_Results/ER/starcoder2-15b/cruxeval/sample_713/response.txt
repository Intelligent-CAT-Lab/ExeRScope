The function f takes two arguments: text and char.
It first checks if char is in text using the in operator.
If char is in text, it splits text using char as the delimiter and strips any leading or trailing whitespace from each resulting substring.
It then checks if the length of the resulting list is greater than 1.
If it is, it returns True.
Otherwise, it returns False.
In this case, char is a space, and text is "only one line".
Since char is in text, it splits text using char as the delimiter, resulting in a list with one element: "only one line".
Since the length of the resulting list is not greater than 1, the function returns False.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f("hi")```?First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
