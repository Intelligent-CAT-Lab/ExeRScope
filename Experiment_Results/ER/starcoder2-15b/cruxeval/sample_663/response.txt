The function f takes two arguments: a container and a cron.
If the cron is not in the container, the function returns the container.
Otherwise, the function creates two new containers pref and suff.
The pref container contains all the elements of the container before the cron, and the suff container contains all the elements of the container after the cron.
The function then returns the concatenation of pref and suff.
In the case of the input ```f([], 2)```, the container is an empty list, and the cron is 2.
Since the cron is not in the container, the function returns the container, which is an empty list.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(container, cron):
    if not cron in container:
        return container
    pref = container[:container.index(cron)].copy()
    suff = container[container.index(cron) + 1:].copy()
    return pref + suff
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 3)```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
