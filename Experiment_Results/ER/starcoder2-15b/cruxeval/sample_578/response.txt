The function f takes a dictionary obj as input and returns the modified dictionary obj.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input {'R': 0, 'T': 3, 'F': -6, 'K': 0}, we need to analyze the code step by step.
The code iterates through the key-value pairs of the input dictionary.
For each key-value pair, if the value is greater than or equal to 0, the value is negated.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input {'R': 0, 'T': 3, 'F': -6, 'K': 0} is {'R': 0, 'T': -3, 'F': 6, 'K': 0}.
<<<Output>>>
{'R': 0, 'T': -3, 'F': 6, 'K': 0}

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f("hi")```?First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
