The function f takes a string line as input and returns a new string that contains only the alphanumeric characters from line.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input ```"\"\\%$ normal chars $%~ qwet42'"```, we need to analyze the code step by step.
First, we initialize an empty list a.
Then, we iterate over each character c in the input string.
For each character c, we check if it is alphanumeric using the isalnum() method.
If it is alphanumeric, we append it to the list a.
Finally, we return the concatenation of all the characters in a using the join() method.
In this case, the input string contains only alphanumeric characters, so the output of executing the function f on the input ```"\"\\%$ normal chars $%~ qwet42'"``` is ```"normalcharsqwet42"```.
<<<Output>>>
'normalcharsqwet42'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f("hi")```?First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
