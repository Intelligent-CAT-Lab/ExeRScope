The function f takes a string text as input and returns a new string out.
The function iterates through each character in text and checks if the character is uppercase.
If the character is uppercase, it is converted to lowercase and added to out.
If the character is lowercase, it is converted to uppercase and added to out.

<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f("hello")```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The function f takes a string s as input and returns the reverse of s.
To reverse a string, we can use the slice notation [::-1].
This notation means that we start from the end of the string and go backwards, taking every character.
