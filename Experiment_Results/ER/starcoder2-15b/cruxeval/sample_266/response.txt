The function f takes a list of numbers nums as input and returns the modified list nums.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [2, 3, 4, 6, -2], we need to analyze the code step by step.
The code iterates through the list nums in reverse order and inserts the odd numbers at the next index.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [2, 3, 4, 6, -2] is [2, 3, 3, 4, 6, -2, 6, -2].
<<<Output>>>
[2, 3, 3, 4, 6, -2, 6, -2]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(nums):
    for i in range(len(nums)-1, -1, -1):
        if nums[i] % 2 == 1:
            nums.insert(i+1, nums[i])
    return nums
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f([2, 3, 4, 6, -2])```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
