The function f takes a list nums as input and returns the modified list nums.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1], we need to analyze the code step by step.
The first line of the function f initializes the variable count to the length of the input list nums.
The second line of the function f iterates over the list [i % 2 for i in range(count)], which is a list of 0s and 1s.
For each element i in the list [i % 2 for i in range(count)], the third line of the function f appends the element nums[i] to the end of the list nums.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] is [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1, -1, 0, 0, 1, 1].
<<<Output>>>
[-1, 0, 0, 1, 1, -1, 0, 0, 1, 1]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(nums):
    count = len(nums)
    for i in [i % 2 for i in range(count)]:
        nums.append(nums[i])
    return nums
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
