The function f takes an array as input and returns the array after removing all negative numbers from it.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [], we need to remove all negative numbers from it.
Since there are no negative numbers in the input array, the output of executing the function f on the input [] is [].
<<<Output>>>
[]
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(array):
    for i in range(len(array)):
        if array[i] < 0:
            array.pop(i)
    return array
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f([1, 2, 3])```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The function f takes an array as input and returns the array after removing all negative numbers from it.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 2, 3], we need to remove all negative numbers from it.
Since there are no negative numbers in the input array, the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 2, 3] is [1, 2, 3].

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1, -2, 3, -4], we need to remove all negative numbers from it.
Since there are two negative numbers in the input array, we need to remove them both.
After removing the negative numbers, the output of executing the function f on the input [1, -2, 3, -4] is [1, 3].
