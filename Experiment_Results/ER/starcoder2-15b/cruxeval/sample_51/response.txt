The function f takes an integer num as input and returns either the string s or the integer num - 1.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 21, we need to check if 21 is even or odd.
Since 21 is odd, the function f returns the integer 21 - 1, which is 20.
<<<Output>>>
20

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f("hi")```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
