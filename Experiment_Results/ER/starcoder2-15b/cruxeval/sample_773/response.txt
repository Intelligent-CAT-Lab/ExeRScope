The function f takes a list nums and an integer n as input and returns the element at index n of nums after removing it from nums.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [-7, 3, 1, -1, -1, 0, 4] and 6, we need to remove the element at index 6 from the list [-7, 3, 1, -1, -1, 0, 4].
Since the index 6 is out of bounds for the list, the function f raises an IndexError.
<<<Output>>>
IndexError
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(nums, n):
    return nums.pop(n)
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f([-7, 3, 1, -1, -1, 0, 4], 3)```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [-7, 3, 1, -1, -1, 0, 4] and 3, we need to remove the element at index 3 from the list [-7, 3, 1, -1, -1, 0, 4].
The element at index 3 is -1, so the function f returns -1.
<<<Output>>>
-1

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [-7, 3, 1, -1, -1, 0, 4] and 0, we need to remove the element at index 0 from the list [-7, 3, 1, -1, -1, 0, 4].
The element at index 0 is -7, so the function f returns -7.
