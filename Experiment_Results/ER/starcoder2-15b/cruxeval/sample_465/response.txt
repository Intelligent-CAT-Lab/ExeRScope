The function f takes two arguments: seq and value.
The first line of the function creates a dictionary roles using the dict.fromkeys method.
The dict.fromkeys method takes two arguments: a sequence of keys and a default value.
In this case, the sequence of keys is seq, and the default value is 'north'.
The dict.fromkeys method creates a dictionary where each key in the sequence is mapped to the default value.
In this case, the dictionary roles will have a key for each element in the sequence seq, and each key will be mapped to the value 'north'.
The second line of the function checks if value is truthy.
If value is truthy, the function uses the update method to update the dictionary roles.
The update method takes a sequence of key-value pairs as input and updates the dictionary with those key-value pairs.
In this case, the sequence of key-value pairs is generated using a generator expression.
The generator expression takes each element in the sequence value.split(', ') and strips any leading or trailing whitespace from it.
The stripped elements are then used as keys in the dictionary roles, and the value for each key is set to 'north'.
The update method updates the dictionary roles with the key-value pairs generated by the generator expression.
In this case, the dictionary roles will be updated with the stripped elements of value as keys, and each key will be mapped to the value 'north'.
The function returns the updated dictionary roles.
<<<Output>>>
{'wise king': 'north', 'young king': 'north'}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(seq, value):
    roles = dict.fromkeys(seq, 'north')
    if value:
        roles.update(key.strip() for key in value.split(', '))
    return roles
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f(['wise king', 'young king'], 'wise king, young king')```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
