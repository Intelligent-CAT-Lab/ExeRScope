The function f takes a list nums, an integer spot, and an integer idx as input.
It inserts the value idx into the list nums at the index spot and then returns the modified list nums.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 0, 1, 1], 0, and 9, we need to insert the value 9 into the list [1, 0, 1, 1] at the index 0.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 0, 1, 1], 0, and 9 is [9, 1, 0, 1, 1].
<<<Output>>>
[9, 1, 0, 1, 1]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(nums, spot, idx):
    nums.insert(spot, idx)
    return nums
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f([1, 0, 1, 1], 0, 9)```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
