The function f takes two arguments: text and char.
It checks if text ends with char using the endswith method.
If it does not end with char, it calls itself recursively with the arguments char + text and char.
Otherwise, it returns text.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input ('staovk', 'k'), we need to analyze the code step by step.
First, we check if 'staovk' ends with 'k'.
Since it does not, we call f recursively with the arguments 'kstaovk' and 'k'.
Again, we check if 'kstaovk' ends with 'k'.
This time, it does, so we return 'kstaovk'.
<<<Output>>>
'kstaovk'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    if len(s) == 0:
        return s
    return f(s[1:]) + s[0]
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f('hello')```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The function f takes a string s as input.
It checks if the length of s is 0.
If it is, it returns s.
Otherwise, it calls itself recursively with the argument s[1:] + s[0].
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'hello', we need to analyze the code step by step.
First, we check if the length of 'hello' is 0.
Since it is not, we call f recursively with the argument 'elloh'.
Again, we check if the length of 'elloh' is 0.
This time, it is, so we return 'elloh'.
<<<Output>>>
'hello'
