The function f takes an array, an index, and a value as input.
It inserts the value index + 1 at the beginning of the array.
If the value is greater than or equal to 1, it inserts the value at the specified index in the array.
Finally, it returns the modified array.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [2], 0, 2, we need to perform the following steps:
1. Insert the value 0 + 1 = 1 at the beginning of the array [2]. The array becomes [1, 2].
2. Since the value 2 is greater than or equal to 1, insert the value 2 at the specified index 0 in the array [1, 2]. The array becomes [2, 1, 2].
3. Return the modified array [2, 1, 2].
<<<Output>>>
[2, 1, 2]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(array, index, value):
    array.insert(0, index + 1)
    if value >= 1:
        array.insert(index, value)
    return array
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f([2], 0, 2)```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
