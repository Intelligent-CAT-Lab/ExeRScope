The function f takes a list of letters as input and returns either "yes" or "no".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input ['b', 'i', 'r', 'o', 's', 'j', 'v', 'p'], we need to analyze the code step by step.
The code initializes a list a to an empty list.
Then, it iterates over the elements of the input list letters using a for loop.
For each element, it checks if the element is already in the list a.
If it is, it returns "no".
Otherwise, it appends the element to the list a.
After the for loop, it returns "yes".
<<<Output>>>
'yes'

Consider the following code:

def f(s):
    if len(s) == 0:
        return 0
    return f(s[1:]) + 1

<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f("hello")```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The function f takes a string s as input and returns an integer.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hello", we need to analyze the code step by step.
The code checks if the length of the input string s is 0.
If it is, it returns 0.
Otherwise, it calls itself recursively with the input string s[1:], which is the input string without the first character.
The function f is called recursively until the length of the input string is 0, at which point it returns 0.
The return value of the function f is the sum of the return values of all the recursive calls, which is equal to the length of the input string.

What would be the return value of ```f(3)```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes an integer n as input and returns an integer.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 3, we need to analyze the code step by step.
The code checks if the input integer n is 0.
If it is, it returns 1.
Otherwise, it calls itself recursively with the input integer n-1, which is the input integer minus 1.
The function f is called recursively until the input integer is 0, at which point it returns 1.
The return value of the function f is the sum of the return values of all the recursive calls, which is equal to 2^n.
