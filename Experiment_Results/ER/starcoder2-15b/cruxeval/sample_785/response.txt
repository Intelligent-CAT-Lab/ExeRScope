The function f takes an integer n as input and returns a string.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 1, we need to analyze the code step by step.
The code first initializes a variable streak to an empty string.
Then, it iterates over each character c in the string representation of n.
For each character c, it appends c.ljust(int(c) * 2) to streak.
Since n is 1, the string representation of n is "1".
Therefore, the code iterates over the character "1".
For the character "1", c.ljust(int(c) * 2) is "1".ljust(1 * 2), which is "1 ".
Therefore, the code appends "1 " to streak.
After the iteration, streak is "1 ".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 1 is "1 ".
<<<Output>>>
'1 '

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(n):
    streak = ''
    for c in str(n):
        streak += c.ljust(int(c) * 2)
    return streak
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f(12)```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

For the character "1", c.ljust(int(c) * 2) is "1".ljust(1 * 2), which is "1 ".
Therefore, the code appends "1 " to streak.
For the character "2", c.ljust(int(c) * 2) is "2".ljust(2 * 2), which is "22".
Therefore, the code appends "22" to streak.
After the iteration, streak is "1 22".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 12 is "1 22".

For each character c, it appends c.ljust(int(c) * 2) to streak.
Since n is 123, the string representation of n is "123".
Therefore, the code iterates over the characters "1", "2", and "3".
For the character "1", c.ljust(int(c) * 2) is "1".ljust(1 * 2), which is "1 ".
Therefore, the code appends "1 " to streak.
For the character "2", c.ljust(int(c) * 2) is "2".ljust(2 * 2), which is "22".
Therefore, the code appends "22" to streak.
For the character "3", c.ljust(int(c) * 2) is "3".ljust(3 * 2), which is "333".
