The function f takes a string text as input and returns either the string "yes" or the string "no".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "abc", we need to analyze the code inside the function.
The first line of the function checks if the input text is a decimal number using the isdecimal() method.
If the input text is a decimal number, the function returns the string "yes".
If the input text is not a decimal number, the function returns the string "no".
In this case, the input text "abc" is not a decimal number, so the function returns the string "no".
<<<Output>>>
'no'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(x):
    if x > 0:
        return x
    else:
        return -x
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f(-1)```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The function f takes an integer x as input and returns the absolute value of x.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input -1, we need to analyze the code inside the function.
The first line of the function checks if the input x is greater than 0.
If x is greater than 0, the function returns x.
If x is not greater than 0, the function returns -x.
In this case, the input x is -1, which is not greater than 0, so the function returns -x.
