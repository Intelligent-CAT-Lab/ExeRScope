The function f takes two arguments: text and sub.
It returns a list of indices where the substring sub occurs in the string text.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input ('egmdartoa', 'good'), we need to find the indices where the substring 'good' occurs in the string 'egmdartoa'.
We can do this by using the find method on the string 'egmdartoa' with the substring 'good' as the argument.
The find method returns the index of the first occurrence of the substring 'good' in the string 'egmdartoa', which is 4.
We can then append this index to the list index and increment the starting variable by the length of the substring 'good'.
We repeat this process until we find all occurrences of the substring 'good' in the string 'egmdartoa'.
In this case, there is only one occurrence of the substring 'good' in the string 'egmdartoa', so we append 4 to the list index and return it as the output of executing the function f on the input ('egmdartoa', 'good').

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f("hi")```?First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
