The function f takes an integer n as input and returns a list of strings.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 44, we need to analyze the code step by step.
First, the function f creates a list b by converting the integer n to a string and then splitting the string into a list of characters.
Next, the function f iterates over the elements of the list b starting from the third element (index 2) and adds a '+' character to each element.
Finally, the function f returns the modified list b.
<<<Output>>>
['4', '4', '+']
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(n):
    b = list(str(n))
    for i in range(2,len(b)): b[i] += '+'
    return b
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f(44)```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
