The function f takes a string as input and returns the title-case version of the string with all spaces removed.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "1oE-err bzz-bmm", we need to convert the string to title case and remove all spaces.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "1oE-err bzz-bmm" is "1OeErrBzzBmm".
<<<Output>>>
'1OeErrBzzBmm'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s.replace(' ', '')
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f('1oE-err bzz-bmm')```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
