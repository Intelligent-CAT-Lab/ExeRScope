The function f takes a string text as input and returns a modified version of text.
The function f first initializes a variable index to 1.
Then, it enters a while loop, which continues as long as index is less than the length of text.
Inside the while loop, the function f checks if the character at index is not equal to the character at index - 1.
If this condition is true, the function f increments index by 1 and continues the loop.
If the condition is false, the function f enters an else block.
In the else block, the function f creates two new strings text1 and text2.
text1 is the substring of text from index 0 to index - 1.
text2 is the substring of text from index to the end, with the case of each character swapped.
The function f then returns the concatenation of text1 and text2.
If the while loop completes without returning, the function f returns the result of swapping the case of each character in text.

Consider the following code:

        return s
    else:
        return f(s[1:]) + s[0]

What would be the return value of ```f('abc')```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The function f takes a string s as input and returns a reversed version of s.
If the length of s is 0, the function f returns s.
Otherwise, the function f calls itself recursively with the substring of s from index 1 to the end, and concatenates the result with the first character of s.
This process continues until the length of s is 0, at which point the function returns the empty string.
