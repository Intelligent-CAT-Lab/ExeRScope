The function f takes a list of strings as input and returns the number of strings in the list that are alphabetic.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input ['sharron', 'Savannah', ''], we need to count the number of strings in the list that are alphabetic.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input ['sharron', 'Savannah', ''] is 2.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f("hi")```?First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
