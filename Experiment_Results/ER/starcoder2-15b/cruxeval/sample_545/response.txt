The function f takes an array as input and returns a new array.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [8, 8, -4, -9, 2, 8, -1, 8], we need to analyze the code step by step.
The code initializes an empty array result and an integer index to 0.
Then, it enters a while loop, which continues as long as index is less than the length of the input array.
Inside the while loop, the code appends the last element of the input array to the result array, and then removes the last element from the input array.
The index is then incremented by 2.
After the while loop, the function returns the result array.
<<<Output>>>
[8, -1, 8, -9]
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(array):
    result = []
    for i in range(len(array)):
        if array[i] % 2 == 0:
            result.append(array[i])
    return result
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f([8, 8, -4, -9, 2, 8, -1, 8])```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [8, 8, -4, -9, 2, 8, -1, 8], we need to analyze the code step by step.
The code initializes an empty array result.
Then, it enters a for loop, which iterates over the indices of the input array.
Inside the for loop, the code checks if the element at the current index is even.
If it is, the element is appended to the result array.
After the for loop, the function returns the result array.
