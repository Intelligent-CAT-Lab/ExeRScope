The function f takes an array as input and returns a new array.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 2, 1], we need to analyze the code step by step.
First, the function creates a new array new_array by copying the input array.
Then, the function reverses the new_array.
Finally, the function returns a new array that contains the squares of the elements of new_array.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 2, 1] is [1, 4, 1].
<<<Output>>>
[1, 4, 1]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(x):
    if x > 0:
        return x
    else:
        return -x
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f(-1)```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The function f takes an integer x as input and returns the absolute value of x.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input -1, we need to analyze the code step by step.
First, the function checks if x is greater than 0. Since -1 is not greater than 0, the function goes to the else branch.
In the else branch, the function returns -x, which is the absolute value of -1.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input -1 is 1.

The function f takes an integer x as input and returns the absolute value of x.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 1, we need to analyze the code step by step.
First, the function checks if x is greater than 0. Since 1 is greater than 0, the function returns x, which is the absolute value of 1.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 1 is 1.

The function f takes an integer x as input and returns the absolute value of x.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 0, we need to analyze the code step by step.
First, the function checks if x is greater than 0. Since 0 is not greater than 0, the function goes to the else branch.
In the else branch, the function returns -x, which is the absolute value of 0.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 0 is 0.
<<<Output>>>
