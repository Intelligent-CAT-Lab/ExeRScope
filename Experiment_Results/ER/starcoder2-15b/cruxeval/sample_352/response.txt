The function f takes a list nums as input and returns the middle element of nums.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [-1, -3, -5, -7, 0], we need to find the middle element of the list [-1, -3, -5, -7, 0].
The length of the list is 5, so the middle index is 5 // 2 = 2.
Therefore, the middle element of the list is -5.
<<<Output>>>
-5

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(nums):
    return nums[len(nums)//2]
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f([-1, -3, -5, -7, 0])```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
