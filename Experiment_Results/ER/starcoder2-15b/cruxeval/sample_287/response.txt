The function f takes a string name as input and returns the string name after converting it to uppercase or lowercase depending on whether the string name is already in uppercase or lowercase.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "Pinneaple", we need to analyze the code step by step.
First, the function checks if the string name is in lowercase using the islower() method.
Since "Pinneaple" is not in lowercase, the else block is executed, and the string name is converted to lowercase using the lower() method.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "Pinneaple" is "pinneaple".
<<<Output>>>
'pinneaple'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(x):
    if x > 0:
        return x
    else:
        return -x
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f(-1)```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The function f takes an integer x as input and returns the absolute value of x.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input -1, we need to analyze the code step by step.
First, the function checks if x is greater than 0 using the if statement.
Since -1 is not greater than 0, the else block is executed, and the function returns the absolute value of x using the -x expression.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input -1 is 1.
<<<Output>>>

The function f takes an integer x as input and returns the absolute value of x.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 1, we need to analyze the code step by step.
First, the function checks if x is greater than 0 using the if statement.
Since 1 is greater than 0, the if block is executed, and the function returns x.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 1 is 1.
