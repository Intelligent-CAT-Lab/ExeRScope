The function f takes a string text as input and returns a modified version of text.
The function first splits the text into individual words using the split() method.
Then, for each word in the text, the function replaces any occurrences of '-word' or 'word-' with a space using the replace() method.
Finally, the function removes any leading or trailing dashes from the resulting text using the strip() method.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input '-stew---corn-and-beans-in soup-.-', we need to split the text into individual words, replace any occurrences of '-stew', '-corn', '-and', '-beans', '-in', '-soup', or '-.', and remove any leading or trailing dashes from the resulting text.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input '-stew---corn-and-beans-in soup-.-' is 'stew corn and beans in soup'.
<<<Output>>>
'stew corn and beans in soup'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(x):
    if x > 0:
        return x
    else:
        return -x
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f(-1)```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The function f takes an integer x as input and returns the absolute value of x.
If x is greater than 0, the function returns x.
Otherwise, if x is less than or equal to 0, the function returns -x.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input -1, we need to check if -1 is greater than 0 or not.
Since -1 is less than 0, the function returns -(-1), which is 1.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input -1 is 1.
<<<Output>>>

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 1, we need to check if 1 is greater than 0 or not.
Since 1 is greater than 0, the function returns 1.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 1 is 1.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 0, we need to check if 0 is greater than 0 or not.
Since 0 is not greater than 0, the function returns -0, which is 0.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 0 is 0.
<<<Output>>>
