The function f takes a string s as input and returns a string based on the following conditions:
1. If the string s consists of only alphabetic characters, the function returns the string "yes".
2. If the string s is an empty string, the function returns the string "str is empty".
3. In all other cases, the function returns the string "no".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "Boolean", we need to analyze the conditions one by one.
1. The string "Boolean" consists of only alphabetic characters, so the function returns the string "yes".
<<<Output>>>
'yes'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    if s.isalpha():
        return "yes"
    if s == "":
        return "str is empty"
    return "no"
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f('123')```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
