The function f takes an array as input and returns a sorted array of positive integers.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [4, 8, 17, 89, 43, 14], we need to perform the following steps:
1. Create an empty array array_2.
2. Iterate through each element i in the input array.
3. If i is greater than 0, append i to array_2.
4. Sort array_2 in descending order.
5. Return array_2.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [4, 8, 17, 89, 43, 14] is [89, 43, 17, 8, 4].
<<<Output>>>
[89, 43, 17, 8, 4]
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(array):
    array_2 = []
    for i in array:
        if i>0:
            array_2 += [i]
    array_2.sort(reverse=True)
    return array_2
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f([4, 8, 17, 89, 43, 14])```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
