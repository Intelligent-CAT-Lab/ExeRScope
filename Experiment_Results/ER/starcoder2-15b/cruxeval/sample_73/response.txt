The function f takes a string row as input and returns a tuple containing the number of occurrences of '1' and '0' in row.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "100010010", we need to count the number of occurrences of '1' and '0' in the string "100010010".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "100010010" is (5, 5).
<<<Output>>>
(5, 5)

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s[0] + s[-1]
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f("hello")```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of the first and last characters of s.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hello", we need to concatenate the first and last characters of the string "hello".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hello" is "ho".
<<<Output>>>
'ho'
