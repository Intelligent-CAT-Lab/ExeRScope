The function f takes an array and an element as input and returns the product of the index of the element in the array and 2 plus the product of the element at the index -ind - 1 in the array and 3.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [-1, 2, 1, -8, 2] and 2, we need to find the index of 2 in the array [-1, 2, 1, -8, 2].
The index of 2 in the array [-1, 2, 1, -8, 2] is 1.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [-1, 2, 1, -8, 2] and 2 is 2 * 2 + -1 * 3 = 1.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(array, elem):
    ind = array.index(elem)
    return ind * 2 + array[-ind - 1] * 3
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f([-1, 2, 1, -8, 2], 2)```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
