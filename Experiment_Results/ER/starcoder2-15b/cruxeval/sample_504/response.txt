The function f takes a list values as input and sorts the list in-place.
It then returns the sorted list.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 1, 1, 1], we need to sort the list in-place and return the sorted list.
Since the list [1, 1, 1, 1] is already sorted, the function f will return the same list without any changes.
<<<Output>>>
[1, 1, 1, 1]
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(values):
    values.sort()
    return values
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f([1, 2, 3, 4])```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
