The function f takes a list of numbers nums as input and returns a list of tuples.
The tuples in the output list are sorted in descending order based on the count of each number in the input list.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1], we need to count the occurrences of each number in the input list and sort the tuples in descending order based on the count.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1] is [(3, 1), (2, 3)].
<<<Output>>>
[(3, 1), (2, 3)]
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(nums):
    output = []
    for n in nums:
        output.append((nums.count(n), n))
    output.sort(reverse=True)
    return output
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f([1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1])```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
