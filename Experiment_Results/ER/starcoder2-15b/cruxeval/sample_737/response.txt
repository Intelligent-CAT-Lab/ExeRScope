The function f takes a list of numbers nums as input and returns the number of decimal numbers in nums.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [0, 6, 2, -1, -2], we need to count the number of decimal numbers in the list [0, 6, 2, -1, -2].
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [0, 6, 2, -1, -2] is 3.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f("hi")```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
