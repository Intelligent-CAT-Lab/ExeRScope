The function f takes two arguments: a string s and an integer l.
It returns the left-justified version of s with a minimum width of l and padded with the character '=' on the right.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'urecord' and 8, we need to left-justify 'urecord' with a minimum width of 8 and padded with the character '=' on the right.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'urecord' and 8 is 'urecord='.
<<<Output>>>
'urecord='

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s.replace('a', 'b')

<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f('aardvark')```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The function f takes a string s as input and returns a new string with all occurrences of the character 'a' replaced with the character 'b'.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'aardvark', we need to replace all occurrences of the character 'a' with the character 'b' in the string 'aardvark'.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'aardvark' is 'bbrdbvbk'.
<<<Output>>>
'bbrdbvbk'
