The function f takes an array arr as input and returns the reversed array.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [2, 0, 1, 9999, 3, -5], we need to reverse the array [2, 0, 1, 9999, 3, -5].
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [2, 0, 1, 9999, 3, -5] is [5, -3, 9999, 1, 0, 2].
<<<Output>>>
[5, -3, 9999, 1, 0, 2]
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(arr):
    return list(reversed(arr))
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f([2, 0, 1, 9999, 3, -5])```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
