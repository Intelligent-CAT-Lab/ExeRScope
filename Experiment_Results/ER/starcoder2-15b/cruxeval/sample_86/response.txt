The function f takes three arguments: instagram, imgur, and wins.
The function creates a list called photos by concatenating instagram and imgur.
The function then checks if instagram is equal to imgur.
If instagram is equal to imgur, the function returns wins.
If wins is not equal to 1, the function reverses the order of the elements in photos and then removes the last element from photos and returns it.
If wins is equal to 1, the function removes the last element from photos and returns it.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(a, b, c):
    if a == b:
        return c
    if a == c:
        return b
    if b == c:
        return a
    return a + b + c
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f(1, 2, 3)```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
