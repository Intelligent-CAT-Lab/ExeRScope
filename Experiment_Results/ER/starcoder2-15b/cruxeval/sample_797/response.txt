The function f takes a dictionary dct as input and returns a list of tuples.
The list is constructed by iterating over the keys of the dictionary in sorted order and appending each key-value pair as a tuple to the list.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}, we need to iterate over the keys of the dictionary in sorted order and append each key-value pair as a tuple to the list.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3} is [('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3)].
<<<Output>>>
[('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3)]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(lst):
    return [x for x in lst if x % 2 == 0]
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list lst as input and returns a new list containing only the even numbers from lst.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], we need to iterate over the elements of lst and append each even number to the new list.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] is [2, 4].
<<<Output>>>
[2, 4]
