The function f takes a string text as input and returns the result of removing all leading digits from text.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "25000   $", we need to remove all leading digits from "25000   $".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "25000   $" is "   $".
<<<Output>>>
'   $'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s[1:] + s[0]
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f("hello")```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of the substring of s starting from index 1 with the first character of s.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hello", we need to concatenate the substring of "hello" starting from index 1 with the first character of "hello".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hello" is "elloh".
<<<Output>>>
'elloh'
