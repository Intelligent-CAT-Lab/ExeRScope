The function f takes a string text as input and returns True if the uppercase version of text is equal to the string representation of text, and False otherwise.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'VTBAEPJSLGAHINS', we need to compare the uppercase version of 'VTBAEPJSLGAHINS' with the string representation of 'VTBAEPJSLGAHINS'.
The uppercase version of 'VTBAEPJSLGAHINS' is 'VTBAEPJSLGAHINS', and the string representation of 'VTBAEPJSLGAHINS' is also 'VTBAEPJSLGAHINS'.
Since the uppercase version of 'VTBAEPJSLGAHINS' is equal to the string representation of 'VTBAEPJSLGAHINS', the function f returns True.

<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f(1)```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes an integer x as input and returns the value of x + 1.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 1, we need to add 1 to the input 1.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 1 is 2.
