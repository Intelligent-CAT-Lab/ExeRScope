The function f takes a string text as input and returns a string that is the same as text but with the case of each character swapped.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "akA?riu", we need to swap the case of each character in the string "akA?riu".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "akA?riu" is "AKa?RIU".
<<<Output>>>
'AKa?RIU'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f("hi")```?First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
