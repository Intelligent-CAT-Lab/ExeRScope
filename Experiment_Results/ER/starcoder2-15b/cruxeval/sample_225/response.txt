The function f takes a string text as input and returns True if the string text is in lowercase, and False otherwise.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "54882", we need to check if the string "54882" is in lowercase.
Since the string "54882" consists of digits, it is not in lowercase.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "54882" is False.
<<<Output>>>
False

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(x):
    if x > 0:
        return x
    else:
        return -x
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f(-5)```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes an integer x as input and returns the absolute value of x.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input -5, we need to check if -5 is greater than 0.
Since -5 is less than 0, the else branch is executed, and the function returns -(-5), which is 5.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input -5 is 5.
<<<Output>>>
5

The function f takes an integer x as input and returns the absolute value of x.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 5, we need to check if 5 is greater than 0.
Since 5 is greater than 0, the if branch is executed, and the function returns 5.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 5 is 5.

The function f takes an integer x as input and returns the absolute value of x.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 0, we need to check if 0 is greater than 0.
Since 0 is not greater than 0, the else branch is executed, and the function returns -0, which is 0.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 0 is 0.
<<<Output>>>
