The function f takes a list xs as input and returns the modified list xs.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [4, 8, 8, 5], we need to analyze the code step by step.
The for loop in the function f iterates over the range of indices from -1 to -len(xs)-1 in decreasing order.
Inside the for loop, the list xs is extended by appending the element xs[i] twice.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [4, 8, 8, 5] is [4, 8, 8, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5].
<<<Output>>>
[4, 8, 8, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(xs):
    for i in range(len(xs)):
        xs[i] = xs[i] * 2
    return xs
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f([4, 8, 8, 5])```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The for loop in the function f iterates over the range of indices from 0 to len(xs)-1.
Inside the for loop, the element xs[i] is multiplied by 2 and assigned back to xs[i].
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [4, 8, 8, 5] is [8, 16, 16, 10].
