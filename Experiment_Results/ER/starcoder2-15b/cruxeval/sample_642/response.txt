The function f takes a string text as input and returns either the string "space" or the string "no".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "     ", we need to analyze the code step by step.
First, the variable i is initialized to 0.
Then, a while loop is executed, which continues as long as i is less than the length of text and the character at index i in text is a whitespace character.
In the while loop, the variable i is incremented by 1.
Since the input string "     " only contains whitespace characters, the while loop will continue until i reaches the length of the string, which is 5.
After the while loop, an if statement is executed, which checks if i is equal to the length of text.
Since i is equal to the length of text, the if statement is executed and the function returns the string "space".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "     " is "space".
<<<Output>>>
'space'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    if len(s) == 0:
        return 0
    return f(s[1:]) + 1
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f("hello")```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The function f takes a string s as input and returns the length of s.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hello", we need to analyze the code step by step.
First, an if statement is executed, which checks if the length of s is equal to 0.
Since the length of s is not equal to 0, the if statement is not executed and the function proceeds to the next line.
The function f is called recursively with the input s[1:], which is the string "ello".
The function f is called again with the input s[1:], which is the string "llo".
The function f is called again with the input s[1:], which is the string "lo".
The function f is called again with the input s[1:], which is the string "o".
The function f is called again with the input s[1:], which is the empty string "".
The function f is called again with the input s[1:], which is the empty string "".
Since the length of the empty string is 0, the if statement is executed and the function returns 0.
The function f is called again with the input s[1:], which is the string "o".
The function f is called again with the input s[1:], which is the string "lo".
The function f is called again with the input s[1:], which is the string "llo".
The function f is called again with the input s[1:], which is the string "ello".
The function f is called again with the input s[1:], which is the string "hello".
Since the length of s is not equal to 0, the if statement is not executed and the function proceeds to the next line.
The function returns the result of f(s[1:]) + 1, which is 0 + 1.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hello" is 5.
<<<Output>>>
5
