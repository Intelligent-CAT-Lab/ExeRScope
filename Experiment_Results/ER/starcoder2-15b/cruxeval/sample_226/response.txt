The function f takes a list of integers nums as input and returns the modified list nums.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 3], we need to analyze the code step by step.
The code iterates over the elements of nums using a for loop.
For each element, if the element is divisible by 3, the element is appended to the end of the list nums.
After the for loop, the modified list nums is returned.
<<<Output>>>
[1, 3, 3]
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(nums):
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        if nums[i] % 3 == 0:
            nums.append(nums[i])
    return nums
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f([1, 3])```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
