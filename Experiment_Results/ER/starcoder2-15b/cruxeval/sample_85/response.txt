The function f takes an integer n as input and returns a sorted list of values.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 12, we need to analyze the code step by step.
First, the function initializes a dictionary values with keys 0, 1, and 2 and corresponding values 3, 4.5, and '-', respectively.
Then, it initializes an empty dictionary res.
Next, the function iterates over the items in values using a for loop.
For each item, it checks if the key i is not equal to 2.
If this condition is true, it adds a new key-value pair to res where the key is the value j and the value is n // 2.
Finally, the function returns the sorted list of values in res.
<<<Output>>>
[3, 4.5]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(n):
    values = {0: 3, 1: 4.5, 2: '-'}
    res = {}
    for i, j in values.items():
        if i % n != 2:
            res[j] = n // 2
    return sorted(res)
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f(12)```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
