The function f takes a list and a function as input and returns the list after applying the function to it.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [6, 4, 2, 8, 15] and (lambda x: x.reverse()), we need to apply the function (lambda x: x.reverse()) to the list [6, 4, 2, 8, 15].
The function (lambda x: x.reverse()) takes a list x as input and reverses it.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [6, 4, 2, 8, 15] and (lambda x: x.reverse()) is [15, 8, 2, 4, 6].
<<<Output>>>
[6, 4, 2, 8, 15]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(list, operation):
    new_list = list[:]
    new_list.sort()
    operation(new_list)
    return list
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f([6, 4, 2, 8, 15], (lambda x: x.reverse()))```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
