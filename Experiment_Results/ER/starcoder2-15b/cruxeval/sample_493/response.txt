The function f takes a dictionary d as input and returns a list of strings.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input {'-4':'4','1':'2','-':'-3'}, we need to analyze the code step by step.
First, we initialize a list keys to store the strings.
Then, we iterate over the keys of the dictionary d using a for loop.
For each key k, we append a string to keys that consists of the key k and the corresponding value d[k] separated by the string " => ".
Finally, we return the list keys.
<<<Output>>>
['-4 => 4', '1 => 2', '- => -3']

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f("hi")```?First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
