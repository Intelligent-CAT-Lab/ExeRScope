The function f takes a list lst as input and modifies the list in-place by reversing the elements from index 1 to index 3 (inclusive) of the list.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 2, 3], we need to reverse the elements from index 1 to index 3 (inclusive) of the list [1, 2, 3].
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 2, 3] is [1, 3, 2].
<<<Output>>>
[1, 3, 2]
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(lst):
    lst[1:4] = lst[1:4][::-1]
    return lst
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f([1, 2, 3])```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
