The function f takes a string text as input and returns a list of strings.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "123", we need to analyze the code step by step.
First, we initialize an empty list text_arr.
Then, we iterate over the range of the length of the input text.
For each iteration, we append the substring of text starting from the current index j to the end of the string to text_arr.
Finally, we return text_arr.
<<<Output>>>
['123', '23', '3']

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f("hi")```?First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:

def f(text):

    for j in range(len(text)):
        text_arr.append(text[j:])
    return text_arr
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f('123')```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
