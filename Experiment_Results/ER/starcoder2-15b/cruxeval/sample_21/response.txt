The function f takes an array as input and returns the modified array.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 1, 2, 2], we need to analyze the code step by step.
First, the function f takes the input array and removes the last element using the pop() method.
The pop() method removes the last element from the array and returns it.
In this case, the last element of the input array is 2, so the pop() method returns 2.
The function then extends the array with the returned element using the extend() method.
The extend() method appends the elements of the iterable to the end of the array.
In this case, the iterable is [2, 2], so the array is extended with 2 and 2.
Finally, the function returns the modified array.
<<<Output>>>
[1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f("hi")```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
