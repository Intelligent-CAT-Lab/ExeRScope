The function f takes a string s as input and returns the sum of the number of words in s that are title cased.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "SOME OF THIS Is uknowN!", we need to split the input string into words and check if each word is title cased.
We can use the string method istitle() to check if a word is title cased.
The function sum() takes a list of boolean values and returns the sum of the number of True values in the list.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "SOME OF THIS Is uknowN!" is 3.
<<<Output>>>
3

What would be the return value of ```f('SOME OF THIS Is uknowN!')```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The function f takes a string s as input and returns the first word in s.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "SOME OF THIS Is uknowN!", we need to split the input string into words and return the first word.
We can use the string method split() to split the input string into a list of words.
The function f then returns the first element of the list, which is the first word in the input string.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "SOME OF THIS Is uknowN!" is "SOME".
<<<Output>>>
'SOME'
