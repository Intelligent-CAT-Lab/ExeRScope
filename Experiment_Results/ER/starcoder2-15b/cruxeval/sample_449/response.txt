The function f takes a string x as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the string x consists entirely of digits.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input '1', we need to analyze the code step by step.
First, the function initializes two variables n and i. n is assigned the length of the input string x, which is 1. i is initialized to 0.
Next, the function enters a while loop. The loop condition is i < n and x[i].isdigit().
In the first iteration of the loop, i is 0 and n is 1. x[i] is the first character of the string x, which is '1'.
Since '1' is a digit, x[i].isdigit() returns True. Therefore, the loop condition is True, and the loop body is executed.
In the loop body, i is incremented by 1, so i becomes 1.
Since i is now equal to n, the loop condition is False, and the loop exits.
Finally, the function returns the value of i == n, which is False since i is 1 and n is 1.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input '1' is False.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(x):
    n = len(x)
    i = 0
    while i < n and x[i].isdigit():
        i += 1
    return i == n

What would be the return value of ```f('123')```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The function f takes a string x as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the string x consists entirely of digits.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input '123', we need to analyze the code step by step.
First, the function initializes two variables n and i. n is assigned the length of the input string x, which is 3. i is initialized to 0.
Next, the function enters a while loop. The loop condition is i < n and x[i].isdigit().
In the first iteration of the loop, i is 0 and n is 3. x[i] is the first character of the string x, which is '1'.
Since '1' is a digit, x[i].isdigit() returns True. Therefore, the loop condition is True, and the loop body is executed.
In the loop body, i is incremented by 1, so i becomes 1.
In the second iteration of the loop, i is 1 and n is 3. x[i] is the second character of the string x, which is '2'.
Since '2' is a digit, x[i].isdigit() returns True. Therefore, the loop condition is True, and the loop body is executed.
In the loop body, i is incremented by 1, so i becomes 2.
In the third iteration of the loop, i is 2 and n is 3. x[i] is the third character of the string x, which is '3'.
Since '3' is a digit, x[i].isdigit() returns True. Therefore, the loop condition is True, and the loop body is executed.
In the loop body, i is incremented by 1, so i becomes 3.
Since i is now equal to n, the loop condition is False, and the loop exits.
Finally, the function returns the value of i == n, which is True since i is 3 and n is 3.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input '123' is True.
