The function f takes two arguments: text and strip_chars.
It returns the reversed version of text with the characters in strip_chars removed from both ends.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input ('tcmfsmj', 'cfj'), we need to reverse the string 'tcmfsmj' and remove the characters 'cfj' from both ends.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input ('tcmfsmj', 'cfj') is 'msftcm'.
<<<Output>>>
'msftcm'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s[::-1]
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f("hello")```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The function f takes a string s as input and returns the reversed version of s.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hello", we need to reverse the string "hello".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hello" is "olleh".
<<<Output>>>
'olleh'
