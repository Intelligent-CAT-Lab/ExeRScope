The function f takes an array arr as input and returns a new array sub.
The new array sub is initialized to a copy of the input array arr.
Then, a for loop is executed, which iterates over the indices of the array sub.
For each index i, the value at index i in the array sub is multiplied by 5.
The function returns the modified array sub.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [-3, -6, 2, 7], we need to perform the steps described above.
The new array sub is initialized to a copy of the input array [-3, -6, 2, 7].
Then, the for loop is executed, which iterates over the indices of the array sub.
For the first iteration, the value at index 0 in the array sub is multiplied by 5.
The value at index 0 in the array sub is -3, so the value at index 0 in the array sub becomes -15.
For the second iteration, the value at index 1 in the array sub is multiplied by 5.
The value at index 1 in the array sub is -6, so the value at index 1 in the array sub becomes -30.
For the third iteration, the value at index 2 in the array sub is multiplied by 5.
The value at index 2 in the array sub is 2, so the value at index 2 in the array sub becomes 10.
For the fourth iteration, the value at index 3 in the array sub is multiplied by 5.
The value at index 3 in the array sub is 7, so the value at index 3 in the array sub becomes 35.
The function returns the modified array sub, which is [-15, -30, 10, 35].
<<<Output>>>
[-15, -30, 10, 35]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(arr):
    count = len(arr)
    sub = arr.copy()
    for i in range(0, count, 2):
        sub[i] *= 5
    return sub
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f([-3, -6, 2, 7])```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
