The function f takes a string st as input and returns either the string "Hey" or the string "Hi".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "Hi there", we need to analyze the code step by step.
First, the function checks if the index of the character 'h' in the lowercase version of st is greater than or equal to the index of the character 'i' in the lowercase version of st.
Since the index of the character 'h' in the lowercase version of "Hi there" is 2 and the index of the character 'i' in the lowercase version of "Hi there" is 1, the condition is satisfied.
Therefore, the function returns the string "Hey".
<<<Output>>>
'Hey'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s[0] + s[1] + s[2]
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f('hello')```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of the first three characters of s.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hello", we need to concatenate the first three characters of "hello".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hello" is "hel".
<<<Output>>>
'hel'
