The function f takes three arguments: text, suffix, and num.
It returns True if the text ends with the suffix concatenated with the string representation of num, and False otherwise.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input ('friends and love', 'and', 3), we need to check if the text 'friends and love' ends with the suffix 'and' concatenated with the string representation of the number 3.
Since the text does not end with the suffix concatenated with the string representation of the number 3, the function returns False.
<<<Output>>>
False

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f("hi")```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
