The function f takes a list nums as input and returns the sum of the even numbers in nums.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [11, 21, 0, 11], we need to find the sum of the even numbers in the list [11, 21, 0, 11].
The for loop iterates over the elements of nums and removes the odd numbers from the list.
The second for loop iterates over the remaining elements of nums and adds them to the sum.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [11, 21, 0, 11] is 0.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(nums):
    for odd in nums[:]:
        if odd % 2 != 0:
            nums.remove(odd)
    sum_ = 0
    for num in nums:
        sum_ += num
    return sum_
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f([11, 21, 0, 11])```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
