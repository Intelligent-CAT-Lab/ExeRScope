The function f takes a list lst as input and returns a new list.
The function f creates a new list new and initializes a variable i to the length of lst minus 1.
The function f then iterates over the range of the length of lst using a for loop.
Inside the for loop, the function f checks if i is even using the modulo operator.
If i is even, the function f appends the negative of lst[i] to new.
Otherwise, the function f appends lst[i] to new.
Finally, the function f decrements i by 1 and returns new.
<<<Output>>>
[-1, -7, 1, 3]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(lst):
    new = list()
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        if i%2 == 0:
            new.append(-lst[i])
        else:
            new.append(lst[i])
    return new
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f([1, 7, -1, -3])```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
