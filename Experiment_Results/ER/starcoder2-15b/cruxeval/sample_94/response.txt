The function f takes two dictionaries a and b as input and returns a new dictionary that contains the key-value pairs from both a and b.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input {'w': 5, 'wi': 10} and {'w': 3}, we need to merge the two dictionaries.
Since the key 'w' is present in both dictionaries, the value from the second dictionary {'w': 3} will be used.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input {'w': 5, 'wi': 10} and {'w': 3} is {'w': 3, 'wi': 10}.
<<<Output>>>
{'w': 3, 'wi': 10}

<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f(1, 2)```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The function f takes two numbers a and b as input and returns the sum of a and b.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 1 and 2, we need to add 1 and 2.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 1 and 2 is 3.
