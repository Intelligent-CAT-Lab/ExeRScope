The function f takes a list nums as input and returns the modified list nums.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 2, 4], we need to analyze the code step by step.
The code first iterates over the range of the length of the input list nums.
For each iteration, the code inserts the square of the current element at the current index in the list.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 2, 4] is [1, 1, 4, 4, 16].
<<<Output>>>
[1, 1, 4, 4, 16]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(nums):
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        nums[i] = nums[i]**2
    return nums
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f([1, 2, 4])```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
