The function f takes two arguments: text and to_remove.
It creates a new list new_text by converting the input text to a list.
It then checks if the character to_remove is present in new_text.
If it is, it finds the index of to_remove in new_text and removes it from new_text.
It then inserts a question mark ('?') at the index of to_remove in new_text and removes the question mark.
Finally, it returns the joined string of the elements in new_text.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f("hi")```?First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
