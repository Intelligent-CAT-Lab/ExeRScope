The function f takes a string text as input and returns a new string with the case of each character in text swapped.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "dst vavf n dmv dfvm gamcu dgcvb.", we need to swap the case of each character in the string.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "dst vavf n dmv dfvm gamcu dgcvb." is "DST VAVF N DMV DFVM GAMCU DGCVB.".
<<<Output>>>
'DST VAVF N DMV DFVM GAMCU DGCVB.'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(x):
    return x + 1
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f(1)```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes an integer x as input and returns the value of x + 1.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 1, we need to add 1 to the input.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 1 is 2.
