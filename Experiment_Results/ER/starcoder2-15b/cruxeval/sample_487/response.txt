The function f takes a dictionary dict as input and returns a list of keys from dict that are even numbers.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input { 4: 'a' }, we need to iterate through the keys of the dictionary and check if each key is an even number.
If a key is an even number, we append it to the list even_keys.
In this case, the only key in the dictionary is 4, which is an even number.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input { 4: 'a' } is [4].
<<<Output>>>
[4]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f("hi")```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
