The function f takes three arguments: n, m, and text.
The function checks if the text argument is empty or not.
If the text argument is empty, the function returns the text argument.
If the text argument is not empty, the function splits the text argument into three parts: head, mid, and tail.
The head is the first character of the text argument, the mid is the middle part of the text argument excluding the first and last characters, and the tail is the last character of the text argument.
The function then replaces all occurrences of n in head, mid, and tail with m and joins them together.
The function returns the joined string.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(n, m, text):
    if text.strip() == '':
        return text
    head, mid, tail = text[0], text[1:-1], text[-1]
    joined = head.replace(n, m) + mid.replace(n, m) + tail.replace(n, m)
    return joined
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```f("x", "$", "2xz&5H3*1a@#a*1hris")```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
