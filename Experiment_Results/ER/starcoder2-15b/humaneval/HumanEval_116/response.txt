The code defines a function sort_array that takes an array of integers as input.
It first sorts the array using the built-in sorted function.
Then, it sorts the array again, but this time using a custom key function that counts the number of ones in the binary representation of each element.
The key function is defined using a lambda expression, which takes an element x as input and returns the number of ones in its binary representation.
The binary representation is obtained using the bin function, which returns a string starting with '0b'. The count method is then used to count the number of ones in the string.
The sorted function is called twice, with the second call using the custom key function.
The first call sorts the array in ascending order, while the second call sorts the array based on the number of ones in the binary representation of each element.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def find_max_sum(arr):
    max_sum = 0
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        for j in range(i+1, len(arr)):
            if arr[i] + arr[j] > max_sum:
                max_sum = arr[i] + arr[j]
    return max_sum
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```find_max_sum([1,2,3,4,5])```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The code defines a function find_max_sum that takes an array of integers as input.
It initializes a variable max_sum to 0, which will be used to store the maximum sum of two elements in the array.
The code then enters a nested loop that iterates over all pairs of elements in the array.
For each pair of elements, the code checks if their sum is greater than max_sum. If it is, it updates max_sum to be the sum of the current pair of elements.
After the nested loop finishes, the code returns the value of max_sum, which is the maximum sum of two elements in the array.
