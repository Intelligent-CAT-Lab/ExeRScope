The function remove_vowels takes a string text as input and returns a new string with all vowels removed.
The code first imports the typing module, which is not necessary for this function.
The function then defines a list comprehension that iterates over each character s in text.
For each character, it checks if its lowercase version is not in the list of vowels ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"]. If it is not, it adds the character to a new list.
Finally, the function joins all the characters in the new list and returns the resulting string.
In this case, the input text is "fedcba". The function iterates over each character and checks if it is a vowel. Since "e" is a vowel, it is not added to the new list. The same happens for "a" and "o". The remaining characters "f", "d", "c" and "b" are added to the new list.
The function then joins all the characters in the new list and returns the resulting string, which is "fdb".

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>

What would be the return value of ```sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)```?First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

84
