The variable n is initialized to 5.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 2 to n-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 2 to 4.
For each number i in this range, it checks if it is a prime number by dividing it by all numbers from 2 to i-1. If it is not divisible by any of them, it is a prime number and is added to the list primes.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of primes, which is [2, 3].
<<<Output>>>
[2, 3]

        if A <= sum_order <= B:

The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
