The function match_parens takes a list of strings as input and returns a string.
The function first defines a helper function check that takes a string as input and returns a boolean value.
The helper function check iterates through each character in the string and keeps track of the balance of parentheses using the variable val.
If the character is an opening parenthesis '(', the balance is increased by 1. If it is a closing parenthesis ')', the balance is decreased by 1.
The function then checks if the balance is negative at any point, indicating an unbalanced string. If it is, the function returns False.
Otherwise, it returns True if the balance is 0, indicating a balanced string.
The function then concatenates the first two elements of the input list into a string S1 and the second and first elements into a string S2.
It then calls the helper function check on both S1 and S2 and returns 'Yes' if either of them returns True, or 'No' if both return False.
In this case, the input list is ['()(', ')'].
The function concatenates the first two elements of the list into S1, which is '()(' + ')'.
The function concatenates the second and first elements of the list into S2, which is ')' + '()('.
The function then calls the helper function check on S1 and S2 and returns 'Yes' if either of them returns True, or 'No' if both return False.
The helper function check is called on S1, which is '()(' + ')'.
The function iterates through each character in the string and keeps track of the balance of parentheses using the variable val.
The first character is '(', so the balance is increased by 1.
The second character is '(', so the balance is increased by 1.
The third character is ')', so the balance is decreased by 1.
The fourth character is '(', so the balance is increased by 1.
The fifth character is ')', so the balance is decreased by 1.
The balance is now 0, so the function returns True.
The helper function check is called on S2, which is ')' + '()('.
The function iterates through each character in the string and keeps track of the balance of parentheses using the variable val.
The first character is ')', so the balance is decreased by 1.
The second character is '(', so the balance is increased by 1.
The third character is '(', so the balance is increased by 1.
The fourth character is ')', so the balance is decreased by 1.
The balance is now 0, so the function returns True.
Since either of the calls to the helper function check returned True, the function returns 'Yes'.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def find_max_sum(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    max_sum = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i, n):
            sum_subarray = 0
            for k in range(i, j+1):
                sum_subarray += arr[k]
            max_sum = max(max_sum, sum_subarray)
    return max_sum
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```find_max_sum([1, 2, 3, -2, 5])```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function find_max_sum takes an array of integers as input and returns an integer.
The function first calculates the length of the array using the len function and stores it in the variable n.
The function then initializes the variable max_sum to 0, which will be used to store the maximum sum of a subarray.
The function then enters a nested loop that iterates over all possible subarrays of the array.
The outer loop iterates over the start index of the subarray, i, from 0 to n-1.
The inner loop iterates over the end index of the subarray, j, from i to n-1.
For each subarray, the function calculates the sum of the elements in the subarray by iterating over the elements from i to j and adding them to the variable sum_subarray.
The function then updates max_sum to the maximum of max_sum and sum_subarray.
The function then returns max_sum, which is the maximum sum of a subarray in the array.
In this case, the input array is [1, 2,
