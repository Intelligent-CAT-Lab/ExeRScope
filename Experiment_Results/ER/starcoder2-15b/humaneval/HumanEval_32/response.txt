The function poly takes a list of coefficients xs and a float x as input and returns the value of the polynomial with those coefficients evaluated at x.
The function find_zero takes a list of coefficients xs as input and returns the root of the polynomial with those coefficients.
The function find_zero uses a binary search algorithm to find the root of the polynomial.
The function starts by setting the initial search range to [-1, 1].
It then checks if the polynomial evaluated at the endpoints of the search range has the same sign.
If they do, it doubles the search range and repeats the check.
This is done until the search range is sufficiently small, which is when the difference between the endpoints is less than 1e-10.
The function then performs a binary search within the search range to find the root of the polynomial.
It does this by repeatedly dividing the search range in half and checking if the polynomial evaluated at the center of the search range has the same sign as the polynomial evaluated at one of the endpoints.
If it does, it sets the other endpoint of the search range to the center.
If not, it sets the center to the other endpoint.
This process is repeated until the search range is sufficiently small, at which point the function returns the center of the search range as the root of the polynomial.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def find_max(nums):
    max_num = nums[0]
    for num in nums:
        if num > max_num:
            max_num = num
    return max_num

def find_min(nums):
    min_num = nums[0]
    for num in nums:
        if num < min_num:
            min_num = num
    return min_num

def find_range(nums):
    return find_max(nums) - find_min(nums)
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```find_range([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function find_max takes a list of numbers nums as input and returns the maximum value in the list.
The function find_min takes a list of numbers nums as input and returns the minimum value in the list.
The function find_range takes a list of numbers nums as input and returns the range of the list, which is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list.
The function find_range calls the functions find_max and find_min to find the maximum and minimum values in the list, respectively.
It then returns the difference between these two values as the range of the list.
