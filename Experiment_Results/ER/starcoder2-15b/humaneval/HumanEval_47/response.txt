The function median takes a list of numbers as input and returns the median of the list.
The code first sorts the list l using the sorted function.
It then checks if the length of the list is odd or even. If it is odd, it returns the middle element of the list. If it is even, it returns the average of the two middle elements.
In the example, the list is sorted to [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. Since the length of the list is odd, the middle element is 3, so the median is 3.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
