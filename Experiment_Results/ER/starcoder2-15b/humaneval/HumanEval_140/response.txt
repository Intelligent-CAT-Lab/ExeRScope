The variable text is initialized to "Example".
The variable new_text is initialized to an empty string, which will be used to store the modified text.
The variable i is initialized to 0, which will be used as the index to iterate through the text.
The variable start and end are initialized to 0, which will be used to track the start and end indices of consecutive spaces.
The code enters a while loop that iterates while i is less than the length of text.
Inside the loop, if the current character text[i] is a space, the end index is incremented by 1.
If the current character is not a space, the code checks if the difference between end and start is greater than 2. If it is, the code adds a hyphen and the current character to new_text.
If the difference is greater than 0 but less than or equal to 2, the code adds underscores equal to the difference between end and start followed by the current character to new_text.
If the difference is 0, the code adds the current character to new_text.
The start and end indices are updated to the current index i + 1.
After the loop finishes, if the difference between end and start is greater than 2, the code adds a hyphen to new_text.
If the difference is greater than 0 but less than or equal to 2, the code adds underscores equal to the difference between end and start to new_text.
The code returns the modified text new_text.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def find_max_sum(nums):
    max_sum = 0
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        for j in range(i+1, len(nums)):
            if nums[i] + nums[j] > max_sum:
                max_sum = nums[i] + nums[j]
    return max_sum
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```find_max_sum([1, 2, 3, 4])```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable nums is initialized to [1, 2, 3, 4].
The variable max_sum is initialized to 0, which will be used to store the maximum sum of two numbers in nums.
The code enters a nested loop that iterates over the indices of nums.
For each index i, the code iterates over the indices j from i + 1 to the end of nums.
Inside the inner loop, if the sum of nums[i] and nums[j] is greater than max_sum, the code updates max_sum to the sum of nums[i] and nums[j].
After the nested loop finishes, the code returns the maximum sum max_sum.
