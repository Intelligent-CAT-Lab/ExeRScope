The variable n is initialized to 5.
The code creates a list A using a list comprehension. It generates a list of n numbers, where the ith number is i*i - i + 1.
The code then initializes an empty list ans to store the triples that meet the condition.
The code enters a nested loop that iterates over all possible combinations of three numbers from A.
For each combination, it checks if the sum of the three numbers is divisible by 3. If it is, it adds the triple to ans.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the length of ans, which is the number of triples that meet the condition.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def get_max_sum(n):
    A = [i*i - i + 1 for i in range(1,n+1)]
    ans = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i+1,n):
            for k in range(j+1,n):
                if (A[i]+A[j]+A[k])%3 == 0:
                    ans = max(ans,A[i]+A[j]+A[k])
    return ans

What would be the return value of ```get_max_sum(5)```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The variable n is initialized to 5.
The code creates a list A using a list comprehension. It generates a list of n numbers, where the ith number is i*i - i + 1.
The code then initializes ans to 0, which will be used to store the maximum sum of triples that meet the condition.
The code enters a nested loop that iterates over all possible combinations of three numbers from A.
For each combination, it checks if the sum of the three numbers is divisible by 3. If it is, it updates ans to the maximum of ans and the sum of the three numbers.
After the loop finishes, the code returns ans, which is the maximum sum of triples that meet the condition.
