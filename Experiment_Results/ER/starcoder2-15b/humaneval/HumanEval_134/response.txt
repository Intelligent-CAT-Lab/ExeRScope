The variable txt is initialized to "apple".
The code then splits the string into a list of words using the split() method.
The code then takes the last word from the list using the [-1] index.
The code then checks if the last word is a single letter by checking if its length is 1 and if its ASCII value is between 97 and 122 (inclusive).
The code then returns True if the last word is a single letter, and False otherwise.
In this case, the last word is "e", which is a single letter.
<<<Output>>>
True

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(txt):
 
    check = txt.split(' ')[-1]
    return True if len(check) == 1 and (97 <= ord(check.lower()) <= 122) else False
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple") ```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
