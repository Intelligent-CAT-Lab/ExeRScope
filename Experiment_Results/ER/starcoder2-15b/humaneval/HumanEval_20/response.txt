The function find_closest_elements takes a list of numbers as input and returns a tuple of two numbers that are closest to each other.
The function iterates through the list of numbers using a nested for loop. For each number, it compares it to every other number in the list.
If the distance between the two numbers is smaller than the current smallest distance, the function updates the smallest distance and the closest pair of numbers.
The function returns the closest pair of numbers as a tuple.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def find_max_sum(nums):
    max_sum = 0
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        for j in range(i, len(nums)):
            current_sum = 0
            for k in range(i, j+1):
                current_sum += nums[k]
            max_sum = max(max_sum, current_sum)
    return max_sum
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```find_max_sum([1, 2, 3, -2, 5])```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function find_max_sum takes a list of numbers as input and returns the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray within the list.
The function iterates through the list using two nested for loops. The outer loop iterates from 0 to the length of the list, and the inner loop iterates from i to the end of the list.
For each subarray starting at index i and ending at index j, the function calculates the sum of the elements in the subarray by iterating through the elements from i to j and adding them to current_sum.
The function then updates max_sum to the maximum of max_sum and current_sum.
The function returns max_sum, which is the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray within the list.
