The code takes a string as input and returns a list of strings.
The code iterates through each character in the input string.
If the character is an opening parenthesis '(', the current depth is increased by 1 and the character is added to the current string.
If the character is a closing parenthesis ')', the current depth is decreased by 1 and the character is added to the current string.
If the current depth reaches 0, it means that a complete group of parentheses has been found, so the current string is added to the result list and the current string is cleared.
The code returns the result list, which contains the separate groups of parentheses.
<<<Output>>>
['(()())', '((()))', '()', '((())()())']

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def find_max_sum(nums):
    max_sum = 0
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        for j in range(i, len(nums)):
            current_sum = sum(nums[i:j+1])
            if current_sum > max_sum:
                max_sum = current_sum
    return max_sum
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```find_max_sum([1, 2, 3, -2, 5])```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a list of numbers as input and returns the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray.
The code iterates through the list using two nested loops. The outer loop iterates from 0 to the length of the list, and the inner loop iterates from i to the end of the list.
For each pair of indices i and j, the code calculates the sum of the elements between i and j (inclusive) using the sum() function.
If the current sum is greater than the maximum sum found so far, the maximum sum is updated.
The code returns the maximum sum found.
