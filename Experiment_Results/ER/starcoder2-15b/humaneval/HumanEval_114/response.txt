The code defines a function minSubArraySum that takes a list of integers nums as input.
It initializes two variables: max_sum and s. max_sum is used to store the maximum sum of a subarray, and s is used to store the sum of the current subarray.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each element in nums. For each element num, it adds -num to s and checks if s is less than 0. If it is, it sets s to 0.
It then updates max_sum to be the maximum of s and max_sum.
After the loop, if max_sum is still 0, it sets it to the maximum of -i for i in nums.
Finally, it calculates min_sum as -max_sum and returns it.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def find_max_sum(nums):
    max_sum = 0
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        for j in range(i, len(nums)):
            sub_array = nums[i:j+1]
            sub_sum = sum(sub_array)
            max_sum = max(max_sum, sub_sum)
    return max_sum
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```find_max_sum([2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 4])```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The code defines a function find_max_sum that takes a list of integers nums as input.
It initializes a variable max_sum to store the maximum sum of a subarray.
The code then enters a nested loop that iterates over all possible subarrays of nums. For each subarray, it calculates its sum and updates max_sum if the sum is greater than the current maximum.
After the nested loop, it returns max_sum, which is the maximum sum of a subarray in nums.
