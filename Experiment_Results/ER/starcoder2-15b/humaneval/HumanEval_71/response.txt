The function triangle_area takes three arguments: a, b, and c, which represent the lengths of the three sides of a triangle.
The function first checks if the triangle is valid by checking if the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side. If any of these conditions is not met, the function returns -1.
If the triangle is valid, the function calculates the semi-perimeter s using the formula (a + b + c) / 2.
The function then calculates the area of the triangle using Heron's formula, which is the square root of the product of s, s - a, s - b, and s - c.
The function rounds the area to two decimal places using the round function and returns it.
In this case, the function is called with arguments 3, 4, and 5, which represent the lengths of the sides of a triangle.
Since the triangle is valid (3 + 4 > 5, 3 + 5 > 4, and 4 + 5 > 3), the function calculates the semi-perimeter s to be 6.
The function then calculates the area of the triangle using Heron's formula, which is the square root of the product of s, s - a, s - b, and s - c.
