The code defines a function find_max that takes a list of strings as input and returns the string with the maximum length.
The function uses the sorted function to sort the strings based on their length in descending order.
The key parameter of the sorted function is a lambda function that returns a tuple containing the negative length of the set of characters in the string and the string itself. This ensures that strings with the same length are sorted alphabetically.
The function then returns the first element of the sorted list, which is the string with the maximum length.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def find_max(words):
    return sorted(words, key = lambda x: (-len(set(x)), x))[0]
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```find_max(["name", "of", "string"])```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
