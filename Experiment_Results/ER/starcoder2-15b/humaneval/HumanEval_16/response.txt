The code defines a function count_distinct_characters that takes a string as input and returns the number of distinct characters in the string.
The function first converts the string to lowercase using the lower() method.
Then it creates a set from the string using the set() function. A set is a collection of unique elements, so it will remove any duplicate characters.
Finally, it returns the length of the set using the len() function.
When we call the function with the input 'abcde' + 'cade' + 'CADE', the string is concatenated using the + operator, resulting in 'abcdecadeCADE'.
The function then converts the string to lowercase, resulting in 'abcdecadecade'.
The set() function creates a set from the string, removing any duplicate characters, resulting in {'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'c', 'a', 'd', 'e'}.
The len() function returns the length of the set, which is 9.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def count_distinct_characters(string: str) -> int:
    return len(set(string.lower()))
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```count_distinct_characters('abcde' + 'cade' + 'CADE') ```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
