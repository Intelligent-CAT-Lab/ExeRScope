The function correct_bracketing takes a string brackets as input.
It initializes a variable depth to 0, which will be used to track the depth of the brackets.
The code then iterates through each character b in brackets.
If b is "<", the code increments depth by 1.
If b is ">", the code decrements depth by 1.
The code checks if depth is less than 0 at any point during the iteration. If it is, it returns False, indicating that the brackets are not properly nested.
After the loop finishes, the code checks if depth is equal to 0. If it is, it returns True, indicating that the brackets are properly nested.
In this case, the input is "<<><>>", which has a depth of 0 at the end of the loop. Therefore, the function returns True.
<<<Output>>>
True

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)```?First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
