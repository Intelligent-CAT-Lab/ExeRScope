The variable lst is initialized to an empty list, and the variable x is initialized to 1.
The code then creates a list comprehension that iterates over the rows and columns of lst, and checks if the value at each position is equal to x. If it is, it adds the corresponding coordinates (i, j) to the list.
The list comprehension returns a list of tuples, where each tuple represents the coordinates of a position in lst that contains the value x.
The code then sorts the list of coordinates in descending order based on the second element of each tuple (j), and then sorts the list again based on the first element of each tuple (i).
The sorted function returns a new list with the elements sorted in ascending order.
Since lst is an empty list, the list comprehension will return an empty list, and the sorted function will return an empty list as well.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def get_sum(N):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if sum_order % 2 == 0:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```get_sum(20)```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized to 20.
The variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is even, which means it is divisible by 2. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 110.
