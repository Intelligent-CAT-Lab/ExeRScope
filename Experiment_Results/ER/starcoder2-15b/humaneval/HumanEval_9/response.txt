The function rolling_max takes a list of integers as input and returns a list of integers.
The function initializes two variables: running_max and result. running_max is used to store the running maximum of the input list, and result is a list to store the running maximum for each element in the input list.
The function then iterates through the input list using a for loop. For each element n in the list, the function checks if running_max is None. If it is, it sets running_max to n. Otherwise, it updates running_max to the maximum of running_max and n.
After updating running_max, the function appends running_max to the result list.
Finally, the function returns the result list.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)```?First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
