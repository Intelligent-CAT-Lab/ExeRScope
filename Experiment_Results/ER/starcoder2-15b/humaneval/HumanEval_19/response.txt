The code defines a function sort_numbers that takes a string of numbers as input and returns a string of sorted numbers.
The function first creates a dictionary value_map that maps each number word to its corresponding integer value.
The function then splits the input string numbers by spaces and creates a list of words.
It then filters out any empty strings from the list and sorts the remaining words based on their corresponding integer values in value_map.
Finally, it joins the sorted words back into a string and returns it.
In this case, the input string is 'five zero four seven nine eight'.
The function splits the string by spaces and creates a list of words: ['five', 'zero', 'four', 'seven', 'nine', 'eight'].
It then filters out any empty strings from the list and sorts the remaining words based on their corresponding integer values in value_map: ['zero', 'four', 'eight', 'five', 'nine', 'seven'].
Finally, it joins the sorted words back into a string and returns it: 'zero four eight five nine seven'.
<<<Output>>>
zero four eight five nine seven

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def find_max_sum(nums):
    max_sum = 0
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        for j in range(i, len(nums)):
            current_sum = sum(nums[i:j+1])
            if current_sum > max_sum:
                max_sum = current_sum
    return max_sum
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```find_max_sum([1, 2, 3, -10, 5])```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function find_max_sum that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray within the list.
The function first initializes max_sum to 0, which will be used to store the maximum sum found so far.
The function then enters a nested loop that iterates over all possible subarrays of the input list.
For each subarray, the code calculates the sum of the elements in the subarray and compares it to max_sum.
If the sum is greater than max_sum, the function updates max_sum to the current sum.
After the nested loop finishes, the function returns max_sum, which is the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray within the input list.
In this case, the input list is [1, 2, 3, -10, 5].
