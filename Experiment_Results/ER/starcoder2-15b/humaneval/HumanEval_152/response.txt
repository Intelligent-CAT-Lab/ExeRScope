The function compare takes two arguments: game and guess.
The function returns a list of absolute differences between corresponding elements of game and guess.
The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the elements of game and guess simultaneously using zip.
For each pair of elements x and y, it calculates the absolute difference between them and appends it to the list.
In the example, the function is called with game=[1,2,3,4,5,1] and guess=[1,2,3,4,2,-2].
The function returns [0,0,0,0,3,3], which is a list of absolute differences between corresponding elements of game and guess.
<<<Output>>>
[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
