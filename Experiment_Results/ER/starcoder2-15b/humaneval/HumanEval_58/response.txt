The function common takes two lists as input and returns a list of common elements between the two lists.
The function first initializes an empty set ret to store the common elements.
It then iterates through each element e1 in the first list l1.
For each element e1, it iterates through each element e2 in the second list l2.
If e1 and e2 are equal, it adds e1 to the set ret.
After the inner loop finishes, it returns the sorted list of elements in ret.
In this case, the function is called with two lists as arguments: [1, 4, 3, 34, 653, 2, 5] and [5, 7, 1, 5, 9, 653, 121].
The function iterates through each element in the first list and checks if it is present in the second list.
It finds that 1, 5 and 653 are common elements between the two lists.
The function then returns a sorted list of these common elements: [1, 5, 653].
<<<Output>>>
[1, 5, 653]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)```?First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
