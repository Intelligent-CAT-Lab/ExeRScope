The function rescale_to_unit takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list of numbers that have been rescaled to be between 0 and 1.
The function first finds the minimum and maximum values in the input list using the min() and max() functions.
It then calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values, which is the range of the input values.
The function then uses a list comprehension to create a new list of numbers that have been rescaled to be between 0 and 1.
For each number x in the input list, the function calculates the rescaled value by subtracting the minimum value from x and dividing by the range.
The function then returns the new list of rescaled numbers.
<<<Output>>>
[0.0, 1.0]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>

What would be the return value of ```sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)```?First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
