The code defines a function is_nested that takes a string as input and returns a boolean value.
It first initializes two empty lists, opening_bracket_index and closing_bracket_index, to store the indices of opening and closing brackets in the string.
Then, it iterates over the characters in the string and checks if each character is an opening or closing bracket. If it's an opening bracket, it appends its index to opening_bracket_index, and if it's a closing bracket, it appends its index to closing_bracket_index.
Next, it reverses the order of the elements in closing_bracket_index.
It then initializes a counter cnt to 0 and an index i to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the elements in opening_bracket_index. For each element idx, it checks if i is less than the length of closing_bracket_index and if idx is less than the corresponding element in closing_bracket_index. If both conditions are true, it increments cnt and i.
Finally, the code returns True if cnt is greater than or equal to 2, and False otherwise.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def is_palindrome(string):
    return string == string[::-1]
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```is_palindrome('abba')```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function is_palindrome that takes a string as input and returns a boolean value.
It returns True if the string is equal to its reverse, and False otherwise.
In this case, the input string is 'abba', which is the same as its reverse. Therefore, the function returns True.
