The function how_many_times takes two arguments: string and substring. It returns the number of times substring occurs in string.
In this case, the function is called with empty strings for both arguments.
The function starts by initializing the times variable to 0, which will be used to count the number of occurrences of substring in string.
The function then enters a loop that iterates over the range of indices from 0 to len(string) - len(substring) + 1. This range ensures that the substring can be fully contained within the string.
For each index i in the range, the function checks if the substring is present at that index in the string. If it is, it increments the times variable by 1.
Since the string and substring are both empty, the loop will not execute and the function will return 0.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>

The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
