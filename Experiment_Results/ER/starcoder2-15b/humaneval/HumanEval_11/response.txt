The function string_xor takes two strings a and b as input and returns a string representing the bitwise XOR of the two strings.
The function xor takes two characters i and j as input and returns the bitwise XOR of the two characters. If the two characters are the same, it returns '0', otherwise it returns '1'.
The function string_xor uses a generator expression to generate a string by applying the xor function to each pair of characters in the two input strings a and b. The zip function is used to iterate over the characters in the two strings simultaneously.
The function string_xor returns the resulting string.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>

The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
