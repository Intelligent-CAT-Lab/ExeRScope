The function next_smallest takes a list of integers as input and returns the second smallest element in the list.
The code first imports the typing module and defines the function next_smallest.
The function takes a single parameter lst, which is a list of integers.
The code then sorts the list and removes any duplicate elements using the sorted() and set() functions.
The function then returns None if the length of the list is less than 2, indicating that there is no second smallest element.
If the length of the list is greater than or equal to 2, the function returns the second smallest element in the list, which is the element at index 1 after sorting.
In the example, the input list is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. After sorting and removing duplicates, the list becomes [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. The length of the list is 5, which is greater than or equal to 2. The second smallest element is 2, which is the element at index 1 after sorting. Therefore, the function returns 2.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
