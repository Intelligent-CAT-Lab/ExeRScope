The function is_sorted takes a list of integers as input and returns a boolean value.
The function first creates a dictionary count_digit that maps each integer in the list to its frequency.
Then, it checks if any integer in the list has a frequency greater than 2. If so, it returns False.
Next, it checks if all the integers in the list are in ascending order. If so, it returns True.
Finally, if neither of the above conditions is met, it returns False.
In this case, the input list is [5], which only contains one element. Since all elements in the list are the same, they are in ascending order, and the frequency of each element is 1, which is less than or equal to 2. Therefore, the function returns True.

True

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def is_sorted(lst):
    count_digit = dict([(i, 0) for i in lst])
    for i in lst:
        count_digit[i]+=1 
    if any(count_digit[i] > 2 for i in lst):
        return False
    if all(lst[i-1] <= lst[i] for i in range(1, len(lst))):
        return True
    else:
        return False
    
    
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```is_sorted([1,2,3,4,5]) ```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Finally, if neither of the above conditions is met, it returns False.
In this case, the input list is [1,2,3,4,5,5], which is not in ascending order because the last two elements are not in ascending order. Therefore, the function returns False.
