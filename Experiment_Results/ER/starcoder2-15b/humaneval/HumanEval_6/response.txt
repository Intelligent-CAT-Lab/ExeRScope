The code defines a function parse_nested_parens that takes a string paren_string as input and returns a list of integers.
The function first defines a helper function parse_paren_group that takes a string s as input and returns the maximum depth of nested parentheses in s.
The function iterates through each character in s and keeps track of the current depth and maximum depth of nested parentheses.
If the current character is '(', the depth is increased by 1 and the maximum depth is updated if necessary.
If the current character is ')', the depth is decreased by 1.
After the loop finishes, the function returns the maximum depth.
The parse_nested_parens function then splits the input string paren_string on spaces and removes any empty strings.
It then applies the parse_paren_group function to each remaining string and returns a list of the resulting integers.
In this case, the input string is '(()()) ((())) () ((())()())'.
After splitting and removing empty strings, the list of strings becomes ['(()())', '((()))', '((())()())'].
The parse_paren_group function is applied to each of these strings, and the maximum depth of nested parentheses is calculated for each.
For '(()())', the maximum depth is 2.
For '((()))', the maximum depth is 2.
For '((())()())', the maximum depth is 3.
The function returns a list of these integers, which is [2, 2, 3].
<<<Output>>>
[2, 2, 3]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def find_max_sum(nums):
    max_sum = 0
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        for j in range(i, len(nums)):
            current_sum = sum(nums[i:j+1])
            max_sum = max(max_sum, current_sum)
    return max_sum
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```find_max_sum([1, 2, 3, -1, 4, -2, 5])```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The code defines a function find_max_sum that takes a list of numbers nums as input and returns the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray in nums.
The function iterates through all possible subarrays of nums using two nested loops.
The outer loop iterates through all possible starting indices i, and the inner loop iterates through all possible ending indices j.
For each subarray, the code calculates the sum of the elements in the subarray using the sum function and stores it in current_sum.
The function then updates max_sum to the maximum of max_sum and current_sum.
In this case, the input list is [1, 2, 3, -1, 4, -2, 5].
The outer loop iterates through all possible starting indices, which are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
For each starting index, the inner loop iterates through all possible ending indices, which are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
For example, for i = 0 and j = 2, the subarray is [1, 2, 3], and the sum of its elements is 6.
The function updates max_sum to the maximum of max_sum and current_sum, which is 6 in this case.
After the inner loop finishes, max_sum is 6.
The function then returns max_sum, which is 6.
<<<Output>>>
6
