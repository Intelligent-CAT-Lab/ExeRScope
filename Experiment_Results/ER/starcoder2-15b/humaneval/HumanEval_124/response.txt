The code defines a function valid_date that takes a string date as an argument.
It first removes any leading or trailing whitespace from the date using the strip() method.
Then it splits the date into three parts using the split('-') method, which separates the string based on the '-' character.
It converts the month, day, and year parts to integers using the int() function.
It then checks if the month is within the range of 1 to 12. If not, it returns False.
It checks if the day is within the range of 1 to 31 for months 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, and 12. If not, it returns False.
It checks if the day is within the range of 1 to 30 for months 4, 6, 9, and 11. If not, it returns False.
It checks if the day is within the range of 1 to 29 for month 2. If not, it returns False.
If none of the above conditions are met, it returns True.
In the main code, the function is called with the argument '03-11-2000'.
Since the month is 3, which is within the range of 1 to 12, and the day is 11, which is within the range of 1 to 31 for month 3, the function returns True.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1

What would be the return value of ```sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)```?First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
