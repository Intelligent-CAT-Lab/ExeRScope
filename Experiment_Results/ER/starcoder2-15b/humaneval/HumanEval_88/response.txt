The function sort_array takes an array of integers as input and returns a sorted array.
The code checks if the length of the array is 0, and if so, it returns an empty array.
If the length is not 0, it calculates the sum of the first and last elements of the array and checks if it is even.
If it is even, it sorts the array in descending order, otherwise it sorts it in ascending order.
In the given example, the first and last elements are 15 and 0, which sum to 15. Since 15 is odd, the array is sorted in ascending order.
The sorted array is returned.
<<<Output>>>
[0, 11, 15, 32, 42, 87]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>

What would be the return value of ```sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)```?First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
