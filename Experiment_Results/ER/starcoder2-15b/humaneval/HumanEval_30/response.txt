The function get_positive takes a list as input and returns a new list containing only the positive elements of the input list.
The code first imports the typing module and defines a function get_positive that takes a list as an argument.
The function returns a list comprehension that iterates over each element e in the input list l and adds it to the new list if e is greater than 0.
When called with the input [-1, -2, 4, 5, 6], the function returns a new list containing only the positive elements: [4, 5, 6].
<<<Output>>>
[4, 5, 6]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def get_sum(n):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```get_sum(5)```?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function get_sum takes an integer n as input and returns the sum of the first n positive integers.
The code first initializes a variable sum_1 to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of the integers.
The function then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider integers from 1 to 5.
For each integer i in this range, it adds it to sum_1.
After the loop finishes, the function returns the final value of sum_1, which is 15.
<<<Output>>>
15
