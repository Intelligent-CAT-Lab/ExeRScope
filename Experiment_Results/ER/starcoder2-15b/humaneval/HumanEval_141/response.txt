The variable file_name is initialized to "example.txt".
The code then defines a list suf containing three strings: 'txt', 'exe', and 'dll'.
The code then splits the file_name string using the '.' character as a separator and stores the result in lst.
The code then checks if the length of lst is not equal to 2. If it is not, it returns 'No'.
The code then checks if the second element of lst (lst[1]) is not in the suf list. If it is not, it returns 'No'.
The code then checks if the length of the first element of lst (lst[0]) is equal to 0. If it is, it returns 'No'.
The code then checks if the first character of lst[0] (lst[0][0]) is not an alphabetic character. If it is not, it returns 'No'.
The code then counts the number of digits in lst[0] using a list comprehension and stores the result in t.
The code then checks if t is greater than 3. If it is, it returns 'No'.
If none of the conditions are met, the code returns 'Yes'.
<<<Output>>>
Yes

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the return value of ```sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)```?First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
