**Significant analysis**: original deterministically-success (S) and deterministically-unsuccess(U) cases:

Codenet (200): #Sc = 94; #Uc = 61

Avatar(250): #Sa = 40; #Ua = 170

Total S = 134; U = 231

**To define complexity**:
Define complexity to show: 1) control flow complexity and 2) data flow complexity
1. Complexity from control flow â€”- decision points:
- Cognitive complexity (Cog)

2. Complexity from data flow:
- Operators/Operands (Unique/Total numbers of operators and operands, but Halstead Value (Hal) combines them)
- Def-use chain

Combination = Cog + Hal + Total_Use/Max_Use*Total_Def

**TODO:calculate the table; come up with more formula**


**Questions**
> 1- Do we need both cyclomatic complexity and cognitive complexity in the formula? Cog seems to subsume CC. 

Cog subsumes CC (per-function level), no need for CC.
[have modified Cog with adding comprehension]

> 2- Does the AST depth consider the complexity caused by trailing effect? This is specifically important because it challenges the "chain of though" of the LLMs, i.e., breaking down a bigger problem into smaller one. & Can use-def chain length be useful?

There are two files `tmp1.py` and `tmp2.py` with the following difference:

- AST depths of operators:

```
- def-use chain:
```
{'p': 4, 'x1': 2, 'y1': 2, 'x2': 2, 'y2': 2, 'DIF1': 2, 'DIF2': 2, 'x3': 1, 'y3': 1, 'x4': 1, 'y4': 1}

- Operators/Operands:
```

2. The following code `tmp2.py`:

```
- Operators/Operands:
```
unique_operators, all_operators, unique_operands, all_operands, (halstead effort)
2, 18, 14, 28, (282)
```

Overall:
- The average ast depths for each operator is higher
- The length of def-use is different, max `use` is higher 
- Tricky to consider operators locations in ast, ignore them.

> 3- What would be the difference between counting the number of operators and operands compared to considering their locations?
We should consider `the number of operators and operands` and `def-use`, but not focus on operators locations.
Locations(depths) can show the priority of operators, but this is not necessary to impacting complexity
